Files HX.txt (X = {1,7}) are the individual text files for each HP book

File H_series is a concatenation of all HX.txt files. Be careful when 
using it, the data is slightly modified. Hence, corrections are applied 
at the beginning of each script using this file. 

File book_labels.csv contains labels at the paragraph level to indicate
to which book each paragraph belongs.

special_data.txt contains H_series with all names replaced by a new
token "charrofocus"
