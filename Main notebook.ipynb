              "'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire by J.K. Rowling\\n\\nHARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE\\n\\nCHAPTER ONE � THE RIDDLE HOUSE\\n\\nThe villagers of Little Hangleron still called it \"the Riddle House,\" even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there. It stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face. Once a fine�looking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.\\n\\nThe Little Hagletons all agreed that the old house was \"creepy.\" Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce.\\n\\nThe story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore. Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer\\'s morning when the Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead.\\n\\nThe maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could.\\n\\n\"Lying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice! Still in their dinner things!\"\\n\\nThe police were summoned, and the whole of Little Hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill�disguised excitement. Nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they had been most unpopular.\\n\\nElderly Mr. and Mrs. Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown�up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse. All the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer �� for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night.\\n\\nThe Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night; the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders. They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles\\' cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just been arrested.\\n\\n\"Frank!\" cried several people. \"Never!\"\\n\\nFrank Bryce was the Riddles\\' gardener. He lived alone in a run�down cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since.\\n\\nThere was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.\\n\\n\"Always thought he was odd,\" she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry. \"Unfriendly, like. I\\'m sure if I\\'ve offered him a cuppa once, I\\'ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, now,\" said a woman at the bar, \"he had a hard war, Frank. He likes the quiet life. That\\'s no reason to ��\"\\n\\n\"Who else had a key to the back door, then?\" barked the cook. \"There\\'s been a spare key hanging in the gardener\\'s cottage far back as I can remember! Nobody forced the door last night! No broken windows! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping...\"\\n\\nThe villagers exchanged dark looks.\\n\\n\"I always thought that he had a nasty look about him, right enough,\" grunted a man at the bar.\\n\\n\"War turned him funny, if you ask me,\" said the landlord.\\n\\n\"Told you I wouldn\\'t like to get on the wrong side of Frank, didn\\'t I, Dot?\" said an excited woman in the corner.\\n\\n\"Horrible temper,\" said Dot, nodding fervently. \"I remember, when he was a kid...\"\\n\\nBy the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles.\\n\\nBut over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles\\' deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark�haired and pale. Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure Frank had invented him.\\n\\nThen, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on the Riddles\\' bodies came back and changed everything.\\n\\nThe police had never read an odder report. A team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangles, suffocated, or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all. In fact (the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all appeared to be in perfet health �� apart from the fact that they were all dead. The doctors did note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face �� but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to death!\\n\\nAs there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police were\\n\\nforced to let Frank go. The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while. To everyone\\'s surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.\\n\\n\"\\'S far as I\\'m concerned, he killed them, and I don\\'t care what the police say,\" said Dot in the Hanged Man. \"And if he had any decency, he\\'d leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.\"\\n\\nBut Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next �� for neither family stayed long.\\n\\nPerhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into disrepair.\\n\\nThe wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither lived there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept it for \"tax reasons,\" though nobody was very clear what these might be. The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening, however. Frank was nearing his seventy�seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them.\\n\\nWeeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either. Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle House.\\n\\nThey rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth.\\n\\nOnce or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare. They knew that old Frank\\'s devotion to the house and the grounds amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them. Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparents, though him a murderer. So when Frank awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him.\\n\\nIt was Frank\\'s bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever in his old age. He got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot�water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee. Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows. Frank knew at once what was going on. The boys had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering quality of the light, they had started a fire.\\n\\nFrank had no telephone, in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the Riddles\\' deaths. He put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door. He picked up his walking stick, which was propped against the wall,\\n\\nand set off into the night.\\n\\nThe front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, nor did any of the windows. Frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the door noiselessly.\\n\\nHe let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his way towards it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick.\\n\\nOn the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the intruders were: At the every end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor. Frank edged closer and closer, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.\\n\\nThe fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This surprised him. Then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man\\'s voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.\\n\\n\"There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you are still hungry.\"\\n\\n\"Later,\" said a second voice. This too belonged to a man �� but it was strangely high�pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind. Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank\\'s neck stand up. \"Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail.\"\\n\\nFrank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear. There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head. Then he went out of sight again.\\n\\n\"Where is Nagini?\" said the cold voice.\\n\\n\"I �� I don\\'t know, My Lord,\" said the first voice nervously. \"She set out to explore the house, I think...\"\\n\\n\"You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,\" said the second voice. \"I will need feeding in the night. The journey has tired me greatly.\"\\n\\nBrow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door, listening very hard. There was a pause, and then the man called Wormtail spoke again.\\n\\n\"My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?\"\\n\\n\"A week,\" said the cold voice. \"Perhapse longer. The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.\"\\n\\nFrank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word \"Quidditch,\" which was not a word at all.\\n\\n\"The �� the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?\" said Wormtail. (Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.) \"Forgive me, but �� I do not understand �� why should we wait until the World Cup is over?\"\\n\\n\"Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of ususual activity, checking and double�checking identities.\\n\\nThey will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we wait.\"\\n\\nFrank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard the words \"Ministry of Magic,\" \"wizards,\" and \"Muggles.\" Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.\\n\\n\"Your Lordship is still determined, then?\" Wormtail said quietly.\\n\\n\"Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.\" There was a note of menace in the cold voice now.\\n\\nA slight pause followed �� and the Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve.\\n\\n\"It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord.\"\\n\\nAnother pause, more protracted, and then �� \"Without Harry Potter?\" breathed the second voice softly. \"I see...\"\\n\\n\"My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!\" said Wormtail, his voice rising squeakily. \"The boy is nothing to me, nothing at all! It is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard �� any wizard �� the thing could be done so much more quickly! If you allowed me to leave you for a short while �� you know that I can disguise myself most effectively �� I could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person ��\"\\n\\n\"I could use another wizard,\" said the cold voice softly, \"that is true...\"\\n\\n\"My Lord, it makes sense,\" said Wormtail, sounding thoroughly relieved now.\\n\\n\"Laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult, he is so well protected ��\"\\n\\n\"And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute? I wonder...perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you, Wormtail? Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me?\"\\n\\n\"My Lord! I �� I have no wish to leave you, none at all ��\"\\n\\n\"Do not lie to me!\" hissed the second voice. \"I can always tell, Wormtail! You are regretting that you ever returned to me. I revolt you. I see you flinch when you look at me, feel you shudder when you touch me...\"\\n\\n\"No! My devotion to Your Lordship ��\"\\n\\n\"Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go. How am I to survive without you, when I need feeding every few hours? Who is to milk Nagini?\"\\n\\n\"But you seem so much stronger, My Lord ��\"\\n\\n\"Liar,\" breathed the second voice. \"I am no stronger, and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained under your clumsy care.\\n\\nSilence!\"\\n\\nWormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at once. For a few seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling. The the second man spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.\\n\\n\"I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained to you, and I will use no other. I have waited thirteen years. A few more months will make no difference. As for the protection surrounding the boy, I believe my plan will be effective. All that is needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail �� courage you will find, unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Voldermort\\'s wrath ��\"\\n\\n\"My Lord, I must speak!\" said Wormtail, panic in his voice now. \"All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head �� My Lord, Bertha Jorkin\\'s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if we proceed, if I murder ��\"\\n\\n\"If?\" whispered the second voice. \"If? If you follow the plan, Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died. You will do it quietly and without fuss; I only wish that i could do it myself, but in my present condition...Come, Wormtail, one more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear.\\n\\nI am not asking you to do it alone. By that time, my faithful serant will have rejoined us ��\"\\n\\n\"I am a faithful servant,\" said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in his voice.\\n\\n\"Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement.\"\\n\\n\"I found you,\" said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now. \"I was the one who found you. I brought you Bertha Jorkins.\"\\n\\n\"That is true,\" said the second man, sounding amused. \"A stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail �� though, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her, were you?\"\\n\\n\"I �� I thought she might be useful, My Lord ��\"\\n\\n\"Liar,\" said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever. \"However, I do not deny that her information was invaluable. Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail. I will allow you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform...\"\\n\\n\"R�really, My Lord? What �� ?\" Wormtail sounded terrified again.\\n\\n\"Ah, Wormtail, you don\\'t want me to spoil the surprise? Your part will come at the very end...but I promise you, you will have the honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins.\"\\n\\n\"You...you...\" Wormtail\\'s voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as though his mouth had gone very dry. \"You...are going...to kill me too?\"\\n\\n\"Wormtail, Wormtail,\" said the cold voice silkily, \"why would I kill you? I killed Bertha because I had to. She was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite useless. In any case, awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays. Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns...\"\\n\\nWormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh �� an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.\\n\\n\"We could have modified her memory? But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her. It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail.\"\\n\\nOut in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat. The man with the cold voice had killed a woman. He was talking about it without any kind of remorse �� with amusement.\\n\\nHe was dangerous �� a madman. And he was planning more murders �� this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was �� was in danger �� Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village...but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.\\n\\n\"One more murder...my faithful servant at Hogwarts...Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail. It is decided. There will be no more argument. But quiet...I think I hear Nagini...\"\\n\\nAnd the second man\\'s voice changed. He started making noises such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath. Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure.\\n\\nAnd then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway. He turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright.\\n\\nSomething was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long. Horrified, transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor, coming closer and closer �� What was he to do? The only means of escape was into the room where the two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him �� But before he had made his decision, the snake was level with him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following the spitting, hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in seconds, the tip of its diamond�patterned tail had vanished through the gap.\\n\\nThere was sweat on Frank\\'s forehead now, and the hand on the walking stick was trembling. Inside the room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible idea...This man could talk to snakes.\\n\\nFrank didn\\'t understand what was going on. He wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with his hot�water bottle. The problem was that his legs didn\\'t seem to want to move. As he stood there shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice switched abruptly to English again.\\n\\n\"Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail,\" it said.\\n\\n\"In�indeed, My Lord?\" said Wormtail.\\n\\n\"Indeed, yes,\" said the voice, \"According to Nagini, there is an old Muggle standing right outside this room, listening to every word we say.\"\\n\\nFrank didn\\'t have a chance to hide himself. There were footsteps and then the door of the room was flung wide open.\\n\\nA short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed nose, and small, watery eyes stood before Frank, a mixture of fear and alarm in his face.\\n\\n\"Invite him inside, Wormtail. Where are your manners?\"\\n\\nThe cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire, but Frank couldn\\'t see the speaker. the snake, on the other hand, was curled up on the rotting hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet dog.\\n\\nWormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still deeply shaken, Frank took a firmer grip on his walking stick and limped over the threshold.\\n\\nThe fire was the only source of light in the room; it cast long, spidery shadows upon the walls. Frank stared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank couldn\\'t even see the back of his head.\\n\\n\"You heard everything, Muggle?\" said the cold voice.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that you\\'re calling me?\" said Frank defiantly, for now that he was inside the room, now that the time had come for some sort of action, he felt braver; it had always been so in the war.\\n\\n\"I am calling you a Muggle,\" said the voice coolly. \"It means that you are not a wizard.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what you mean by wizard,\" said Frank, his voice growing steadier.\\n\\n\"All I know is I\\'ve heard enough to interest the police tonight, I have. You\\'ve done murder and you\\'re planning more! And I\\'ll tell youthis too,\" he added, on a sudden inspiration, \"my wife knows I\\'m up here, and if I don\\'t come back ��\"\\n\\n\"You have no wife,\" said te cold voice, very quietly. \"Nobody knows you are here.\\n\\nYou told nobody that you were coming. Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows...he always knows...\"\\n\\n\"Is that right?\" said Frank roughly. \"Lord, is it? Well, I don\\'t think much of your manners, My Lord. Turn \\'round and face me like a man, why don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"But I am not a man, Muggle,\" said the cold voice, barely audible now over the crackling of the flames. \"I am much, much more than a man. However...why not? I will face you...Wormtail, come turn my chair around.\"\\n\\nThe servant gave a whimper.\\n\\n\"You heard me, Wormtail.\"\\n\\nSlowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay, the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair. The snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.\\n\\nAnd then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it. His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter. He opened his mouth and let out a scream. He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was dead before he hit the floor.\\n\\nTwo hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with a start.\\n\\nCHAPTER TWO � THE SCAR\\n\\nHarry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been running. He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face. The old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white�hot wire to his skin.\\n\\nHe sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other hand reaching out in the darkness for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window.\\n\\nHarry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still painful. He turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the room, opened his wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door. A skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair. He examined the lightning�bolt scar of his reflection more closely. It looked normal, but it was still stinging.\\n\\nharry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken. It had seemed so real...There had been two people he knew and one he didn\\'t ...He concentrated hard, frowning, trying to remember...\\n\\nThe dim picture of a darkened room came to him...There had been a snake on a hearth rug...a small man called Peter, nicknamed Wormtail...and a cold, high voice...the voice of Lord Voldemort. Harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought...\\n\\nHe closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what Voldemort had looked like, but it was impossible...All Harry knew was that at the moment when Voldemort\\'s chair had swung around, and he, Harry, had seen what was sitting in it, he had felt a spasm of horror, which had awoken him...or had that been the pain in his scar!\\n\\nAnd who had the old man been? For there had definitely been an old man; Harry had watched him fall to the ground. It was all becoming confused. Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out his bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands; the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them...Voldemort and Wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed, though Harry could not remember the name...and they had been plotting to kill someone else...him!\\n\\nHarry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes, and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there. As it happened, there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room. A large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron, broomstick, black robes, and assorted spellbooks. Rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which his snowy owl, Hedwig,\\n\\nusually perched. On the floor beside his bed a book lay open; Harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night. The pictures in this book were all moving. Men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another.\\n\\nHarry walked over to the book, picked it up, and watched on of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty�foot�high hoop. Then he snapped the book shut. Even Quidditch �� in Harry\\'s opinion, the best sport in the world �� couldn\\'t distract him at the moment. He placed Flying with the Cannons on his bedside table, crossed to the window, and drew back the curtains to survey the street below.\\n\\nPrivet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look inthe early hours of Saturday morning. All the curtains were closed. As far as Harry could see through the darkness, there wasn\\'t a living creature in sight, not even a cat.\\n\\nAnd yet...and yet...Harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it, running a finger over his scar again. It wasn\\'t the pain that bothered him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night. The same arm had been pierced by a venemous foot�long fang not long afterward. Only last year Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborn broomstick. He was used to bizarre accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble.\\n\\nNo, the thing that was bothering Harry was the last time his scar had hurt him, it had been because Voldemort had been close by...But Voldemort couldn\\'t be here, now...The idea of Voldemort lurking in Privet Drive was absurd, impossible...\\n\\nHarry listened closely to the silence around him. Was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak? And then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room.\\n\\nHarry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid. There was no one in the house with him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, and they were plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and painless.\\n\\nAsleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best; it wasn\\'t as though they were ever any help to him awake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were Harry\\'s only living relatives. They were Muggles who hated and despised magic in any form, which meant that Harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot.\\n\\nThey had explained away Harry\\'s long absences at Hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to St. Brutus\\'s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. They knew perfectly well that, as an underage wizard, Harry wasn\\'t allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house. Harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world. The\\n\\nvery idea of going to them when they awoke, and telling them about his scar hurting him, and about his worries about Voldemort, was laughable.\\n\\nAnd yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had come to live with the Dursleys in the first place. If it hadn\\'t been for Voldemort, Harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead. If it hadn\\'t been for Voldemort, Harry would still have had parents...\\n\\nHarry had been a year old the night that Voldemort �� the most powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years �� arrived at his house and killed his father and mother. Voldemort had then turned his wand on Harry; he had performed the curse that had disposed of many full�grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power �� and, incredibly, it had not worked. Instead of killing the small boy, the curse had rebounded upon Voldemort. Harry had survived with nothing but a lightning�shaped cut on his forehead, and Voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive. His powers gone, his life almost extinguished, Voldemort had fled; the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted, Voldemort\\'s followers had disbanded, and Harry Potter had become famous.\\n\\nIt had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his eleventh birthday, that he was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name. Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went. But he was used to it now: At the end of this summer, he would be starting his fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again.\\n\\nBut there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school. He looked hopelessly around his room again, and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of July. What would they say if Harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting!\\n\\nAt once, Hermione Granger\\'s voice seemed to fill his head, shrill and panicky.\\n\\n\"Your scar hurt? Harry, that\\'s really serious.... Write to Professor Dumbledore!\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll go and check Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions.... Maybe there\\'s something in there about curse scars. . . .\"\\n\\nYes, that would be Hermione\\'s advice: Go straight to the headmaster of Hogwarts, and in the meantime, consult a book. Harry stared out of the window at the inky blue�black sky. He doubted very much whether a book could help him now. As far as he knew, he was the only living person to have survived a curse like Voldemort\\'s; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he would find his symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions. As for informing the headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumbledore went during the summer holidays. He amused himself for a moment, picturing Dumbledore, with his long silver beard, full length wizard\\'s robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach\\n\\nsomewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose. Wherever Dumbledore was, though, Harry was sure that Hedwig would be able to find him; Harry\\'s owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone, even without an address. But what would he write!\\n\\nDear Professor Dumbledore, Sorry to bother you, but my scar hurt this morning.\\n\\nYours sincerely, Harry Potter.\\n\\nEven inside his head the words sounded stupid.\\n\\nAnd so he tried to imagine his other best friend, Ron Weasley\\'s, reaction, and in a moment, Ron\\'s red hair and long�nosed, freckled face seemed to swim before Harry, wearing a bemused expression.\\n\\n\"Your scar hurt? But ... but You�Know�Who can\\'t be near you now, can he? I mean ... you\\'d know, wouldn\\'t you? He\\'d be trying to do you in again, wouldn\\'t be!\\n\\nI dunno, Harry, maybe curse scars always twinge a bit... I\\'ll ask Dad. . . .\"\\n\\nMr. Weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, but he didn\\'t have any particular expertise in the matter of curses, as far as Harry knew. In any case, Harry didn\\'t like the idea of the whole Weasley family knowing that he, Harry, was getting jumpy about a few moments\\' pain. Mrs. Weasley would fuss worse than Hermione, and Fred and George, Ron\\'s sixteen� year�old twin brothers, might think Harry was losing his nerve. The Weasleys were Harry\\'s favorite family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now (Ron had mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn\\'t want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.\\n\\nHarry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What he really wanted (and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself) was someone like � someone like a parent: an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid, someone who cared about him, who had had experience with Dark Magic....\\n\\nAnd then the solution came to him. It was so simple, and so obvious, that he couldn\\'t believe it had taken so long � Sirius.\\n\\nHarry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat down at his desk; he pulled a piece of parchment toward him, loaded his eagle�feather quill with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering how best to phrase his problem, still marveling at the fact that he hadn\\'t thought of Sirius straight away. But then, perhaps it wasn\\'t so surprising � after all, he had only found out that Sirius was his godfather two months ago.\\n\\nThere was a simple reason for Sirius\\'s complete absence from Harry\\'s life until then � Sirius had been in Azkaban, the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors, sightless, soul�sucking fiends who had come to search for Sirius at Hogwarts when he had escaped. Yet Sirius had been innocent � the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by Wormtail, Voldemort\\'s\\n\\nsupporter, whom nearly everybody now believed dead. Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew otherwise, however; they had come face�to�face with Wormtail only the previous year, though only Professor Dumbledore had believed their story.\\n\\nFor one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was leaving the Dursleys at last, because Sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared. But the chance had been snatched away from him � Wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to flee for his life.\\n\\nHarry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called Buckbeak, and since then, Sirius had been on the run. The home Harry might have had if Wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer. It had been doubly hard to return to the Dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever.\\n\\nNevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to Harry, even if he couldn\\'t be with him. It was due to Sirius that Harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him. The Dursleys had never allowed this before; their general wish of keeping Harry as miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his powers, had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this. But their attitude had changed since they had found out that Harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather � for Harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that Sirius was innocent.\\n\\nHarry had received two letters from Sirius since he had been back at Privet Drive.\\n\\nBoth had been delivered, not by owls (as was usual with wizards), but by large, brightly colored tropical birds. Hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders; she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again. Harry, on the other hand, had liked them; they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand, and he hoped that, wherever Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were intercepted), he was enjoying himself. Somehow, Harry found it hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight, perhapse that was why Sirius had gone South. Sirius\\'s letters, which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboards under Harry\\'s bed, sounded chearful, and in both of them he had reminded Harry to call on him if ever Harry needed to. Well, he needed to right now, all right...\\n\\nHarry\\'s lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room. Finally, when the sun had risen, when his bedroom walls had turned gold, and when sounds of movement could be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia\\'s room, Harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter.\\n\\nDear Sirius, Thanks for your last letter. That bird was enormous; it could hardly get through my window. Things are the same as usual here. Dudley\\'s diet isn\\'t going too well.\\n\\nMy aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday. They told him they\\'d have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it, so he got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window. That\\'s a sort of computer thing you\\n\\ncan play games on. Bit stupid really, now he hasn\\'t even got Mega�Mutilation Part Three to take his mind off things.\\n\\nI\\'m okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if I ask you to.\\n\\nA weird thing happened this morning, though. My scar hurt again. Last time that happened it was because Voldemort was at Hogwarts. But I don\\'t reckon he can be anywhere near me now, can he? Do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward!\\n\\nI\\'ll send this with Hedwig when she gets back; she\\'s off hunting at the moment.\\n\\nSay hello to Buckbeak for me. Harry Yes, thought Harry, that looked all right. There was no point putting in the dream; he didn\\'t want it to look as though he was too worried. He folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk, ready for when Hedwig returned. Then he got to his feet, stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more. Without glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast.\\n\\nCHAPTER THREE � THE INVITATION\\n\\nBy the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three Dursleys were already seated around the table. None of them looked up as he entered or sat down. Uncle Vernon\\'s large red face was hidden behind the morning\\'s Daily Mail, and Aunt Petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her horselike teeth.\\n\\nDudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual. This was saying something, as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself. When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto Dudley\\'s plate with a tremulous \"There you are, Diddy darling,\"\\n\\nDudley glowered at her. His life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his end�of�year report.\\n\\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual: Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn\\'t understand him, while Uncle Vernon maintained that \"he didn\\'t want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway.\" They also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report � \"He\\'s a boisterous little boy, but he wouldn\\'t hurt a fly!\" Aunt Petunia had said tearfully.\\n\\nHowever, at the bottom of the report there were a few well�chosen comments from the school nurse that not even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could explain away. No matter how much Aunt Petunia wailed that Dudley was big�boned, and that his poundage was really puppy fat, and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty of food, the fact remained that the school outfitters didn\\'t stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore. The school nurse had seen what Aunt Petunia\\'s eyes � so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors � simply refused to see: that far from needing extra nourishment, Dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale.\\n\\nSo � after many tantrums, after arguments that shook Harry\\'s bedroom floor, and many tears from Aunt Petunia � the new regime had begun. The diet sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been emptied of all Dudley\\'s favorite things � fizzy drinks and cakes, chocolate bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that Uncle Vernon called \"rabbit food.\" To make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too. She now passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed that it was a lot smaller than Dudley\\'s. Aunt Petunia seemed to feet that the best way to keep up Dudley\\'s morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get more to eat than Harry.\\n\\nBut Aunt Petunia didn\\'t know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs. She had no idea that Harry was not following the diet at all. The moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot\\n\\nsticks, Harry had sent Hedwig to his friends with pleas for help, and they had risen to the occasion magnificently. Hedwig had returned from Hermione\\'s house with a large box stuffed full of sugar�free snacks. (Hermione\\'s parents were dentists.) Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes. (Harry hadn\\'t touched these; he had had too much experience of Hagrid\\'s cooking.) Mrs. Weasley, however, had sent the family owl, Errol, with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies. Poor Errol, who was elderly and feeble, had needed a full five days to recover from the journey. And then on Harry\\'s birthday (which the Dursleys had completely ignored) he had received four superb birthday cakes, one each from Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and Sirius. Harry still had two of them left, and so, looking forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs, he ate his grapefruit without complaint.\\n\\nUncle Vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter.\\n\\n\"Is this it?\" he said grumpily to Aunt Petunia.\\n\\nAunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then nodded pointedly at Dudley, who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing Harry\\'s with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes.\\n\\nUncle Vernon gave a great sigh, which ruffled his large, bushy mustache, and picked up his spoon.\\n\\nThe doorbell rang. Uncle Vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off down the hall. Quick as a flash, while his mother was occupied with the kettle, Dudley stole the rest of Uncle Vernon\\'s grapefruit.\\n\\nHarry heard talking at the door, and someone laughing, and Uncle Vernon answering curtly. Then the front door closed, and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall.\\n\\nAunt Petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where Uncle Vernon had got to. She didn\\'t have to wait long to find out; after about a minute, he was back. He looked livid.\\n\\n\"You,\" he barked at Harry. \"In the living room. Now.\"\\n\\nBewildered, wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time, Harry got up and followed Uncle Vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room. Uncle Vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them.\\n\\n\"So,\" he said, marching over to the fireplace and turning to face Harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest. \"So.\"\\n\\nHarry would have dearly loved to have said, \"So what?\" but he didn\\'t feel that Uncle Vernon\\'s temper should be tested this early in the morning, especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food. He therefore settled for\\n\\nlooking politely puzzled.\\n\\n\"This just arrived,\" said Uncle Vernon. He brandished a piece of purple writing paper at Harry. \"A letter. About you.\"\\n\\nHarry\\'s confusion increased. Who would be writing to Uncle Vernon about him!\\n\\nWho did he know who sent letters by the postman!\\n\\nUncle Vernon glared at Harry, then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud: Dear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, We have never been introduced, but I am sure you have heard a great deal from Harry about my son Ron.\\n\\nAs Harry might have told you, the final of the Quidditch World Cup takes place this Monday night, and my husband, Arthur, has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the Department of Magical Games and Sports.\\n\\nI do hope you will allow us to take Harry to the match, as this really is a once�in�a� lifetime opportunity; Britain hasn\\'t hosted the cup for thirty years, and tickets are extremely hard to come by. We would of course be glad to have Harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays, and to see him safely onto the train back to school.\\n\\nIt would be best for Harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way, because the Muggle postman has never delivered to our house, and I am not sure he even knows where it is.\\n\\nHoping to see Harry soon, Yours sincerely, Molly Weasley P.S. I do hope we\\'ve put enough stamps on.\\n\\nUncle Vernon finished reading, put his hand back into his breast pocket, and drew out something else.\\n\\n\"Look at this,\" he growled.\\n\\nHe held up the envelope in which Mrs. Weasley\\'s letter had come, and Harry had to fight down a laugh. Every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front, into which Mrs. Weasley had squeezed the Dursleys\\' address in minute writing.\\n\\n\"She did put enough stamps on, then,\" said Harry, trying to sound as though Mrs.\\n\\nWeasley\\'s was a mistake anyone could make. His uncle\\'s eyes flashed.\\n\\n\"The postman noticed,\" he said through gritted teeth. \"Very interested to know where this letter came from, he was. That\\'s why he rang the doorbell. Seemed to think it was funny.\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t say anything. Other people might not understand why Uncle Vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps, but Harry had lived with the Dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary. Their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected (however distantly) with people like Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\nUncle Vernon was still glaring at Harry, who tried to keep his expression neutral.\\n\\nIf he didn\\'t do or say anything stupid, he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime.\\n\\nHe waited for Uncle Vernon to say something, but he merely continued to glare.\\n\\nHarry decided to break the silence.\\n\\n\"So � can I go then?\" he asked.\\n\\nA slight spasm crossed Uncle Vernon\\'s large purple face. The mustache bristled.\\n\\nHarry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache: a furious battle as two of Uncle Vernon\\'s most fundamental instincts came into conflict. Allowing Harry to go would make Harry happy, something Uncle Vernon had struggled against for thirteen years. On the other hand, allowing Harry to disappear to the Weasleys\\' for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and Uncle Vernon hated having Harry in the house. To give himself thinking time, it seemed, he looked down at Mrs. Weasley\\'s letter again.\\n\\n\"Who is this woman?\" he said, staring at the signature with distaste.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve seen her,\" said Harry. \"She\\'s my friend Ron\\'s mother, she was meeting him off the Hog � off the school train at the end of last term.\"\\n\\nHe had almost said \"Hogwarts Express,\" and that was a sure way to get his uncle\\'s temper up. Nobody ever mentioned the name of Harry\\'s school aloud in the Dursley household.\\n\\nUncle Vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant.\\n\\n\"Dumpy sort of woman?\" he growled finally. \"Load of children with red hair?\"\\n\\nHarry frowned. He thought it was a bit rich of Uncle Vernon to call anyone \"dumpy,\" when his own son, Dudley, had finally achieved what he\\'d been threatening to do since the age of three, and become wider than he was tall.\\n\\nUncle Vernon was perusing the letter again.\\n\\n\"Quidditch,\" he muttered under his breath. \"Quidditch � what is this rubbish?\"\\n\\nHarry felt a second stab of annoyance.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a sport,\" he said shortly. \"Played on broom� \"\\n\\n\"All right, all right!\" said Uncle Vernon loudly. Harry saw, with some satisfaction, that his uncle looked vaguely panicky. Apparently his nerves couldn\\'t stand the sound of the word \"broomsticks\" in his living room. He took refuge in perusing the letter again. Harry saw his lips form the words \"send us your answer ... in the normal way.\" He scowled.\\n\\n\"What does she mean, \\'the normal way\\'?\" he spat.\\n\\n\"Normal for us,\" said Harry, and before his uncle could stop him, he added, \"you know, owl post. That\\'s what\\'s normal for wizards.\"\\n\\nUncle Vernon looked as outraged as if Harry had just uttered a disgusting swearword. Shaking with anger, he shot a nervous look through the window, as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass.\\n\\n\"How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof?\" he hissed, his face now a rich plum color. \"You stand there, in the clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back �\"\\n\\n\"Only after Dudley finished with them,\" said Harry coldly, and indeed, he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands, and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans.\\n\\n\"I will not be spoken to like that!\" said Uncle Vernon, trembling with rage.\\n\\nBut Harry wasn\\'t going to stand for this. Gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the Dursleys\\' stupid rules. He wasn\\'t following Dudley\\'s diet, and he wasn\\'t going to let Uncle Vernon stop him from going to the Quidditch World Cup, not if he could help it. Harry took a deep, steadying breath and then said, \"Okay, I can\\'t see the World Cup. Can I go now, then? Only I\\'ve got a letter to Sirius I want to finish. You know � my godfather.\"\\n\\nHe had done it, he had said the magic words. Now he watched the purple recede blotchily from Uncle Vernon\\'s face, making it look like badly mixed black currant ice cream.\\n\\n\"You\\'re � you\\'re writing to him, are you?\" said Uncle Vernon, in a would�be calm voice � but Harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear.\\n\\n\"Well � yeah,\" said Harry, casually. \"It\\'s been a while since he heard from me, and, you know, if he doesn\\'t he might start thinking something\\'s wrong.\"\\n\\nHe stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words. He could almost see the cogs working under Uncle Vernon\\'s thick, dark, neatly parted hair. If he tried to stop Harry writing to Sirius, Sirius would think Harry was being mistreated. If he told Harry he couldn\\'t go to the Quidditch World Cup, Harry would write and tell\\n\\nSirius, who would know Harry was being mistreated. There was only one thing for Uncle Vernon to do. Harry could see the conclusion forming in his uncle\\'s mind as though the great mustached face were transparent. Harry tried not to smile, to keep his own face as blank as possible. And then � \"Well, all right then. You can go to this ruddy ... this stupid ... this World Cup thing. You write and tell these � these Weasleys they\\'re to pick you up, mind. I haven\\'t got time to go dropping you off all over the country. And you can spend the rest of the summer there. And you can tell your � your godfather ... tell him ...\\n\\ntell him you\\'re going.\"\\n\\n\"Okay then,\" said Harry brightly.\\n\\nHe turned and walked toward the living room door, fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop. He was going ... he was going to the Weasleys\\', he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup!\\n\\nOutside in the hall he nearly ran into Dudley, who had been lurking behind the door, clearly hoping to overhear Harry being told off. He looked shocked to see the broad grin on Harry\\'s face.\\n\\n\"That was an excellent breakfast, wasn\\'t it?\" said Harry. \"I feel really full, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\nLaughing at the astonished look on Dudley\\'s face, Harry took the stairs three at a time, and hurled himself back into his bedroom.\\n\\nThe first thing he saw was that Hedwig was back. She was sitting in her cage, staring at Harry with her enormous amber eyes, and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something. Exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at once.\\n\\n\"OUCH!\" said Harry as what appeared to be a small, gray, feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head. Harry massaged the spot furiously, looking up to see what had hit him, and saw a minute owl, small enough to fit into the palm of his hand, whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework. Harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet. Harry bent down, recognized Ron\\'s handwriting, then tore open the envelope. Inside was a hastily scribbled note.\\n\\nHarry � DAD GOT THE TICKETS � Ireland versus Bulgaria, Monday night.\\n\\nMum\\'s writing to the Muggles to ask you to stay. They might already have the letter, I don\\'t know how fast Muggle post is. Thought I\\'d send this with Pig anyway.\\n\\nHarry stared at the word \"Pig,\" then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling. He had never seen anything that looked less like a pig. Maybe he couldn\\'t read Ron\\'s writing. He went back to the letter:\\n\\nWe\\'re coming for you whether the Muggles like it or not, you can\\'t miss the World Cup, only Mum and Dad reckon it\\'s better if we pretend to ask their permission first. If they say yes, send Pig back with your answer pronto, and we\\'ll come and get you at five o\\'clock on Sunday. If they say no, send Pig back pronto and we\\'ll come and get you at five o\\'clock on Sunday anyway.\\n\\nHermione\\'s arriving this afternoon. Percy\\'s started work � the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Don\\'t mention anything about Abroad while you\\'re here unless you want the pants bored off you.\\n\\nSee you soon � Ron \"Calm down!\" Harry said as the small owl flew low over his head, twittering madly with what Harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person. \"Come here, I need you to take my answer back!\"\\n\\nThe owl fluttered down on top of Hedwig\\'s cage. Hedwig looked coldly up at it, as though daring it to try and come any closer.\\n\\nHarry seized his eagle�feather quill once more, grabbed a fresh piece of parchment, and wrote: Ron, it\\'s all okay, the Muggles say I can come. See you five o\\'clock tomorrow.\\n\\nCan\\'t wait. Harry He folded this note up very small, and with immense difficulty, tied it to the tiny owl\\'s leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement. The moment the note was secure, the owl was off again; it zoomed out of the window and out of sight.\\n\\nHarry turned to Hedwig.\\n\\n\"Feeling up to a long journey?\" he asked her.\\n\\nHedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a way.\\n\\n\"Can you take this to Sirius for me?\" he said, picking up his letter. \"Hang on ... I just want to finish it.\"\\n\\nHe unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript.\\n\\nIf you want to contact me, I\\'ll be at my friend Ron Weasley\\'s for the rest of the summer. His dad\\'s got us tickets for the Quidditch World Cup!\\n\\nThe letter finished, he tied it to Hedwig\\'s leg; she kept unusually still, as though determined to show him how a real post owl should behave.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be at Ron\\'s when you get back, all right?\" Harry told her.\\n\\nShe nipped his finger affectionately, then, with a soft swooshing noise, spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open window.\\n\\nHarry watched her out of sight, then crawled under his bed, wrenched up the loose floorboard, and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake. He sat there on the floor eating it, savoring the happiness that was flooding through him. He had cake, and Dudley had nothing but grapefruit; it was a bright summer\\'s day, he would be leaving Privet Drive tomorrow, his scar felt perfectly normal again, and he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup. It was hard, just now, to feel worried about anything � even Lord Voldemort.\\n\\nCHAPTER FOUR � BACK TO THE BURROW\\n\\nBy twelve o\\'clock the next day, Harry\\'s school trunk was packed with his school things and all his most prized possessions � the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father, the broomstick he had gotten from Sirius, the enchanted map of Hogwarts he had been given by Fred and George Weasley last year. He had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food, double�checked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills, and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to September the first, on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to Hogwarts.\\n\\nThe atmosphere inside number four, Privet Drive was extremely tense. The imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was making the Dursleys uptight and irritable. Uncle Vernon had looked downright alarmed when Harry informed him that the Weasleys would be arriving at five o\\'clock the very next day.\\n\\n\"I hope you told them to dress properly, these people,\" he snarled at once. \"I\\'ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear. They\\'d better have the decency to put on normal clothes, that\\'s all.\"\\n\\nHarry felt a slight sense of foreboding. He had rarely seen Mr. or Mrs. Weasley wearing anything that the Dursleys would call \"normal.\" Their children might don Muggle clothing during the holidays, but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness. Harry wasn\\'t bothered about what the neighbors would think, but he was anxious about how rude the Dursleys might be to the Weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards.\\n\\nUncle Vernon had put on his best suit. To some people, this might have looked like a gesture of welcome, but Harry knew it was because Uncle Vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating. Dudley, on the other hand, looked somehow diminished. This was not because the diet was at last taking effect, but due to fright. Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pig\\'s tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in London. It wasn\\'t altogether surprising, therefore, that Dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside, and walking sideways from room to room, so as not to present the same target to the enemy.\\n\\nLunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didn\\'t even protest at the food (cottage cheese and grated celery). Aunt Petunia wasn\\'t, eating anything at all. Her arms were folded, her lips were pursed, and she seemed to be chewing her tongue, as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at Harry.\\n\\n\"They\\'ll be driving, of course?\" Uncle Vernon barked across the table.\\n\\n\"Er,\" said Harry.\\n\\nHe hadn\\'t thought of that. How were the Weasleys going to pick him up? They didn\\'t have a car anymore; the old Ford Anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts. But Mr. Weasley had borrowed a Ministry of Magic car last year; possibly he would do the same today!\\n\\n\"I think so,\" said Harry.\\n\\nUncle Vernon snorted into his mustache. Normally, Uncle Vernon would have asked what car Mr. Weasley drove; he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were. But Harry doubted whether Uncle Vernon would have taken to Mr. Weasley even if he drove a Ferrari.\\n\\nHarry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom; he couldn\\'t stand watching Aunt Petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds, as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros. Finally, at a quarter to five, Harry went back downstairs and into the living room.\\n\\nAunt Petunia was compulsively straightening cushions. Uncle Vernon was pretending to read the paper, but his tiny eyes were not moving, and Harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car.\\n\\nDudley was crammed into an armchair, his porky hands beneath him, clamped firmly around his bottom. Harry couldn\\'t take the tension; he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves.\\n\\nBut five o\\'clock came and then went. Uncle Vernon, perspiring slightly in his suit, opened the front door, peered up and down the street, then withdrew his head quickly.\\n\\n\"They\\'re late!\" he snarled at Harry.\\n\\nI know,\" said Harry. \"Maybe � er � the traffic\\'s bad, or something.\"\\n\\nTen past five ... then a quarter past five ... Harry was starting to feel anxious himself now. At half past, he heard Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room.\\n\\n\"No consideration at all.\"\\n\\n\"We might\\'ve had an engagement.\"\\n\\n\"Maybe they think they\\'ll get invited to dinner if they\\'re late.\"\\n\\n\"Well, they most certainly won\\'t be,\" said Uncle Vernon, and Harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room. \"They\\'ll take the boy and go, there\\'ll be no hanging around. That\\'s if they\\'re coming at all. Probably mistaken the day. I daresay their kind don\\'t set much store by punctuality. Either that or they drive some tin�pot car that\\'s broken d� AAAAAAAARRRRRGH!\"\\n\\nHarry jumped up. From the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three Dursleys scrambling, panic�stricken, across the room. Next moment Dudley came flying into the hall, looking terrified.\\n\\n\"What happened?\" said Harry. \"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n\\nBut Dudley didn\\'t seem able to speak. Hands still clamped over his buttocks, he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen. Harry hurried into the living room.\\n\\nLoud bangings and scrapings were coming from behind the Dursleys\\' boarded�up fireplace, which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed into the wall and was staring, terrified, toward the fire. \"What is it, Vernon?\"\\n\\nBut they were left in doubt barely a second longer. Voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace.\\n\\n\"Ouch! Fred, no � go back, go back, there\\'s been some kind of mistake � tell George not to � OUCH! George, no, there\\'s no room, go back quickly and tell Ron� �\\n\\n\"Maybe Harry can hear us, Dad � maybe he\\'ll be able to let us out�\"\\n\\nThere was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric fire.\\n\\n\"Harry? Harry, can you hear us?\"\\n\\nThe Dursleys rounded on Harry like a pair of angry wolverines.\\n\\n\"What is this?\" growled Uncle Vernon. \"What\\'s going on?\"\\n\\n\"They � they\\'ve tried to get here by Floo powder,\" said Harry, fighting a mad desire to laugh. \"They can travel by fire � only you\\'ve blocked the fireplace � hang on �\"\\n\\nHe approached the fireplace and called through the boards.\\n\\n\"Mr. Weasley? Can you hear me?\"\\n\\nThe hammering stopped. Somebody inside the chimney piece said, \"Shh!\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Weasley, it\\'s Harry ... the fireplace has been blocked up. You won\\'t be able to get through there.\"\\n\\n\"Damn!\" said Mr. Weasley\\'s voice. \"What on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for?\"\\n\\n\"They\\'ve got an electric fire,\" Harry explained.\\n\\n\"Really?\" said Mr. Weasley\\'s voice excitedly. \"Eclectic, you say? With a plug!\\n\\nGracious, I must see that.... Let\\'s think ... ouch, Ron!\"\\n\\nRon\\'s voice now joined the others\\'.\\n\\n\"What are we doing here? Has something gone wrong?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no, Ron,\" came Fred\\'s voice, very sarcastically. \"No, this is exactly where we wanted to end up.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, we\\'re having the time of our lives here,\" said George, whose voice sounded muffled, as though he was squashed against the wall.\\n\\n\"Boys, boys. . .\" said Mr. Weasley vaguely. \"I\\'m trying to think what to do.... Yes ... only way. . . Stand back, Harry.\"\\n\\nHarry retreated to the sofa. Uncle Vernon, however, moved forward.\\n\\n\"Wait a moment!\" he bellowed at the fire. \"What exactly are you going to �\"\\n\\nBANG.\\n\\nThe electric fire shot across the room as the boarded�up fireplace burst outward, expelling Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, and Ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings. Aunt Petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table; Uncle Vernon caught her before she hit the floor, and gaped, speechless, at the Weasleys, all of whom had bright red hair, including Fred and George, who were identical to the last freckle.\\n\\n\"That\\'s better,\" panted Mr. Weasley, brushing dust from his long green robes and straightening his glasses. \"Ah � you must be Harry\\'s aunt and uncle!\"\\n\\nTall, thin, and balding, he moved toward Uncle Vernon, his hand outstretched, but Uncle Vernon backed away several paces, dragging Aunt Petunia. Words utterly failed Uncle Vernon. His best suit was covered in white dust, which had settled in his hair and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty years.\\n\\n\"Er � yes � sorry about that,\" said Mr. Weasley, lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace. \"It\\'s all my fault. It just didn\\'t occur to me that we wouldn\\'t be able to get out at the other end. I had your fireplace connected to the Floo Network, you see � just for an afternoon, you know, so we could get Harry. Muggle fireplaces aren\\'t supposed to be connected, strictly speaking � but I\\'ve got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it for me. I can put it right in a jiffy, though, don\\'t worry. I\\'ll light a fire to send the boys back, and then I can repair your fireplace before I Disapparate.\"\\n\\nHarry was ready to bet that the Dursleys hadn\\'t understood a single word of this.\\n\\nThey were still gaping at Mr. Weasley, thunderstruck. Aunt Petunia staggered upright again and hid behind Uncle Vernon.\\n\\n\"Hello, Harry!\" said Mr. Weasley brightly. \"Got your trunk ready?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s upstairs,\" said Harry, grinning back.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll get it,\" said Fred at once. Winking at Harry, he and George left the room.\\n\\nThey knew where Harry\\'s bedroom was, having once rescued him from it in the dead of night. Harry suspected that Fred and George were hoping for a glimpse of Dudley; they had heard a lot about him from Harry.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Weasley, swinging his arms slightly, while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence. \"Very � erm � very nice place you\\'ve got here.\"\\n\\nAs the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick, this remark didn\\'t go down too well with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon\\'s face purpled once more, and Aunt Petunia started chewing her tongue again. However, they seemed too scared to actually say anything.\\n\\nMr. Weasley was looking around. He loved everything to do with Muggles. Harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder.\\n\\n\"They run off eckeltricity, do they?\" he said knowledgeably. \"Ah yes, I can see the plugs. I collect plugs,\" he added to Uncle Vernon. \"And batteries. Got a very large collection of batteries. My wife thinks I\\'m mad, but there you are.\"\\n\\nUncle Vernon clearly thought Mr. Weasley was mad too. He moved ever so slightly to the right, screening Aunt Petunia from view, as though he thought Mr.\\n\\nWeasley might suddenly run at them and attack.\\n\\nDudley suddenly reappeared in the room. Harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had scared Dudley out of the kitchen.\\n\\nDudley edged along the wall, gazing at Mr. Weasley with terrified eyes, and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father. Unfortunately, Uncle Vernon\\'s bulk, while sufficient to hide bony Aunt Petunia, was nowhere near enough to conceal Dudley.\\n\\n\"Ah, this is your cousin, is it, Harry?\" said Mr. Weasley, taking another brave stab at making conversation.\\n\\n\"Yep,\" said Harry, \"that\\'s Dudley.\"\\n\\nHe and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming. Dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off. Mr. Weasley, however, seemed genuinely concerned at Dudley\\'s peculiar behavior. Indeed, from the tone of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr. Weasley thought Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought he was, except that Mr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear.\\n\\n\"Having a good holiday, Dudley?\" he said kindly.\\n\\nDudley whimpered. Harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive backside.\\n\\nFred and George came back into the room carrying Harry\\'s school trunk. They\\n\\nglanced around as they entered and spotted Dudley. Their faces cracked into identical evil grins.\\n\\n\"Ah, right,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Better get cracking then.\"\\n\\nHe pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand. Harry saw the Dursleys draw back against the wall as one.\\n\\n\"Incendio!\" said Mr. Weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him.\\n\\nFlames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours. Mr. Weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket, untied it, took a pinch of the powder inside, and threw it onto the flames, which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever.\\n\\n\"Off you go then, Fred,\" said Mr. Weasley.\\n\\n\"Coming,\" said Fred. \"Oh no � hang on �\"\\n\\nA bag of sweets had spilled out of Fred\\'s pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction � big, fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers.\\n\\nFred scrambled around, cramming them back into his pocket, then gave the Dursleys a cheery wave, stepped forward, and walked right into the fire, saying \"the Burrow!\" Aunt Petunia gave a little shuddering gasp. There was a whooshing sound, and Fred vanished.\\n\\n\"Right then, George,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"you and the trunk.\"\\n\\nHarry helped George carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better. Then, with a second whoosh, George had cried \"the Burrow!\" and vanished too.\\n\\n\"Ron, you next,\" said Mr. Weasley.\\n\\n\"See you,\" said Ron brightly to the Dursleys. He grinned broadly at Harry, then stepped into the fire, shouted \"the Burrow!\" and disappeared.\\n\\nNow Harry and Mr. Weasley alone remained.\\n\\n\"Well . . . \\'bye then,\" Harry said to the Dursleys.\\n\\nThey didn\\'t say anything at all. Harry moved toward the fire, but just as he reached the edge of the hearth, Mr. Weasley put out a hand and held him back. He was looking at the Dursleys in amazement.\\n\\n\"Harry said good�bye to you,\" he said. \"Didn\\'t you hear him?\"\\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter,\" Harry muttered to Mr. Weasley. \"Honestly, I don\\'t care.\"\\n\\nMr. Weasley did not remove his hand from Harry\\'s shoulder.\\n\\n\"You aren\\'t going to see your nephew till next summer,\" he said to Uncle Vernon in mild indignation. \"Surely you\\'re going to say good�bye?\"\\n\\nUncle Vernon\\'s face worked furiously. The idea of being taught consideration by a man who had just blasted away half his living room wall seemed to be causing him intense suffering. But Mr. Weasley\\'s wand was still in his hand, and Uncle Vernon\\'s tiny eyes darted to it once, before he said, very resentfully, \"Good�bye, then.\"\\n\\n\"See you,\" said Harry, putting one foot forward into the green flames, which felt pleasantly like warm breath. At that moment, however, a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him, and Aunt Petunia started to scream.\\n\\nHarry wheeled around. Dudley was no longer standing behind his parents. He was kneeling beside the coffee table, and he was gagging and sputtering on a foot�long, purple, slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth. One bewildered second later, Harry realized that the foot�long thing was Dudley\\'s tongue � and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him.\\n\\nAunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley, seized the end of his swollen tongue, and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth; unsurprisingly, Dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever, trying to fight her off. Uncle Vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around, and Mr. Weasley had to shout to make himself heard.\\n\\n\"Not to worry, I can sort him out!\" he yelled, advancing on Dudley with his wand outstretched, but Aunt Petunia screamed worse than ever and threw herself on top of Dudley, shielding him from Mr. Weasley.\\n\\n\"No, really!\" said Mr. Weasley desperately. \"It\\'s a simple process it was the toffee � my son Fred � real practical joker � but it\\'s only an Engorgement Charm � at least, I think it is � please, I can correct it �\"\\n\\nBut far from being reassured, the Dursleys became more panic� stricken; Aunt Petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging Dudley\\'s tongue as though determined to rip it out; Dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had lost control completely, seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at Mr. Weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace.\\n\\n\"Now really!\" said Mr. Weasley angrily, brandishing his wand. \"I\\'m trying to help!\"\\n\\nBellowing like a wounded hippo, Uncle Vernon snatched up another ornament.\\n\\n\"Harry, go! Just go!\" Mr. Weasley shouted, his wand on Uncle Vernon. \"I\\'ll sort this out!\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon\\'s second ornament narrowly\\n\\nmissed his left ear, and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to Mr.\\n\\nWeasley. He stepped into the fire, looking over his shoulder as he said \"the Burrow!\" His last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of Mr. Weasley blasting a third ornament out of Uncle Vernon\\'s hand with his wand, Aunt Petunia screaming and lying on top of Dudley, and Dudley\\'s tongue lolling around like a great slimy python. But next moment Harry had begun to spin very fast, and the Dursleys\\' living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald�green flames.\\n\\nCHAPTER FIVE � WEASLEYS\\' WIZARD WHEEZES\\n\\nHarry spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to his sides, blurred fireplaces flashing past him, until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes. Then, when at last he felt himself slowing down, he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the Weasleys\\' kitchen fire.\\n\\n\"Did he eat it?\" said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull Harry to his fee \"Yeah,\" said Harry, straightening up. \"What was it?\"\\n\\n\"Ton�Tongue Toffee,\" said Fred brightly. \"George and I invented them, and we\\'ve been looking for someone to test them on all summer. . . .\"\\n\\nThe tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry looked around and saw that Ron and George were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red�haired people Harry had never seen before, though he knew immediately who they must be: Bill and Charlie, the two eldest Weasley brothers.\\n\\n\"How\\'re you doing, Harry?\" said the nearer of the two, grinning at him and holding out a large hand, which Harry shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers. This had to be Charlie, who worked with dragons in Romania. Charlie was built like the twins, shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who were both long and lanky. He had a broad, good�natured face, which was weather�beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his arms were muscular, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it.\\n\\nBill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry\\'s hand. Bill came as something of a surprise. Harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank, Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at Hogwarts; Harry had always imagined Bill to be an older version of Percy: fussy about rule�breaking and fond of bossing everyone around. However, Bill was � there was no other word for it � cool. He was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail. He was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it. Bill\\'s clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert, except that Harry recognized his boots to be made, not of leather, but of dragon hide.\\n\\nBefore any of them could say anything else, there was a faint popping noise, and Mr. Weasley appeared out of thin air at George\\'s shoulder. He was looking angrier than Harry had ever seen him.\\n\\n\"That wasn\\'t funny Fred!\" he shouted. \"What on earth did you give that Muggle boy?\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t give him anything,\" said Fred, with another evil grin. I just dropped it.... It was his fault he went and ate it, I never told him to.\"\\n\\n\"You dropped it on purpose!\" roared Mr. Weasley. \"You knew he\\'d eat it, you knew he was on a diet �\"\\n\\n\"How big did his tongue get?\" George asked eagerly.\\n\\n\"It was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it!\"\\n\\nHarry and the Weasleys roared with laughter again.\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t funny!\" Mr. Weasley shouted. \"That sort of behavior seriously undermines wizard�Muggle relations! I spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of Muggles, and my own sons \"We didn\\'t give it to him because he\\'s a Muggle!\" said Fred indignantly.\\n\\n\"No, we gave it to him because he\\'s a great bullying git,\" said George. \"Isn\\'t he, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, he is, Mr. Weasley,\" said Harry earnestly.\\n\\n\"That\\'s not the point!\" raged Mr. Weasley. \"You wait until I tell your mother �\"\\n\\n\"Tell me what?\" said a voice behind them.\\n\\nMrs. Weasley had just entered the kitchen. She was a short, plump woman with a very kind face, though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion.\\n\\n\"Oh hello, Harry, dear,\" she said, spotting him and smiling. Then her eyes snapped back to her husband. \"Tell me what, Arthur?\"\\n\\nMr. Weasley hesitated. Harry could tell that, however angry he was with Fred and George, he hadn\\'t really intended to tell Mrs. Weasley what had happened. There was a silence, while Mr. Weasley eyed his wife nervously. Then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind Mrs. Weasley. One, with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth, was Harry\\'s and Ron\\'s friend, Hermione Granger. The other, who was small and red�haired, was Ron\\'s younger sister, Ginny. Both of them smiled at Harry, who grinned back, which made Ginny go scarlet � she had been very taken with Harry ever since his first visit to the Burrow.\\n\\n\"Tell me what, Arthur?\" Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a dangerous sort of voice.\\n\\n\"It\\'s nothing, Molly,\" mumbled Mr. Weasley, \"Fred and George just � but I\\'ve had words with them �\"\\n\\n\"What have they done this time?\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"If it\\'s got anything to do with Weasleys\\' Wizard Wheezes �\"\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you show Harry where he\\'s sleeping, Ron?\" said Hermione from the doorway.\\n\\n\"He knows where he\\'s sleeping,\" said Ron, \"in my room, he slept there last �\"\\n\\n\"We can all go,\" said Hermione pointedly.\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Ron, cottoning on. \"Right.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, we\\'ll come too,\" said George.\\n\\n\"You stay where you are!\" snarled Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\nHarry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories.\\n\\n\"What are Weasleys\\' Wizard Wheezes?\" Harry asked as they climbed.\\n\\nRon and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn\\'t.\\n\\n\"Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George\\'s room,\" said Ron quietly. \"Great long price lists for stuff they\\'ve invented. Joke stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff. It was brilliant, I never knew they\\'d been inventing all that . . .\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never thought they were actually making things,\" said Ginny. \"We thought they just liked the noise.\"\\n\\n\"Only, most of the stuff � well, all of it, really � was a bit dangerous,\" said Ron, \"and, you know, they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money, and Mum went mad at them. Told them they weren\\'t allowed to make any more of it, and burned all the order forms.... She\\'s furious at them anyway. They didn\\'t get as many O.W.L.s as she expected.\"\\n\\nO.W.L.s were Ordinary Wizarding Levels, the examinations Hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen.\\n\\n\"And then there was this big row,\" Ginny said, \"because Mum wants them to go into the Ministry of Magic like Dad, and they told her all they want to do is open a joke shop.\"\\n\\nJust then a door on the second landing opened, and a face poked out wearing horn� rimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression.\\n\\n\"Hi, Percy,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Oh hello, Harry,\" said Percy. \"I was wondering who was making all the noise.\\n\\nI\\'m trying to work in here, you know I\\'ve got a report to finish for the office � and it\\'s rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re not thundering, \"said Ron irritably. \"We\\'re walking. Sorry if we\\'ve\\n\\ndisturbed the top�secret workings of the Ministry of Magic.\"\\n\\n\"What are you working on?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation,\" said Percy smugly. \"We\\'re trying to standardize cauldron thickness. Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin � leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year �\"\\n\\n\"That\\'ll change the world, that report will,\" said Ron. \"Front page of the Daily Prophet, I expect, cauldron leaks.\"\\n\\nPercy went slightly pink.\\n\\n\"You might sneer, Ron,\" he said heatedly, \"but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow� bottomed products that seriously endanger �\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, yeah, all right,\" said Ron, and he started off upstairs again. Percy slammed his bedroom door shut. As Harry, Hermione, and Ginny followed Ron up three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them. It sounded as though Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Weasley about the toffees.\\n\\nThe room at the top of the house where Ron slept looked much as it had the last time that Harry had come to stay: the same posters of Ron\\'s favorite Quidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the fish tank on the windowsill, which had previously held frog spawn, now contained one extremely large frog. Ron\\'s old rat, Scabbers, was here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered Ron\\'s letter to Harry in Privet Drive. It was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madly.\\n\\n\"Shut up, Pig,\" said Ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room. \"Fred and George are in here with us, because Bill and Charlie are in their room,\" he told Harry. \"Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he\\'s got to work.\"\\n\\n\"Er � why are you calling that owl Pig?\" Harry asked Ron.\\n\\n\"Because he\\'s being stupid,\" said Ginny, \"Its proper name is Pigwidgeon.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, and that\\'s not a stupid name at all,\" said Ron sarcastically. \"Ginny named him,\" he explained to Harry. \"She reckons it\\'s sweet. And I tried to change it, but it was too late, he won\\'t answer to anything else. So now he\\'s Pig. I\\'ve got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes. He annoys me too, come to that.\\n\\nPigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting shrilly. Harry knew Ron too well to take him seriously. He had moaned continually about his old rat, Scabbers, but had been most upset when Hermione\\'s cat, Crookshanks, appeared to have\\n\\neaten him.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Crookshanks?\" Harry asked Hermione now.\\n\\n\"Out in the garden, I expect,\" she said. \"He likes chasing gnomes. He\\'s never seen any before.\"\\n\\n\"Percy\\'s enjoying work, then?\" said Harry, sitting down on one of the beds and watching the Chudley Cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the ceiling.\\n\\n\"Enjoying it?\" said Ron darkly. \"I don\\'t reckon he\\'d come home if Dad didn\\'t make him. He\\'s obsessed. Just don\\'t get him onto the subject of his boss. According to Mr. Crouch ... as I was saying to Mr. Crouch ... Mr. Crouch is of the opinion ...\\n\\nMr. Crouch was telling me ... They\\'ll be announcing their engagement any day now.\"\\n\\n\"Have you had a good summer, Harry?\" said Hermione. \"Did you get our food parcels and everything?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, thanks a lot, \" said Harry. \"They saved my life, those cakes.\\n\\n\"And have you heard from �?\" Ron began, but at a look from Hermione he fell silent. Harry knew Ron had been about to ask about Sirius. Ron and Hermione had been so deeply involved in helping Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they were almost as concerned about Harry\\'s godfather as he was. However, discussing him in front of Ginny was a bad idea. Nobody but themselves and Professor Dumbledore knew about how Sirius had escaped, or believed in his innocence.\\n\\n\"I think they\\'ve stopped arguing,\" said Hermione, to cover the awkward moment, because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron to Harry. \"Shall we go down and help your mum with dinner?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, all right,\" said Ron. The four of them left Ron\\'s room and went back downstairs to find Mrs. Weasley alone in the kitchen, looking extremely bad� tempered.\\n\\n\"We\\'re eating out in the garden,\" she said when they came in. \"There\\'s just not room for eleven people in here. Could you take the plates outside, girls? Bill and Charlie are setting up the tables. Knives and forks, please, you two,\" she said to Ron and Harry, pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off the walls and ceiling.\\n\\n\"Oh for heaven\\'s sake,\" she snapped, now directing her wand at a dustpan, which hopped off the sideboard and started skating across the floor, scooping up the potatoes. \"Those two!\" she burst out savagely, now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard, and Harry knew she meant Fred and George. I don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen to them, I really don\\'t. No ambition, unless you count making as much\\n\\ntrouble as they possibly can....\"\\n\\nMrs. Weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it. A creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirred.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not as though they haven\\'t got brains, she continued irritably, taking the saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand, \"but they\\'re wasting them, and unless they pull themselves together soon, they\\'ll be in real trouble. I\\'ve had more owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put together. If they carry on the way they\\'re going, they\\'ll end up in front of the Improper Use of Magic Office.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer, which shot open. Harry and Ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it, flew across the kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know where we went wrong with them,\" said Mrs. Weasley, putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans. \"It\\'s been the same for years, one thing after another, and they won\\'t listen to � OH NOT AGAIN!\"\\n\\nShe had picked up her wand from the table, and it had emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse.\\n\\n\"One of their fake wands again!\" she shouted. \"How many times have I told them not to leave them lying around?\"\\n\\nShe grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the stove was smoking.\\n\\n\"C\\'mon,\" Ron said hurriedly to Harry, seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer, \"let\\'s go and help Bill and Charlie.\"\\n\\nThey left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door into the yard.\\n\\nThey had only gone a few paces when Hermione\\'s bandy�legged ginger cat, Crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottle�brush tail held high in the air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs. Harry recognized it instantly as a gnome. Barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the Wellington boots that lay scattered around the door. Harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to reach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house. The source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden, and saw that Bill and Charlie both had their wands out, and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each other, each attempting to knock the other\\'s out of the air. Fred and George were cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiety.\\n\\nBill\\'s table caught Charlie\\'s with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs off.\\n\\nThere was a clatter from overhead, and they all looked up to see Percy\\'s head poking out of a window on the second floor.\\n\\n\"Will you keep it down?!\" he bellowed.\\n\\n\"Sorry, Perce,\" said Bill, grinning. \"How\\'re the cauldron bottoms coming on?\"\\n\\n\"Very badly,\" said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the window shut. Chuckling, Bill and Charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass, end to end, and then, with a flick of his wand, Bill reattached the table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhere.\\n\\nBy seven o\\'clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of Mrs.\\n\\nWeasley\\'s excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deep�blue sky. To somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was paradise, and at first, Harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to chicken and ham pie, boiled potatoes, and salad.\\n\\nAt the far end of the table, Percy was telling his father all about his report on cauldron bottoms.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve told Mr. Crouch that I\\'ll have it ready by Tuesday,\" Percy was saying pompously. \"That\\'s a bit sooner than he expected it, but I like to keep on top of things. I think he\\'ll be grateful I\\'ve done it in good time, I mean, its extremely busy in our department just now, what with all the arrangements for the World Cup.\\n\\nWe\\'re just not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical Games and Sports. Ludo Bagman �\"\\n\\n\"I like Ludo,\" said Mr. Weasley mildly. \"He was the one who got us such good tickets for the Cup. I did him a bit of a favor: His brother, Otto, got into a spot of trouble � a lawnmower with unnatural powers � I smoothed the whole thing over.\"\\n\\n\"Oh Bagman\\'s likable enough, of course,\" said Percy dismissively, \"but how he ever got to be Head of Department ... when I compare him to Mr. Crouch! I can\\'t see Mr. Crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out what\\'s happened to them. You realize Bertha Jorkins has been missing for over a month now? Went on holiday to Albania and never came back?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I was asking Ludo about that,\" said Mr. Weasley, frowning. \"He says Bertha\\'s gotten lost plenty of times before now � though must say, if it was someone in my department, I\\'d be worried. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Oh Bertha\\'s hopeless, all right,\" said Percy. \"I hear she\\'s been shunted from department to department for years, much more trouble than she\\'s worth ... but all the same, Bagman ought to be trying to find her. Mr. Crouch has been taking a personal interest, she worked in our department at one time, you know, and I think Mr. Crouch was quite fond of her � but Bagman just keeps laughing and saying she\\n\\nprobably misread the map and ended up in Australia instead of Albania. However\"\\n\\n� Percy heaved an impressive sigh and took a deep swig of elderflower wine � \"we\\'ve got quite enough on our plates at the Department of International Magical Cooperation without trying to find members of other departments too. As you know, we\\'ve got another big event to organize right after the World Cup.\"\\n\\nPercy cleared his throat significantly and looked down toward the end of the table where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sitting. \"You know the one I\\'m talking about, Father.\" He raised his voice slightly. \"The top�secret one.\"\\n\\nRon rolled his eyes and muttered to Harry and Hermione, \"He\\'s been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work. Probably an exhibition of thick�bottomed cauldrons.\"\\n\\nIn the middle of the table, Mrs. Weasley was arguing with Bill about his earring, which seemed to be a recent acquisition.\\n\\n\". . . with a horrible great fang on it. Really, Bill, what do they say at the bank?\"\\n\\n\"Mum,.no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring home plenty of treasure,\" said Bill patiently.\\n\\n\"And your hair\\'s getting silly, dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley, fingering her wand lovingly.\" I wish you\\'d let me give it a trim. . . .\"\\n\\n\"I like it,\" said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill. \"You\\'re so old�fashioned, Mum. Anyway, it\\'s nowhere near as long as Professor Dumbledore\\'s....\"\\n\\nNext to Mrs. Weasley, Fred, George, and Charlie were all talking spiritedly about the World Cup.\\n\\n\"It\\'s got to be Ireland,\" said Charlie thickly, through a mouthful of potato. \"They flattened Peru in the semifinals.\"\\n\\n\"Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum, though,\" said Fred.\\n\\n\"Krum\\'s one decent player, Ireland has got seven,\" said Charlie shortly. \"I wish England had got through. That was embarrassing, that was.\"\\n\\n\"What happened?\" said Harry eagerly, regretting more than ever his isolation from the wizarding world when he was stuck on Privet Drive.\\n\\n\"Went down to Transylvania, three hundred and ninety to ten,\" said Charlie gloomily. \"Shocking performance. And Wales lost to Uganda, and Scotland was slaughtered by Luxembourg.\"\\n\\nHarry had been on the Gryffindor House Quidditch team ever since his first year at Hogwarts and owned one of the best racing brooms in the world, a Firebolt. Flying came more naturally to Harry than anything else in the magical world, and he played in the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor House team.\\n\\nMr. Weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had their homemade strawberry ice cream, and by the time they had finished, moths were fluttering low over the table, and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle. Harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes, laughing madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks.\\n\\nRon looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy talking, then he said very quietly to Harry, \"So � have you heard from Sirius lately?\"\\n\\nHermione looked around, listening closely.\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry softly, \"twice. He sounds okay. I wrote to him yesterday. He might write back while I\\'m here.\"\\n\\nHe suddenly remembered the reason he had written to Sirius, and for a moment was on the verge of telling Ron and Hermione about his scar hurting again, and about the dream that had awoken him ... but he really didn\\'t want to worry them just now, not when he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful.\\n\\n\"Look at the time,\" Mrs. Weasley said suddenly, checking her wristwatch. \"You really should be in bed, the whole lot of you you\\'ll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup. Harry, if you leave your school list out, I\\'ll get your things for you tomorrow in Diagon Alley. I\\'m getting everyone else\\'s. There might not be time after the World Cup, the match went on for five days last time.\"\\n\\n\"Wow � hope it does this time!\" said Harry enthusiastically.\\n\\n\"Well, I certainly don\\'t,\" said Percy sanctimoniously. \"I shudder to think what the state of my in�tray would be if I was away from work for five days.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, someone might slip dragon dung in it again, eh, Perce?\" said Fred.\\n\\n\"That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway!\" said Percy, going very red in the face. \"It was nothing personal!\"\\n\\n\"It was,\" Fred whispered to Harry as they got up from the table. \"We sent it.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER SIX � THE PORTKEY\\n\\nHarry felt as though he had barely lain down to steep in Ron\\'s room when he was being shaken awake by Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\n\"Time to go, Harry, dear,\" she whispered, moving away to wake Ron.\\n\\nHarry felt around for his glasses, put them on, and sat up. It was still dark outside.\\n\\nRon muttered indistinctly as his mother roused him. At the foot of Harry\\'s mattress he saw two large, disheveled shapes emerging from tangles of blankets.\\n\\n\"\\'S\\' time already?\" said Fred groggily.\\n\\nThey dressed in silence, too sleepy to talk, then, yawning and stretching, the four of them headed downstairs into the kitchen.\\n\\nMrs. Weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot on the stove, while Mr.\\n\\nWeasley was sitting at the table, checking a sheaf of large parchment tickets. He looked up as the boys entered and spread his arms so that they could see his clothes more clearly. He was wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater and a very old pair of jeans, slightly too big for him and held up with a thick leather belt.\\n\\n\"What d\\'you think?\" he asked anxiously. \"We\\'re supposed to go incognito � do I look like a Muggle, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, smiling, \"very good.\"\\n\\n\"Where\\'re Bill and Charlie and Per�Per�Percy?\" said George, failing to stifle a huge yawn.\\n\\n\"Well, they\\'re Apparating, aren\\'t they?\" said Mrs. Weasley, heaving the large pot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into bowls. \"So they can have a bit of a lie�in.\"\\n\\nHarry knew that Apparating meant disappearing from one place and reappearing almost instantly in another, but had never known any Hogwarts student to do it, and understood that it was very difficult.\\n\\n\"So they\\'re still in bed?\" said Fred grumpily, pulling his bowl of porridge toward him. \"Why can\\'t we Apparate too?\"\\n\\n\"Because you\\'re not of age and you haven\\'t passed your test,\" snapped Mrs.\\n\\nWeasley. \"And where have those girls got to?\"\\n\\nShe bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the stairs.\\n\\n\"You have to pass a test to Apparate?\" Harry asked.\\n\\n\"Oh yes,\" said Mr. Weasley, tucking the tickets safely into the back pocket of his jeans. \"The Department of Magical Transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for Apparating without a license. It\\'s not easy, Apparition, and when it\\'s not done property it can lead to nasty complications. This pair I\\'m talking about went and splinched themselves.\"\\n\\nEveryone around the table except Harry winced.\\n\\n\"Er � splinched?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"They left half of themselves behind,\" said Mr. Weasley, now spooning large amounts of treacle onto his porridge. \"So, of course, they were stuck. Couldn\\'t move either way. Had to wait for the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to sort them out. Meant a fair old bit of paperwork, I can tell you, what with the Muggles who spotted the body parts they\\'d left behind.....\"\\n\\nHarry had a sudden vision of a pair of legs and an eyeball lying abandoned on the pavement of Privet Drive.\\n\\n\"Were they okay?\" he asked, startled.\\n\\n\"Oh yes,\" said Mr. Weasley matter�of�factly. \"But they got a heavy fine, and I don\\'t think they\\'ll be trying it again in a hurry. You don\\'t mess around with Apparition. There are plenty of adult wizards who don\\'t bother with it. Prefer brooms � slower, but safer.\"\\n\\n\"But Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it?\"\\n\\n\"Charlie had to take the test twice,\" said Fred, grinning. \"He failed the first time.\\n\\nApparated five miles south of where he meant to, right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping, remember?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, well, he passed the second time,\" said Mrs. Weasley, marching back into the kitchen amid hearty sniggers.\\n\\n\"Percy only passed two weeks ago,\" said George. \"He\\'s been Apparating downstairs every morning since, just to prove he can.\"\\n\\nThere were footsteps down the passageway and Hermione and Ginny came into the kitchen, both looking pale and drowsy.\\n\\n\"Why do we have to be up so early?\" Ginny said, rubbing her eyes and sitting down at the table.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got a bit of a walk,\" said Mr. Weasley.\\n\\n\"Walk?\" said Harry. \"What, are we walking to the World Cup?\"\\n\\n\"No, no, that\\'s miles away,\" said Mr. Weasley, smiling. \"We only need to walk a short way. It\\'s just that it\\'s very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting Muggle attention. We have to be very careful about\\n\\nhow we travel at the best of times, and on a huge occasion like the Quidditch World Cup...\"\\n\\n\"George!\" said Mrs. Weasley sharply, and they all jumped.\\n\\n\"What?\" said George, in an innocent tone that deceived nobody.\\n\\n\"What is that in your pocket?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you lie to me!\"\\n\\nMrs. Weasley pointed her wand at George\\'s pocket and said, \"Accio!\"\\n\\nSeveral small, brightly colored objects zoomed out of George\\'s pocket; he made a grab for them but missed, and they sped right into Mrs. Weasley\\'s outstretched hand.\\n\\n\"We told you to destroy them!\" said Mrs. Weasley furiously, holding up what were unmistakably more Ton�Tongue Toffees. \"We told you to get rid of the lot!\\n\\nEmpty your pockets, go on, both of you!\"\\n\\nIt was an unpleasant scene; the twins had evidently been trying to smuggle as many toffees out of the house as possible, and it was only by using her Summoning Charm that Mrs. Weasley managed to find them all.\\n\\n\"Accio! Accio! Accio!\" she shouted, and toffees zoomed from all sorts of unlikely places, including the lining of George\\'s jacket and the turn�ups of Fred\\'s jeans.\\n\\n\"We spent six months developing those!\" Fred shouted at his mother as she threw the toffees away.\\n\\n\"Oh a fine way to spend six months!\" she shrieked. \"No wonder you didn\\'t get more O.W.L.s!\"\\n\\nAll in all, the atmosphere was not very friendly as they took their departure. Mrs.\\n\\nWeasley was still glowering as she kissed Mr. Weasley on the cheek, though not nearly as much as the twins, who had each hoisted their rucksacks onto their backs and walked out without a word to her.\\n\\n\"Well, have a lovely time,\" said Mrs. Weasley, \"and behave yourselves,\" she called after the twins\\' retreating backs, but they did not look back or answer. \"I\\'ll send Bill, Charlie, and Percy along around midday,\" Mrs. Weasley said to Mr.\\n\\nWeasley, as he, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny set off across the dark yard after Fred and George.\\n\\nIt was chilly and the moon was still out. Only a dull, greenish tinge along the horizon to their right showed that daybreak was drawing closer. Harry, having been thinking about thousands of wizards speeding toward the Quidditch World Cup, sped up to walk with Mr. Weasley.\\n\\n\"So how does everyone get there without all the Muggles noticing?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"It\\'s been a massive organizational problem,\" sighed Mr. Weasley. \"The trouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the World Cup, and of course, we just haven\\'t got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all. There are places Muggles can\\'t penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three�quarters. So we had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many anti�Muggle precautions as possible. The whole Ministry\\'s been working on it for months. First, of course, we have to stagger the arrivals. People with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand. A limited number use Muggle transport, but we can\\'t have too many clogging up their buses and trains � remember, wizards are coming from all over the world.\\n\\nSome Apparate, of course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well away from Muggles. I believe there\\'s a handy wood they\\'re using as the Apparition point. For those who don\\'t want to Apparate, or can\\'t, we use Portkeys.\\n\\nThey\\'re objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time. You can do large groups at a time if you need to. There have been two hundred Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain, and the nearest one to us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill, so that\\'s where we\\'re headed.\"\\n\\nMr. Weasley pointed ahead of them, where a large black mass rose beyond the village of Ottery St. Catchpole.\\n\\n\"What sort of objects are Portkeys?\" said Harry curiously.\\n\\n\"Well, they can be anything,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Unobtrusive things, obviously, so Muggles don\\'t go picking them up and playing with them ... stuff they\\'ll just think is litter....\"\\n\\nThey trudged down the dark, dank lane toward the village, the silence broken only by their footsteps. The sky lightened very slowly as they made their way through the village, its inky blackness diluting to deepest blue. Harry\\'s hands and feet were freezing. Mr. Weasley kept checking his watch.\\n\\nThey didn\\'t have breath to spare for talking as they began to climb Stoatshead Hill, stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit holes, slipping on thick black tuffets of grass. Each breath Harry took was sharp in his chest and his legs were starting to seize up when, at last, his feet found level ground.\\n\\n\"Whew,\" panted Mr. Weasley, taking off his glasses and wiping them on his sweater. \"Well, we\\'ve made good time � we\\'ve got ten minutes.\"\\n\\nHermione came over the crest of the hill last, clutching a stitch in her side.\\n\\n\"Now we just need the Portkey,\" said Mr. Weasley, replacing his glasses and squinting around at the ground. \"It won\\'t be big.... Come on...\"\\n\\nThey spread out, searching. They had only been at it for a couple of minutes, however, when a shout rent the still air.\\n\\n\"Over here, Arthur! Over here, son, we\\'ve got it.\"\\n\\nTwo tall figures were silhouetted against the starry sky on the other side of the hilltop.\\n\\n\"Amos!\" said Mr. Weasley, smiling as he strode over to the man who had shouted.\\n\\nThe rest of them followed.\\n\\nMr. Weasley was shaking hands with a ruddy�faced wizard with a scrubby brown beard, who was holding a moldy�looking old boot in his other hand.\\n\\n\"This is Amos Diggory, everyone,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"He works for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. And I think you know his son, Cedric?\"\\n\\nCedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen. He was Captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff House Quidditch team at Hogwarts.\\n\\n\"Hi,\" said Cedric, looking around at them all.\\n\\nEverybody said hi back except Fred and George, who merely nodded. They had never quite forgiven Cedric for beating their team, Gryffindor, in the first Quidditch match of the previous year.\\n\\n\"Long walk, Arthur?\" Cedric\\'s father asked. \"Not too bad,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"We live just on the other side of the village there. You?\"\\n\\n\"Had to get up at two, didn\\'t we, Ced? I tell you, I\\'ll be glad when he\\'s got his Apparition test. Still ... not complaining ... Quidditch World Cup, wouldn\\'t miss it for a sackful of Galleons � and the tickets cost about that. Mind you, looks like I got off easy. . . .\" Amos Diggory peered good�naturedly around at the three Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny. \"All these yours, Arthur?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no, only the redheads,\" said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his children. \"This is Hermione, friend of Ron\\'s � and Harry, another friend �\"\\n\\n\"Merlin\\'s beard,\" said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening. \"Harry? Harry Potter?\"\\n\\n\"Er � yeah,\" said Harry.\\n\\nHarry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him, used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it always made him feel uncomfortable.\\n\\n\"Ced\\'s talked about you, of course,\" said Amos Diggory. \"Told us all about playing against you last year... I said to him, I said � Ced, that\\'ll be something to tell your grandchildren, that will.... You beat Harry Potter!\"\\n\\nHarry couldn\\'t think of any reply to this, so he remained silent. Fred and George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.\\n\\n\"Harry fell off his broom, Dad,\" he muttered. I told you ... it was an accident....\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but you didn\\'t fall off, did you?\" roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back. \"Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman ... but the best man won, I\\'m sure Harry\\'d say the same, wouldn\\'t you, eh? One falls off his broom, one stays on, you don\\'t need to be a genius to tell which one\\'s the better flier!\"\\n\\n\"Must be nearly time,\" said Mr. Weasley quickly, pulling out his watch again. \"Do you know whether we\\'re waiting for any more, Amos?\"\\n\\n\"No, the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the Fawcetts couldn\\'t get tickets,\" said Mr. Diggory. \"There aren\\'t any more of us in this area, are there?\"\\n\\n\"Not that I know of,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Yes, it\\'s a minute off ... We\\'d better get ready....\"\\n\\nHe looked around at Harry and Hermione.\\n\\n\"You just need to touch the Portkey, that\\'s all, a finger will do �\"\\n\\nWith difficulty, owing to their bulky backpacks, the nine of them crowded around the old boot held out by Amos Diggory.\\n\\nThey all stood there, in a tight circle, as a chill breeze swept over the hilltop.\\n\\nNobody spoke. It suddenly occurred to Harry how odd this would look if a Muggle were to walk up here now ... nine people, two of them grown men, clutching this manky old boot in the semidarkness, waiting....\\n\\n\"Three. . .\" muttered Mr. Weasley, one eye still on his watch, two. . . one. . .\"\\n\\nIt happened immediately: Harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward. His feet left the ground; he could feel Ron and Hermione on either side of him, their shoulders banging into his; they were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color; his forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then � His feet slammed into the ground; Ron staggered into him and he fell over; the Portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thud.\\n\\nHarry looked up. Mr. Weasley, Mr. Diggory, and Cedric were still standing, though looking very windswept; everybody else was on the ground.\\n\\n\"Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill,\" said a voice.\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVEN � BAGMAN AND CROUCH\\n\\nHarry disentangled himself from Ron and got to his feet. They had arrived on what appeared to be a deserted stretch of misty moor. In front of them was a pair of tired and grumpy�looking wizards, one of whom was holding a large gold watch, the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill. Both were dressed as Muggles, though very inexpertly: The man with the watch wore a tweed suit with thigh� length galoshes; his colleague, a kilt and a poncho.\\n\\n\"Morning, Basil,\" said Mr. Weasley, picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard, who threw it into a large box of used Portkeys beside him; Harry could see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can, and a punctured football.\\n\\n\"Hello there, Arthur,\" said Basil wearily. \"Not on duty, eh? It\\'s all right for some.... We\\'ve been here all night.... You\\'d better get out of the way, we\\'ve got a big party coming in from the Black Forest at five fifteen. Hang on, I\\'ll find your campsite.... Weasley ... Weasley....\" He consulted his parchment list. \"About a quarter of a mile\\'s walk over there, first field you come to. Site manager\\'s called Mr. Roberts. Diggory ... second field ... ask for Mr. Payne.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks, Basil,\" said Mr. Weasley, and he beckoned everyone to follow him.\\n\\nThey set off across the deserted moor, unable to make out much through the mist.\\n\\nAfter about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view.\\n\\nBeyond it, Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon. They said good�bye to the Diggorys and approached the cottage door.\\n\\nA man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents. Harry knew at a glance that this was the only real Muggle for several acres. When he heard their footsteps, he turned his head to look at them.\\n\\n\"Morning!\" said Mr. Weasley brightly.\\n\\n\"Morning,\" said the Muggle.\\n\\n\"Would you be Mr. Roberts?\"\\n\\n\"Aye, I would,\" said Mr. Roberts. \"And who\\'re you?\"\\n\\n\"Weasley � two tents, booked a couple of days ago?\"\\n\\n\"Aye,\" said Mr. Roberts, consulting a list tacked to the door. \"You\\'ve got a space up by the wood there. Just the one night?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s it,\" said Mr. Weasley.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll be paying now, then?\" said Mr. Roberts.\\n\\n\"Ah � right � certainly �\" said Mr. Weasley. He retreated a short distance from the cottage and beckoned Harry toward him. \"Help me, Harry,\" he muttered, pulling a roll of Muggle money from his pocket and starting to peel the notes apart. \"This one\\'s a � a � a ten? Ah yes, I see the little number on it now... So this is a five?\"\\n\\n\"A twenty,\" Harry corrected him in an undertone, uncomfortably aware of Mr.\\n\\nRoberts trying to catch every word.\\n\\n\"Ah yes, so it is.... I don\\'t know, these little bits of paper...\"\\n\\n\"You foreign?\" said Mr. Roberts as Mr. Weasley returned with the correct notes.\\n\\n\"Foreign?\" repeated Mr. Weasley, puzzled.\\n\\n\"You\\'re not the first one who\\'s had trouble with money,\" said Mr. Roberts, scrutinizing Mr. Weasley closely. \"I had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago.\"\\n\\n\"Did you really?\" said Mr. Weasley nervously.\\n\\nMr. Roberts rummaged around in a tin for some change.\\n\\n\"Never been this crowded,\" he said suddenly, looking out over the misty field again. \"Hundreds of pre�bookings. People usually just turn up....\"\\n\\n\"Is that right?\" said Mr. Weasley, his hand held out for his change, but Mr.\\n\\nRoberts didn\\'t give it to him.\\n\\n\"Aye,\" he said thoughtfully. \"People from all over. Loads of foreigners. And not just foreigners. Weirdos, you know? There\\'s a bloke walking \\'round in a kilt and a poncho.\"\\n\\n\"Shouldn\\'t he?\" said Mr. Weasley anxiously \"It\\'s like some sort of... I dunno ... like some sort of rally,\" said Mr. Roberts. \"They all seem to know each other. Like a big party.\"\\n\\nAt that moment, a wizard in plus�fours appeared out of thin air next to Mr.\\n\\nRoberts\\'s front door.\\n\\n\"Obliviate!\" he said sharply, pointing his wand at Mr. Roberts.\\n\\nInstantly, Mr. Roberts\\'s eyes slid out of focus, his brows unknitted, and a took of dreamy unconcern fell over his face. Harry recognized the symptoms of one who had just had his memory modified.\\n\\n\"A map of the campsite for you,\" Mr. Roberts said placidly to Mr. Weasley. \"And your change.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks very much,\" said Mr. Weasley.\\n\\nThe wizard in plus�fours accompanied them toward the gate to the campsite. He\\n\\nlooked exhausted: His chin was blue with stubble and there were deep purple shadows under his eyes. Once out of earshot of Mr. Roberts, he muttered to Mr.\\n\\nWeasley, \"Been having a lot of trouble with him. Needs a Memory Charm ten times a day to keep him happy. And Ludo Bagman\\'s not helping. Trotting around talking about Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his voice, not a worry about anti� Muggle security Blimey, I\\'ll be glad when this is over. See you later, Arthur.\"\\n\\nHe Disapparated.\\n\\n\"I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports,\" said Ginny, looking surprised. \"He should know better than to talk about Bludgers near Muggles, shouldn\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\"He should,\" said Mr. Weasley, smiling, and leading them through the gates into the campsite, \"but Ludo\\'s always been a bit ... well . . . lax about security. You couldn\\'t wish for a more enthusiastic head of the sports department though. He played Quidditch for England himself, you know. And he was the best Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had.\"\\n\\nThey trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents. Most looked almost ordinary; their owners had clearly tried to make them as Muggle�like as possible, but had slipped up by adding chimneys, or bellpulls, or weather vanes. However, here and there was a tent so obviously magical that Harry could hardly be surprised that Mr. Roberts was getting suspicious. Halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace, with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance. A little farther on they passed a tent that had three floors and several turrets; and a short way beyond that was a tent that had a front garden attached, complete with birdbath, sundial, and fountain.\\n\\n\"Always the same,\" said Mr. Weasley, smiling. \"We can\\'t resist showing off when we get together. Ah, here we are, look, this is us.\"\\n\\nThey had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field, and here was an empty space, with a small sign hammered into the ground that read WEEZLY.\\n\\n\"Couldn\\'t have a better spot!\" said Mr. Weasley happily. \"The field is just on the other side of the wood there, we\\'re as close as we could be.\" He hoisted his backpack from his shoulders. \"Right,\" he said excitedly, \"no magic allowed, strictly speaking, not when we\\'re out in these numbers on Muggle land. We\\'ll be putting these tents up by hand! Shouldn\\'t be too difficult.... Muggles do it all the time.... Here, Harry, where do you reckon we should start?\"\\n\\nHarry had never been camping in his life; the Dursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday, preferring to leave him with Mrs. Figg, an old neighbor.\\n\\nHowever, he and Hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs should go, and though Mr. Weasley was more of a hindrance than a help, because he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet, they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby two�man tents.\\n\\nAll of them stood back to admire their handiwork. Nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards, Harry thought, but the trouble was that once Bill, Charlie, and Percy arrived, they would be a party of ten. Hermione seemed to have spotted this problem too; she gave Harry a quizzical look as Mr.\\n\\nWeasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll be a bit cramped,\" he called, \"but I think we\\'ll all squeeze in. Come and have a look.\"\\n\\nHarry bent down, ducked under the tent flap, and felt his jaw drop. He had walked into what looked like an old�fashioned, three room flat, complete with bathroom and kitchen. Oddly enough, it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as Mrs. Figg\\'s house: There were crocheted covers on the mismatched chairs and a strong smell of cats.\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s not for long,\" said Mr. Weasley, mopping his bald patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom. I borrowed this from Perkins at the office. Doesn\\'t camp much anymore, poor fellow, he\\'s got lumbago.\"\\n\\nHe picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it. \"We\\'ll need water....\\n\\n\"There\\'s a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave us,\" said Ron, who had followed Harry inside the tent and seemed completely unimpressed by its extraordinary inner proportions. \"It\\'s on the other side of the field.\"\\n\\n\"Well, why don\\'t you, Harry, and Hermione go and get us some water then\" � Mr.\\n\\nWeasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans � \"and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire?\"\\n\\n\"But we\\'ve got an oven,\" said Ron. \"Why can\\'t we just �\"\\n\\n\"Ron, anti�Muggle security!\" said Mr. Weasley, his face shining with anticipation.\\n\\n\"When real Muggles camp, they cook on fires outdoors. I\\'ve seen them at it!\"\\n\\nAfter a quick tour of the girls\\' tent, which was slightly smaller than the boys\\', though without the smell of cats, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off across the campsite with the kettle and saucepans.\\n\\nNow, with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting, they could see the city of tents that stretched in every direction. They made their way slowly through the rows, staring eagerly around. It was only just dawning on Harry how many witches and wizards there must be in the world; he had never really thought much about those in other countries.\\n\\nTheir fellow campers were starting to wake up. First to stir were the families with small children; Harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before. A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid�shaped tent, holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling\\n\\nslowly to the size of a salami. As they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent.\\n\\n\"How many times, Kevin? You don\\'t � touch � Daddy\\'s � wand � yecchh! \"\\n\\nShe had trodden on the giant slug, which burst. Her scolding carried after them on the still air, mingling with the little boy\\'s yells � \"You bust slug! You bust slug!\"\\n\\nA short way farther on, they saw two little witches, barely older than Kevin, who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls\\' toes to skim the dewy grass. A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he hurried past Harry, Ron, and Hermione he muttered distractedly, \"In broad daylight! Parents having a lie�in, I suppose �\"\\n\\nHere and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast. Some, with furtive looks around them, conjured fires with their wands; others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces, as though sure this couldn\\'t work. Three African wizards sat in serious conversation, all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a bright purple fire, while a group of middle�aged American witches sat gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between their tents that read: THE SALEM WITCHES\\' INSTITUTE. Harry caught snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed, and though he couldn\\'t understand a word, the tone of every single voice was excited.\\n\\n\"Er � is it my eyes, or has everything gone green?\" said Ron.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t just Ron\\'s eyes. They had walked into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks, so that it looked as though small, oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth. Grinning faces could be seen under those that had their flaps open. Then, from behind them, they heard their names.\\n\\n\"Harry! Ron! Hermione!\"\\n\\nIt was Seamus Finnigan, their fellow Gryffindor fourth year. He was sitting in front of his own shamrock�covered tent, with a sandy�haired woman who had to be his mother, and his best friend, Dean Thomas, also of Gryffindor.\\n\\n\"Like the decorations?\" said Seamus, grinning. \"The Ministry\\'s not too happy.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, why shouldn\\'t we show our colors?\" said Mrs. Finnigan. \"You should see what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents. You\\'ll be supporting Ireland, of course?\" she added, eyeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione beadily. When they had assured her that they were indeed supporting Ireland, they set off again, though, as Ron said, \"Like we\\'d say anything else surrounded by that lot.\" I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents?\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s go and have a look,\" said Harry, pointing to a large patch of tents upfield,\\n\\nwhere the Bulgarian flag � white, green, and red � was fluttering in the breeze.\\n\\nThe tents here had not been bedecked with plant life, but each and every one of them had the same poster attached to it, a poster of a very surly face with heavy black eyebrows. The picture was, of course, moving, but all it did was blink and scowl.\\n\\n\"Krum,\" said Ron quietly.\\n\\n\"What?\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"Krum!\" said Ron. \"Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker!\"\\n\\n\"He looks really grumpy,\" said Hermione, looking around at the many Krums blinking and scowling at them.\\n\\n\"\\'Really grumpy?\" Ron raised his eyes to the heavens. \"Who cares what he looks like? He\\'s unbelievable. He\\'s really young too. Only just eighteen or something.\\n\\nHe\\'s a genius, you wait until tonight, you\\'ll see.\"\\n\\nThere was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field. Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument. One of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown. The other was clearly a Ministry wizard; he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation.\\n\\n\"Just put them on, Archie, there\\'s a good chap. You can\\'t walk around like that, the Muggle at the gate\\'s already getting suspicious � I bought this in a Muggle shop,\" said the old wizard stubbornly. \"Muggles wear them.\"\\n\\n\"Muggle women wear them, Archie, not the men, they wear these,\" said the Ministry wizard, and he brandished the pinstriped trousers.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not putting them on,\" said old Archie in indignation. \"I like a healthy breeze \\'round my privates, thanks.\"\\n\\nHermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had collected his water and moved away.\\n\\nWalking more slowly now, because of the weight of the water, they made their way back through the campsite. Here and there, they saw more familiar faces: other Hogwarts students with their families. Oliver Wood, the old captain of Harry\\'s House Quidditch team, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged Harry over to his parents\\' tent to introduce him, and told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team. Next they were hailed by Ernie Macmillan, a Hufflepuff fourth year, and a little farther on they saw Cho Chang, a very pretty girl who played Seeker on the Ravenclaw team. She waved and smiled\\n\\nat Harry, who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as he waved back. More to stop Ron from smirking than anything, Harry hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he had never seen before.\\n\\n\"Who d\\'you reckon they are?\" he said. \"They don\\'t go to Hogwarts, do they?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Spect they go to some foreign school,\" said Ron. \"I know there are others. Never met anyone who went to one, though. Bill had a penfriend at a school in Brazil ...\\n\\nthis was years and years ago ... and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but Mum and Dad couldn\\'t afford it. His penfriend got all offended when he said he wasn\\'t going and sent him a cursed hat. It made his ears shrivel up.\"\\n\\nHarry laughed but didn\\'t voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other wizarding schools. He supposed, now that he saw representatives of so many nationalities in the campsite, that he had been stupid never to realize that Hogwarts couldn\\'t be the only one. He glanced at Hermione, who looked utterly unsurprised by the information. No doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding schools in some book or other.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve been ages,\" said George when they finally got back to the Weasleys\\' tents.\\n\\n\"Met a few people,\" said Ron, setting the water down. \"You\\'ve not got that fire started yet?\"\\n\\n\"Dad\\'s having fun with the matches,\" said Fred.\\n\\nMr. Weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire, but it wasn\\'t for lack of trying. Splintered matches littered the ground around him, but he looked as though he was having the time of his life.\\n\\n\"Oops!\" he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in surprise.\\n\\n\"Come here, Mr. Weasley,\" said Hermione kindly, taking the box from him, and showing him how to do it properly.\\n\\nAt last they got the fire lit, though it was at least another hour before it was hot enough to cook anything. There was plenty to watch while they waited, however.\\n\\nTheir tent seemed to be pitched right alongside a kind of thoroughfare to the field, and Ministry members kept hurrying up and down it, greeting Mr. Weasley cordially as they passed. Mr. Weasley kept up a running commentary, mainly for Harry\\'s and Hermione\\'s benefit; his own children knew too much about the Ministry to be greatly interested.\\n\\n\"That was Cuthbert Mockridge, Head of the Goblin Liaison Office.... Here comes Gilbert Wimple; he\\'s with the Committee on Experimental Charms; he\\'s had those horns for a while now... Hello, Arnie ... Arnold Peasegood, he\\'s an Obliviator � member of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, you know... and that\\'s Bode and Croaker ... they\\'re Unspeakables....\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re what?\"\\n\\n\"From the Department of Mysteries, top secret, no idea what they get up to....\"\\n\\nAt last, the fire was ready, and they had just started cooking eggs and sausages when Bill, Charlie, and Percy came strolling out of the woods toward them.\\n\\n\"Just Apparated, Dad,\" said Percy loudly. \"Ah, excellent, lunch!\"\\n\\nThey were halfway through their plates of eggs and sausages when Mr. Weasley jumped to his feet, waving and grinning at a man who was striding toward them.\\n\\n\"Aha!\" he said. \"The man of the moment! Ludo!\"\\n\\nLudo Bagman was easily the most noticeable person Harry had seen so far, even including old Archie in his flowered nightdress. He was wearing long Quidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of bright yellow and black. An enormous picture of a wasp was splashed across his chest. He had the look of a powerfully built man gone slightly to seed; the robes were stretched tightly across a large belly he surely had not had in the days when he had played Quidditch for England. His nose was squashed (probably broken by a stray Bludger, Harry thought), but his round blue eyes, short blond hair, and rosy complexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboy.\\n\\n\"Ahoy there!\" Bagman called happily. He was walking as though he had springs attached to the balls of his feet and was plainly in a state of wild excitement.\\n\\n\"Arthur, old man,\" he puffed as he reached the campfire, \"what a day, eh? What a day! Could we have asked for more perfect weather? A cloudless night coming ...\\n\\nand hardly a hiccough in the arrangements.... Not much for me to do!\"\\n\\nBehind him, a group of haggard�looking Ministry wizards rushed past, pointing at the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet sparks twenty feet into the air.\\n\\nPercy hurried forward with his hand outstretched. Apparently his disapproval of the way Ludo Bagman ran his department did not prevent him from wanting to make a good impression.\\n\\n\"Ah � yes,\" said Mr. Weasley, grinning, \"this is my son Percy. He\\'s just started at the Ministry � and this is Fred � no, George, sorry � that\\'s Fred � Bill, Charlie, Ron � my daughter, Ginny and Ron\\'s friends, Hermione Granger and Harry Potter.\"\\n\\nBagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard Harry\\'s name, and his eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar on Harry\\'s forehead.\\n\\n\"Everyone,\" Mr. Weasley continued, \"this is Ludo Bagman, you know who he is, it\\'s thanks to him we\\'ve got such good tickets �\"\\n\\nBagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been nothing.\\n\\n\"Fancy a flutter on the match, Arthur?\" he said eagerly, jingling what seemed to be a large amount of gold in the pockets of his yellow�and�black robes. \"I\\'ve already got Roddy Pontner betting me Bulgaria will score first � I offered him nice odds, considering Ireland\\'s front three are the strongest I\\'ve seen in years � and little Agatha Timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a weeklong match.\"\\n\\n\"Oh ... go on then,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Let\\'s see ... a Galleon on Ireland to win?\"\\n\\n\"A Galleon?\" Ludo Bagman looked slightly disappointed, but recovered himself.\\n\\n\"Very well, very well ... any other takers?\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re a bit young to be gambling,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Molly wouldn\\'t like �\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll bet thirty�seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles, three Knuts,\" said Fred as he and George quickly pooled all their money, \"that Ireland wins � but Viktor Krum gets the Snitch. Oh and we\\'ll throw in a fake wand.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish like that,\" Percy hissed, but Bagman didn\\'t seem to think the wand was rubbish at all; on the contrary, his boyish face shone with excitement as he took it from Fred, and when the wand gave a loud squawk and turned into a rubber chicken, Bagman roared with laughter.\\n\\n\"Excellent! I haven\\'t seen one that convincing in years! I\\'d pay five Galleons for that!\"\\n\\nPercy froze in an attitude of stunned disapproval.\\n\\n\"Boys,\" said Mr. Weasley under his breath, \"I don\\'t want you betting.... That\\'s all your savings .... Your mother �\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be a spoilsport, Arthur!\" boomed Ludo Bagman, rattling his pockets excitedly. \"They\\'re old enough to know what they want! You reckon Ireland will win but Krum\\'ll get the Snitch? Not a chance, boys, not a chance.... I\\'ll give you excellent odds on that one .... We\\'ll add five Galleons for the funny wand, then, shall we....\"\\n\\nMr. Weasley looked on helplessly as Ludo Bagman whipped out a notebook and quill and began jotting down the twins\\' names.\\n\\n\"Cheers,\" said George, taking the slip of parchment Bagman handed him and tucking it away into the front of his robes. Bagman turned most cheerfully back to Mr. Weasley.\\n\\n\"Couldn\\'t do me a brew, I suppose? I\\'m keeping an eye out for Barty Crouch. My Bulgarian opposite number\\'s making difficulties, and I can\\'t understand a word he\\'s saying. Barty\\'ll be able to sort it out. He speaks about a hundred and fifty languages.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Crouch?\" said Percy, suddenly abandoning his look of poker�stiff\\n\\ndisapproval and positively writhing with excitement. \"He speaks over two hundred! Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll. . .\"\\n\\n\"Anyone can speak Troll,\" said Fred dismissively. \"All you have to do is point and grunt.\"\\n\\nPercy threw Fred an extremely nasty look and stoked the fire vigorously to bring the kettle back to the boil.\\n\\n\"Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet, Ludo?\" Mr. Weasley asked as Bagman settled himself down on the grass beside them all.\\n\\n\"Not a dicky bird,\" said Bagman comfortably. \"But she\\'ll turn up. Poor old Bertha ... memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction. Lost, you take my word for it. She\\'ll wander back into the office sometime in October, thinking it\\'s still July.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t think it might be time to send someone to look for her?\" Mr. Weasley suggested tentatively as Percy handed Bagman his tea.\\n\\n\"Barty Crouch keeps saying that,\" said Bagman, his round eyes widening innocently, \"but we really can\\'t spare anyone at the moment. Oh � talk of the devil!\\n\\nBarty!\"\\n\\nA wizard had just Apparated at their fireside, and he could not have made more of a contrast with Ludo Bagman, sprawled on the grass in his old Wasp robes. Barty Crouch was a stiff, upright, elderly man, dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie. The parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight, and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a slide rule. His shoes were very highly polished. Harry could see at once why Percy idolized him.\\n\\nPercy was a great believer in rigidly following rules, and Mr. Crouch had complied with the rule about Muggle dressing so thoroughly that he could have passed for a bank manager; Harry doubted even Uncle Vernon would have spotted him for what he really was.\\n\\n\"Pull up a bit of grass, Barry,\" said Ludo brightly, patting the ground beside him.\\n\\n\"No thank you, Ludo,\" said Crouch, and there was a bite of impatience in his voice. \"I\\'ve been looking for you everywhere. The Bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the Top Box.\"\\n\\n\"Oh is that what they\\'re after?\" said Bagman. I thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers. Bit of a strong accent.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Crouch!\" said Percy breathlessly, sunk into a kind of halfbow that made him look like a hunchback. \"Would you like a cup of tea?\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Mr. Crouch, looking over at Percy in mild surprise. \"Yes � thank you, Weatherby.\"\\n\\nFred and George choked into their own cups. Percy, very pink around the ears, busied himself with the kettle.\\n\\n\"Oh and I\\'ve been wanting a word with you too, Arthur,\" said Mr. Crouch, his sharp eyes falling upon Mr. Weasley. \"Ali Bashir\\'s on the warpath. He wants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpets.\"\\n\\nMr. Weasley heaved a deep sigh.\\n\\n\"I sent him an owl about that just last week. If I\\'ve told him once I\\'ve told him a hundred times: Carpets are defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects, but will he listen?\"\\n\\n\"I doubt it,\" said Mr. Crouch, accepting a cup from Percy. \"He\\'s desperate to export here.\"\\n\\n\"Well, they\\'ll never replace brooms in Britain, will they?\" said Bagman.\\n\\n\"Ali thinks there\\'s a niche in the market for a family vehicle, said Mr. Crouch. \"I remember my grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve � but that was before carpets were banned, of course.\"\\n\\nHe spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the law.\\n\\n\"So, been keeping busy, Barty?\" said Bagman breezily.\\n\\n\"Fairly,\" said Mr. Crouch dryly. \"Organizing Portkeys across five continents is no mean feat, Ludo.\"\\n\\n\"I expect you\\'ll both be glad when this is over?\" said Mr. Weasley.\\n\\nLudo Bagman looked shocked.\\n\\n\"Glad! Don\\'t know when I\\'ve had more fun.... Still, it\\'s not as though we haven\\'t got anything to took forward to, eh, Barty? Eh? Plenty left to organize, eh?\"\\n\\nMr. Crouch raised his eyebrows at Bagman.\\n\\n\"We agreed not to make the announcement until all the details �\"\\n\\n\"Oh details!\" said Bagman, waving the word away like a cloud of midges.\\n\\n\"They\\'ve signed, haven\\'t they? They\\'ve agreed, haven\\'t they? I bet you anything these kids\\'ll know soon enough anyway. I mean, it\\'s happening at Hogwarts �\"\\n\\n\"Ludo, we need to meet the Bulgarians, you know,\" said Mr. Crouch sharply, cutting Bagman\\'s remarks short. \"Thank you for the tea, Weatherby.\"\\n\\nHe pushed his undrunk tea back at Percy and waited for Ludo to rise; Bagman struggled to his feet, swigging down the last of his tea, the gold in his pockets chinking merrily.\\n\\n\"See you all later!\" he said. \"You\\'ll be up in the Top Box with me � I\\'m commentating!\" He waved, Barty Crouch nodded curtly, and both of them Disapparated.\\n\\n\"What\\'s happening at Hogwarts, Dad?\" said Fred at once. \"What were they talking about?\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll find out soon enough,\" said Mr.Weasley, smiling.\\n\\n\"It\\'s classified information, until such time as the Ministry decides to release it,\"\\n\\nsaid Percy stiffly. \"Mr. Crouch was quite right not to disclose it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh shut up, Weatherby,\" said Fred.\\n\\nA sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the afternoon wore on. By dusk, the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with anticipation, and as darkness spread like a curtain over the thousands of waiting wizards, the last vestiges of pretence disappeared: the Ministry seemed to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now breaking out everywhere.\\n\\nSalesmen were Apparating every few feet, carrying trays and pushing carts full of extraordinary merchandise. There were luminous rosettes � green for Ireland, red for Bulgaria � which were squealing the names of the players, pointed green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks, Bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that really roared, flags from both countries that played their national anthems as they were waved; there were tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves.\\n\\n\"Been saving my pocket money all summer for this,\" Ron told Harry as they and Hermione strolled through the salesmen, buying souvenirs. Though Ron purchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette, he also bought a small figure of Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker. The miniature Krum walked backward and forward over Ron\\'s hand, scowling up at the green rosette above him.\\n\\n\"Wow, look at these!\" said Harry, hurrying over to a cart piled high with what looked like brass binoculars, except that they were covered with all sorts of weird knobs and dials.\\n\\n\"Omnioculars,\" said the saleswizard eagerly. \"You can replay action ... slow everything down ... and they flash up a play�by� play breakdown if you need it.\\n\\nBargain � ten Galleons each.\"\\n\\n\"Wish I hadn\\'t bought this now,\" said Ron, gesturing at his dancing shamrock hat and gazing longingly at the Omnioculars.\\n\\n\"Three pairs,\" said Harry firmly to the wizard.\\n\\n\"No � don\\'t bother,\" said Ron, going red. He was always touchy about the fact that\\n\\nHarry, who had inherited a small fortune from his parents, had much more money than he did.\\n\\n\"You won\\'t be getting anything for Christmas,\" Harry told him, thrusting Omnioculars into his and Hermione\\'s hands. \"For about ten years, mind.\"\\n\\n\"Fair enough,\" said Ron, grinning.\\n\\n\"Oooh, thanks, Harry,\" said Hermione. \"And I\\'ll get us some programs, look �\"\\n\\nTheir money bags considerably lighter, they went back to the tents. Bill, Charlie, and Ginny were all sporting green rosettes too, and Mr. Weasley was carrying an Irish flag. Fred and George had no souvenirs as they had given Bagman all their gold.\\n\\nAnd then a deep, booming gong sounded somewhere beyond the woods, and at once, green and red lanterns blazed into life in the trees, lighting a path to the field.\\n\\n\"It\\'s time!\" said Mr. Weasley, looking as excited as any of them. \"Come on, let\\'s go!\"\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHT � THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP\\n\\nClutching their purchases, Mr. Weasley in the lead, they all hurried into the wood, following the lantern�lit trail. They could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them, shouts and laughter, snatches of singing. The atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious; Harry couldn\\'t stop grinning. They walked through the wood for twenty minutes, talking and joking loudly, until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium. Though Harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field, he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it.\\n\\n\"Seats a hundred thousand,\" said Mr. Weasley, spotting the awestruck look on Harry\\'s face. \"Ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year.\\n\\nMuggle Repelling Charms on every inch of it. Every time Muggles have got anywhere near here all year, they\\'ve suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away again ... bless them,\" he added fondly, leading the way toward the nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards.\\n\\n\"Prime seats!\" said the Ministry witch at the entrance when she checked their tickets. \"Top Box! Straight upstairs, Arthur, and as high as you can go.\"\\n\\nThe stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple. They clambered upward with the rest of the crowd, which slowly filtered away through doors into the stands to their left and right. Mr. Weasley\\'s party kept climbing, and at last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box, set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goal posts. About twenty purple�and�gilt chairs stood in two rows here, and Harry, filing into the front seats with the Weasleys, looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined.\\n\\nA hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats, which rose in levels around the long oval field. Everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light, which seemed to come from the stadium itself. The field looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position. At either end of the field stood three goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite them, almost at Harry\\'s eye level, was a gigantic blackboard. Gold writing kept dashing across it as though an invisible giant\\'s hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again; watching it, Harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the field.\\n\\nThe Bluebottle: A Broom for All the Family � safe, reliable, and with Built�in Anti�Burgler Buzzer ... Mrs. Shower\\'s All Purpose Magical Mess Remover: No Pain, No Stain! ... Gladrags Wizardwear � London, Paris, Hogsmeade...\\n\\nHarry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them. So far it was empty, except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them. The creature, whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair, was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga, and it had its face hidden in its hands. Yet those long, batlike ears were oddly familiar....\\n\\n\"Dobby?\" said Harry incredulously.\\n\\nThe tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers, revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato. It wasn\\'t Dobby � it was, however, unmistakably a house�elf, as Harry\\'s friend Dobby had been. Harry had set Dobby free from his old owners, the Malfoy family.\\n\\n\"Did sir just call me Dobby?\" squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers.\\n\\nIts voice was higher even than Dobby\\'s had been, a teeny, quivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected though it was very hard to tell with a house�elf � that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest.\\n\\n\"Sorry,\" Harry told the elf, \"I just thought you were someone I knew.\"\\n\\n\"But I knows Dobby too, sir!\" squeaked the elf. She was shielding her face, as though blinded by light, though the Top Box was not brightly lit. \"My name is Winky, sir � and you, sir �\" Her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon Harry\\'s scar. \"You is surely Harry Potter!\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I am,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!\" s he said, lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck.\\n\\n\"How is he?\" said Harry. \"How\\'s freedom suiting him?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, sir,\" said Winky, shaking her head, \"ah sir, meaning no disrespect, sir, but I is not sure you did Dobby a favor, sir, when you is setting him free.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\" said Harry, taken aback. \"What\\'s wrong with him?\"\\n\\n\"Freedom is going to Dobby\\'s head, sir, \" said Winky sadly. \"Ideas above his station, sir. Can\\'t get another position, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\" said Harry.\\n\\nWinky lowered her voice by a half�octave and whispered, \"He is wanting paying for his work, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Paying?\" said Harry blankly. \"Well � why shouldn\\'t he be paid?\"\\n\\nWinky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her\\n\\nface was half�hidden again.\\n\\n\"House�elves is not paid, sir!\" she said in a muffled squeak. \"No, no, no. I says to Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby. He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house�elf. You goes racketing around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear you\\'s up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, like some common goblin.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s about time he had a bit of fun,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"House�elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry Potter,\" said Winky firmly, from behind her hands. \"House�elves does what they is told. I is not liking heights at all, Harry Potter\" � she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped � \"but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Why\\'s he sent you up here, if he knows you don\\'t like heights?\" said Harry, frowning.\\n\\n\"Master � master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter. He is very busy,\" said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her. \"Winky is wishing she is back in master\\'s tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does what she is told. Winky is a good house�elf.\"\\n\\nShe gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes completely again. Harry turned back to the others.\\n\\n\"So that\\'s a house�elf?\" Ron muttered. \"Weird things, aren\\'t they?\"\\n\\n\"Dobby was weirder,\" said Harry fervently.\\n\\nRon pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium.\\n\\n\"Wild!\" he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side. I can make that old bloke down there pick his nose again ... and again ... and again. . .\"\\n\\nHermione, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through her velvetcovered, tasseled program.\\n\\n\"\\'A display from the team mascots will precede the match,\"\\' she read aloud.\\n\\n\"Oh that\\'s always worth watching,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"National teams bring creatures from their native land, you know, to put on a bit of a show.\"\\n\\nThe box filled gradually around them over the next half hour. Mr. Weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards. Percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog. When Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself, arrived, Percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered. Highly embarrassed, he\\n\\nrepaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat, throwing jealous looks at Harry, whom Cornelius Fudge had greeted like an old friend. They had met before, and Fudge shook Harry\\'s hand in a fatherly fashion, asked how he was, and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him.\\n\\n\"Harry Potter, you know,\" he told the Bulgarian minister loudly, who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and didn\\'t seem to understand a word of English. \"Harry Potter ... oh come on now, you know who he is ... the boy who survived You�Know�Who ... you do know who he is �\"\\n\\nThe Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry\\'s scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly, pointing at it.\\n\\n\"Knew we\\'d get there in the end,\" said Fudge wearily to Harry. \"I\\'m no great shakes at languages; I need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, I see his house� elf\\'s saving him a seat.... Good job too, these Bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the best places ... ah, and here\\'s Lucius!\"\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly. Edging along the second row to three still�empty seats right behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby the house� elf\\'s former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son, Draco; and a woman Harry supposed must be Draco\\'s mother.\\n\\nHarry and Draco Malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first journey to Hogwarts. A pale boy with a pointed face and white�blond hair, Draco greatly resembled his father. His mother was blonde too; tall and slim, she would have been nice�looking if she hadn\\'t been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose.\\n\\n\"Ah, Fudge,\" said Mr. Malfoy, holding out his hand as he reached the Minister of Magic. \"How are you? I don\\'t think you\\'ve met my wife, Narcissa? Or our son, Draco?\"\\n\\n\"How do you do, how do you do?\" said Fudge, smiling and bowing to Mrs.\\n\\nMalfoy. \"And allow me to introduce you to Mr. Oblansk � Obalonsk � Mr. � well, he\\'s the Bulgarian Minister of Magic, and he can\\'t understand a word I\\'m saying anyway, so never mind. And let\\'s see who else � you know Arthur Weasley, I daresay?\"\\n\\nIt was a tense moment. Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy looked at each other and Harry vividly recalled the last time they had come face�to�face: It had been in Flourish and Blotts\\' bookshop, and they had had a fight. Mr. Malfoy\\'s cold gray eyes swept over Mr. Weasley, and then up and down the row.\\n\\n\"Good lord, Arthur,\" he said softly. \"What did you have to sell to get seats in the Top Box? Surely your house wouldn\\'t have fetched this much?\"\\n\\nFudge, who wasn\\'t listening, said, \"Lucius has just given a very generous contribution to St. Mungo\\'s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Arthur.\\n\\nHe\\'s here as my guest.\"\\n\\n\"How � how nice,\" said Mr. Weasley, with a very strained smile.\\n\\nMr. Malfoy\\'s eyes had returned to Hermione, who went slightly pink, but stared determinedly back at him. Harry knew exactly what was making Mr. Malfoy\\'s lip curl like that. The Malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods; in other words, they considered anyone of Muggle descent, like Hermione, second�class.\\n\\nHowever, under the gaze of the Minister of Magic, Mr. Malfoy didn\\'t dare say anything. He nodded sneeringly to Mr. Weasley and continued down the line to his seats. Draco shot Harry, Ron, and Hermione one contemptuous look, then settled himself between his mother and father.\\n\\n\"Slimy gits,\" Ron muttered as he, Harry, and Hermione turned to face the field again. Next moment, Ludo Bagman charged into the box.\\n\\n\"Everyone ready?\" he said, his round face gleaming like a great, excited Edam.\\n\\n\"Minister � ready to go?\"\\n\\n\"Ready when you are, Ludo,\" said Fudge comfortably.\\n\\nLudo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own throat, and said \"Sonorus!\" and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium; his voice echoed over them, booming into every corner of the stands.\\n\\n\"Ladies and gentlemen. . . welcome! Welcome to the final of the four hundred and twenty�second Quidditch World Cup!\"\\n\\nThe spectators screamed and clapped. Thousands of flags waved, adding their discordant national anthems to the racket. The huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message (Bertie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans � A Risk With Every Mouthful!) and now showed BULGARIA: 0, IRELAND: 0.\\n\\n\"And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce. . . the Bulgarian National Team Mascots!\"\\n\\nThe right�hand side of the stands, which was a solid block of scarlet, roared its approval.\\n\\n\"I wonder what they\\'ve brought,\" said Mr. Weasley, leaning forward in his seat.\\n\\n\"Aaah!\" He suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes. \"Veela!\"\\n\\n\"What are veel �?\"\\n\\nBut a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and Harry\\'s question was answered for him. Veela were women. . . the most beautiful women Harry had ever seen. . . except that they weren\\'t � they couldn\\'t be � human. This puzzled Harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could make their skin shine moon�bright like that, or their white�gold hair fan out behind\\n\\nthem without wind.. . but then the music started, and Harry stopped worrying about them not being human � in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all.\\n\\nThe veela had started to dance, and Harry\\'s mind had gone completely and blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen.\\n\\nAnd as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half�formed thoughts started chasing through Harry\\'s dazed mind. He wanted to do something very impressive, right now. Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea. . . but would it be good enough!\\n\\n\"Harry, what are you doing?\" said Hermione\\'s voice from a long way off.\\n\\nThe music stopped. Harry blinked. He was standing up, and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box. Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard.\\n\\nAngry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn\\'t want the veela to go. Harry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest. Ron, meanwhile, was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat. Mr. Weasley, smiling slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his hands.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll be wanting that,\" he said, \"once Ireland have had their say.\"\\n\\n\"Huh?\" said Ron, staring openmouthed at the veela, who had now lined up along one side of the field.\\n\\nHermione made a loud tutting noise. She reached up and pulled Harry back into his seat. \"Honestly!\" she said.\\n\\n\"And now,\" roared Ludo Bagman\\'s voice, \"kindly put your wands in the air. . . for the Irish National Team Mascots!\"\\n\\nNext moment, what seemed to be a great green�and�gold comet came zooming into the stadium. It did one circuit of the stadium, then split into two smaller comets, each hurtling toward the goal posts. A rainbow arced suddenly across the field, connecting the two balls of light. The crowd oooohed and aaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display. Now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged; they had formed a great shimmering shamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands. Something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it � \"Excellent!\" yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over them, and heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing off their heads and seats.\\n\\nSquinting up at the shamrock, Harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green.\\n\\n\"Leprechauns!\" said Mr. Weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd,\\n\\nmany of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold.\\n\\n\"There you go,\" Ron yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of gold coins into Harry\\'s hand, \"for the Omnioculars! Now you\\'ve got to buy me a Christmas present, ha!\"\\n\\nThe great shamrock dissolved, the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela, and settled themselves cross�legged to watch the match.\\n\\n\"And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome � the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team! I give you � Dimitrov!\"\\n\\nA scarlet�clad figure on a broomstick, moving so fast it was blurred, shot out onto the field from an entrance far below, to wild applause from the Bulgarian supporters.\\n\\n\"Ivanova!\"\\n\\nA second scarlet�robed player zoomed out.\\n\\n\"Zograf! Levski! Vulchanov! Volkov! Aaaaaaand � Krum!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s him, that\\'s him!\" yelled Ron, following Krum with his Omnioculars. Harry quickly focused his own.\\n\\nViktor Krum was thin, dark, and sallow�skinned, with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He looked like an overgrown bird of prey. It was hard to believe he was only eighteen.\\n\\n\"And now, please greet � the Irish National Quidditch Team!\" yelled Bagman.\\n\\n\"Presenting � Connolly! Ryan! Troy! Mullet! Moran! Quigley! Aaaaaand � Lynch!\"\\n\\nSeven green blurs swept onto the field; Harry spun a small dial on the side of his Omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word \"Firebolt\" on each of their brooms and see their names, embroidered in silver, upon their backs.\\n\\n\"And here, all the way from Egypt, our referee, acclaimed Chairwizard of the International Association of Quidditch, Hassan Mostafa!\"\\n\\nA small and skinny wizard, completely bald but with a mustache to rival Uncle Vernon\\'s, wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium, strode out onto the field. A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the other.\\n\\nHarry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open � four balls burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (Harry saw it for the briefest moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch.\\n\\nWith a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the balls.\\n\\n\"Theeeeeeeey\\'re OFF!\" screamed Bagman. \"And it\\'s Mullet! Troy! Moran!\\n\\nDimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy! Levski! Moran!\"\\n\\nIt was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. He was pressing his Omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose. The speed of the players was incredible � the Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names.\\n\\nHarry spun the slow dial on the right of his Omnioculars again, pressed the play� by�play button on the top, and he was immediately watching in slow motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums.\\n\\nHAWKSHEAD ATTACKING FORMATION, he read as he watched the three Irish Chasers zoom closely together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet and Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians. PORSKOFF PLOY flashed up next, as Troy made as though to dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away the Bulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran. One of the Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small club, knocking it into Moran\\'s path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and dropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it � \"TROY SCORES!\" roared Bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers. \"Ten zero to Ireland!\"\\n\\n\"What?\" Harry yelled, looking wildly around through his Omnioculars. \"But Levski\\'s got the Quaffle!\"\\n\\n\"Harry, if you\\'re not going to watch at normal speed, you\\'re going to miss things!\"\\n\\nshouted Hermione, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air while Troy did a lap of honor around the field. Harry looked quickly over the top of his Omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering shamrock. Across the field, the veela were watching them sulkily.\\n\\nFurious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed.\\n\\nHarry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the Irish Chasers were superb.\\n\\nThey worked as a seamless team, their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one another\\'s minds as they positioned themselves, and the rosette on Harry\\'s chest kept squeaking their names: \"Troy � Mullet � Mo ran!\"\\n\\nAnd within ten minutes, Ireland had scored twice more, bringing their lead to thirty�zero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the green� clad supporters.\\n\\nThe match became still faster, but more brutal. Volkov and Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the Irish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves; twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to break through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria\\'s first goal.\\n\\n\"Fingers in your ears!\" bellowed Mr. Weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration. Harry screwed up his eyes too; he wanted to keep his mind on the game. After a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the field. The veela had stopped dancing, and Bulgaria was again in possession of the Quaffle.\\n\\n\"Dimitrov! Levski! Dimitrov! Ivanova � oh I say!\" roared Bagman.\\n\\nOne hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two Seekers, Krum and Lynch, plummeted through the center of the Chasers, so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes. Harry followed their descent through his Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was � \"They\\'re going to crash!\" screamed Hermione next to Harry.\\n\\nShe was half right � at the very last second, Viktor Krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off. Lynch, however, hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose from the Irish seats.\\n\\n\"Fool!\" moaned Mr. Weasley. \"Krum was feinting!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s time�out!\" yelled Bagman\\'s voice, \"as trained mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine Aidan Lynch!\"\\n\\n\"He\\'ll be okay, he only got ploughed!\" Charlie said reassuringly to Ginny, who was hanging over the side of the box, looking horror�struck. \"Which is what Krum was after, of course... .\"\\n\\nHarry hastily pressed the replay and play�by�play buttons on his Omnioculars, twiddled the speed dial, and put them back up to his eyes.\\n\\nHe watched as Krum and Lynch dived again in slow motion. WRONSKI DEFENSIVE FEINT � DANGEROUS SEEKER DIVERSION read the shining purple lettering across his lenses. He saw Krum\\'s face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time, while Lynch was flattened, and he understood � Krum hadn\\'t seen the Snitch at all, he was just making Lynch copy him. Harry had never seen anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all; he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless. Harry turned his Omnioculars back to normal and focused them on Krum. He was now circling high above Lynch, who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion. Harry, focusing still more closely upon Krum\\'s face, saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below. He was using the time while Lynch was revived to look for the Snitch without interference.\\n\\nLynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the green�clad supporters, mounted his Firebolt, and kicked back off into the air. His revival seemed to give Ireland new heart. When Mostafa blew his whistle again, the Chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything Harry had seen so far.\\n\\nAfter fifteen more fast and furious minutes, Ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals. They were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten, and the game was starting to get dirtier.\\n\\nAs Mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again, clutching the Quaffle tightly under her arm, the Bulgarian Keeper, Zograf, flew out to meet her. Whatever happened was over so quickly Harry didn\\'t catch it, but a scream of rage from the Irish crowd, and Mostafa\\'s long, shrill whistle blast, told him it had been a foul.\\n\\n\"And Mostafa takes the Bulgarian Keeper to task for cobbing �� excessive use of elbows!\" Bagman informed the roaring spectators. \"And � yes, it\\'s a penalty to Ireland!\"\\n\\nThe leprechauns, who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when Mullet had been fouled, now darted together to form the words \"HA, HA, HA!\" The veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet, tossed their hair angrily, and started to dance again.\\n\\nAs one, the Weasley boys and Harry stuffed their fingers into their ears, but Hermione, who hadn\\'t bothered, was soon tugging on Harry\\'s arm. He turned to look at her, and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears.\\n\\n\"Look at the referee!\" she said, giggling.\\n\\nHarry looked down at the field. Hassan Mostafa had landed right in front of the dancing veela, and was acting very oddly indeed. He was flexing his muscles and smoothing his mustache excitedly.\\n\\n\"Now, we can\\'t have that!\" said Ludo Bagman, though he sounded highly amused.\\n\\n\"Somebody slap the referee!\"\\n\\nA mediwizard came tearing across the field, his fingers stuffed into his own ears, and kicked Mostafa hard in the shins. Mostafa seemed to come to himself; Harry, watching through the Omnioculars again, saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela, who had stopped dancing and were looking mutinous.\\n\\n\"And unless I\\'m much mistaken, Mostafa is actually attempting to send off the Bulgarian team mascots!\" said Bagman\\'s voice. \"Now there\\'s something we haven\\'t seen before. . . . Oh this could turn nasty. . .\\n\\nIt did: The Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov and Vulchanov, landed on either side of Mostafa and began arguing furiously with him, gesticulating toward the leprechauns, who had now gleefully formed the words \"HEE, HEE, HEE.\"\\n\\nMostafa was not impressed by the Bulgarians\\' arguments, however; he was jabbing his finger into the air, clearly telling them to get flying again, and when they refused, he gave two short blasts on his whistle.\\n\\n\"Two penalties for Ireland!\" shouted Bagman, and the Bulgarian crowd howled\\n\\nwith anger. \"And Volkov and Vulchanov had better get back on those brooms. . .\\n\\nyes. . . there they go. . . and Troy takes the Quaffle. .\\n\\nPlay now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen. The Beaters on both sides were acting without mercy: Volkov and Vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with Bludger or human as they swung them violently through the air. Dimitrov shot straight at Moran, who had the Quaffle, nearly knocking her off her broom.\\n\\n\"Foul!\" roared the Irish supporters as one, all standing up in a great wave of green.\\n\\n\"Foul!\" echoed Ludo Bagman\\'s magically magnified voice. \"Dimitrov skins Moran � deliberately flying to collide there � and it\\'s got to be another penalty � yes, there\\'s the whistle!\"\\n\\nThe leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field. At this, the veela lost control. Instead of dancing, they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns.\\n\\nWatching through his Omnioculars, Harry saw that they didn\\'t look remotely beautiful now. On the contrary, their faces were elongating into sharp, cruel� beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders � \"And that, boys,\" yelled Mr. Weasley over the tumult of the crowd below, \"is why you should never go for looks alone!\"\\n\\nMinistry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns, but with little success; meanwhile, the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above. Harry turned this way and that, staring through his Omnioculars, as the Quaffie changed hands with the speed of a bullet.\\n\\n\"Levski � Dimitrov � Moran � Troy � Mullet � Ivanova � Moran again � Moran � MORAN SCORES!\"\\n\\nBut the cheers of the Irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the veela, the blasts now issuing from the Ministry members\\' wands, and the furious roars of the Bulgarians. The game recommenced immediately; now Levski had the Quaffle, now Dimitrov � The Irish Beater Quigley swung heavily at a passing Bludger, and hit it as hard as possible toward Krum, who did not duck quickly enough. It hit him full in the face.\\n\\nThere was a deafening groan from the crowd; Krum\\'s nose looked broken, there was blood everywhere, but Hassan Mostafa didn\\'t blow his whistle. He had become distracted, and Harry couldn\\'t blame him; one of the veela had thrown a handful of fire and set his broom tail alight.\\n\\nHarry wanted someone to realize that Krum was injured; even though he was\\n\\nsupporting Ireland, Krum was the most exciting player on the field. Ron obviously felt the same.\\n\\n\"Time�out! Ah, come on, he can\\'t play like that, look at him �\"\\n\\n\"Look at Lynch!\" Harry yelled.\\n\\nFor the Irish Seeker had suddenly gone into a dive, and Harry was quite sure that this was no Wronski Feint; this was the real thing...\\n\\n\"He\\'s seen the Snitch!\" Harry shouted. \"He\\'s seen it! Look at him go!\"\\n\\nHalf the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening; the Irish supporters rose in another great wave of green, screaming their Seeker on. . . but Krum was on his tail. How he could see where he was going, Harry had no idea; there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him, but he was drawing level with Lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again � \"They\\'re going to crash!\" shrieked Hermione.\\n\\n\"They\\'re not!\" roared Ron.\\n\\n\"Lynch is!\" yelled Harry.\\n\\nAnd he was right � for the second time, Lynch hit the ground with tremendous force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veela.\\n\\n\"The Snitch, where\\'s the Snitch?\" bellowed Charlie, along the row.\\n\\n\"He\\'s got it � Krum\\'s got it � it\\'s all over!\" shouted Harry.\\n\\nKrum, his red robes shining with blood from his nose, was rising gently into the air, his fist held high, a glint of gold in his hand.\\n\\nThe scoreboard was flashing BULGARIA: 160, IRELAND: 170 across the crowd, who didn\\'t seem to have realized what had happened. Then, slowly, as though a great jumbo jet were revving up, the rumbling from the Ireland supporters grew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight.\\n\\n\"IRELAND WINS!\" Bagman shouted, who like the Irish, seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of the match.\\n\\n\"KRUM GETS THE SNITCH � BUT IRELAND WINS �� good lord, I don\\'t think any of us were expecting that!\"\\n\\n\"What did he catch the Snitch for?\" Ron bellowed, even as he jumped up and down, applauding with his hands over his head. \"He ended it when Ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot!\"\\n\\n\"He knew they were never going to catch up!\" Harry shouted back over all the noise, also applauding loudly. \"The Irish Chasers were too good. . . . He wanted to\\n\\nend it on his terms, that\\'s all. . .\\n\\n\"He was very brave, wasn\\'t he?\" Hermione said, leaning forward to watch Krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling leprechauns and veela to get to him. \"He looks a terrible mess. . .\"\\n\\nHarry put his Omnioculars to his eyes again. It was hard to see what was happening below, because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the field, but he could just make out Krum, surrounded by mediwizards. He looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up. His team members were around him, shaking their heads and looking dejected; a short way away, the Irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from their mascots.\\n\\nFlags were waving all over the stadium, the Irish national anthem blared from all sides; the veela were shrinking back into their usual, beautiful selves now, though looking dispirited and forlorn.\\n\\n\"Vell, ve fought bravely,\" said a gloomy voice behind Harry. He looked around; it was the Bulgarian Minister of Magic.\\n\\n\"You can speak English!\" said Fudge, sounding outraged. \"And you\\'ve been letting me mime everything all day!\"\\n\\n\"Veil, it vos very funny,\" said the Bulgarian minister, shrugging.\\n\\n\"And as the Irish team performs a lap of honor, flanked by their mascots, the Quidditch World Cup itself is brought into the Top Box!\" roared Bagman.\\n\\nHarry\\'s eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light, as the Top Box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside.\\n\\nSquinting toward the entrance, he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box, which they handed to Cornelius Fudge, who was still looking very disgruntled that he\\'d been using sign language all day for nothing.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s have a really loud hand for the gallant losers � Bulgaria!\" Bagman shouted.\\n\\nAnd up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated Bulgarian players. The crowd below was applauding appreciatively; Harry could see thousands and thousands of Omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction.\\n\\nOne by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box, and Bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with Fudge. Krum, who was last in line, looked a real mess. Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face. He was still holding the Snitch. Harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground. He was slightly duck�footed and distinctly round�shouldered. But when Krum\\'s name was announced, the whole stadium gave him a resounding, earsplitting roar.\\n\\nAnd then came the Irish team. Aidan Lynch was being supported by Moran and Connolly; the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked\\n\\nstrangely unfocused. But he grinned happily as Troy and Quigley lifted the Cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval. Harry\\'s hands were numb with clapping.\\n\\nAt last, when the Irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms (Aidan Lynch on the back of Confolly\\'s, clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way), Bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered, \"Quietus.\"\\n\\n\"They\\'ll be talking about this one for years,\" he said hoarsely, \"a really unexpected twist, that. . . . shame it couldn\\'t have lasted longer. . . . Ah yes... . yes, I owe you. .\\n\\n. how much?\"\\n\\nFor Fred and George had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front of Ludo Bagman with broad grins on their faces, their hands outstretched.\\n\\nCHAPTER NINE � THE DARK MARK\\n\\nDon\\'t tell your mother you\\'ve been gambling,\" Mr. Weasley implored Fred and George as they all made their way slowly down the purple�carpeted stairs.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry, Dad,\" said Fred gleefully, \"we\\'ve got big plans for this money. We don\\'t want it confiscated.\"\\n\\nMr. Weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were, but seemed to decide, upon reflection, that he didn\\'t want to know.\\n\\nThey were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their campsites. Raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the lantern�lit path, and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads, cackling and waving their lanterns. When they finally reached the tents, nobody felt like sleeping at all, and given the level of noise around them, Mr. Weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in. They were soon arguing enjoyably about the match; Mr. Weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with Charlie, and it was only when Ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that Mr. Weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed. Hermione and Ginny went into the next tent, and Harry and the rest of the Weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks. From the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang.\\n\\n\"Oh I am glad I\\'m not on duty,\" muttered Mr. Weasley sleepily. \"I wouldn\\'t fancy having to go and tell the Irish they\\'ve got to stop celebrating.\"\\n\\nHarry, who was on a top bunk above Ron, lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent, watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead, and picturing again some of Krum\\'s more spectacular moves. He was itching to get back on his own Firebolt and try out the Wronski Feint. . . . Somehow Oliver Wood had never managed to convey with all his wriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to look like.. . . Harry saw himself in robes that had his name on the back, and imagined the sensation of hearing a hundred�thousand�strong crowd roar, as Ludo Bagman\\'s voice echoed throughout the stadium, \"I give you. .\\n\\n. Potter!\"\\n\\nHarry never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off to sleep � his fantasies of flying like Krum might well have slipped into actual dreams � all he knew was that, quite suddenly, Mr. Weasley was shouting.\\n\\n\"Get up! Ron � Harry � come on now, get up, this is urgent!\"\\n\\nHarry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvas.\\n\\n\"S\\' matter?\" he said.\\n\\nDimly, he could tell that something was wrong. The noises in the campsite had changed. The singing had stopped. He could hear screams, and the sound of people running. He slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes, but Mr. Weasley, who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas, said, \"No time, Harry � just grab a jacket and get outside � quickly!\"\\n\\nHarry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent, Ron at his heels.\\n\\nBy the light of the few fires that were still burning, he could see people running away into the woods, fleeing something that was moving across the field toward them, something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire.\\n\\nLoud jeering, roars of laughter, and drunken yells were drifting toward them; then came a burst of strong green light, which illuminated the scene.\\n\\nA crowd of wizards, tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upward, was marching slowly across the field. Harry squinted at them. . . .\\n\\nThey didn\\'t seem to have faces. . . . Then he realized that their heads were hooded and their faces masked. High above them, floating along in midair, four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes. It was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers, and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air.\\n\\nTwo of the figures were very small.\\n\\nMore wizards were joining the marching group, laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies. Tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled. Once or twice Harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with his wand.\\n\\nSeveral caught fire. The screaming grew louder.\\n\\nThe floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent and Harry recognized one of them: Mr. Roberts, the campsite manager. The other three looked as though they might be his wife and children. One of the marchers below flipped Mrs. Roberts upside down with his wand; her nightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee.\\n\\n\"That\\'s sick,\" Ron muttered, watching the smallest Muggle child, who had begun to spin like a top, sixty feet above the ground, his head flopping limply from side to side. \"That is really sick. . . .\"\\n\\nHermione and Ginny came hurrying toward them, pulling coats over their nightdresses, with Mr. Weasley right behind them. At the same moment, Bill, Charlie, and Percy emerged from the boys\\' tent, fully dressed, with their sleeves rolled up and their wands out.\\n\\n\"We\\'re going to help the Ministry!\" Mr. Weasley shouted over all the noise, rolling up his own sleeves. \"You lot � get into the woods, and stick together. I\\'ll come and fetch you when we\\'ve sorted this out!\"\\n\\nBill, Charlie, and Percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming marchers; Mr. Weasley tore after them. Ministry wizards were dashing from every direction toward the source of the trouble. The crowd beneath the Roberts family was coming ever closer.\\n\\n\"C\\'mon,\" said Fred, grabbing Ginny\\'s hand and starting to pull her toward the wood. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and George followed. They all looked back as they reached the trees. The crowd beneath the Roberts family was larger than ever; they could see the Ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the center, but they were having great difficulty. It looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the Roberts family fall.\\n\\nThe colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished.\\n\\nDark figures were blundering through the trees; children were crying; anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air.\\n\\nHarry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see. Then he heard Ron yell with pain.\\n\\n\"What happened?\" said Hermione anxiously, stopping so abruptly that Harry walked into her. \"Ron, where are you? Oh this is stupid � lumos!\"\\n\\nShe illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path. Ron was lying sprawled on the ground.\\n\\n\"Tripped over a tree root,\" he said angrily, getting to his feet again.\\n\\n\"Well, with feet that size, hard not to,\" said a drawling voice from behind them.\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione turned sharply. Draco Malfoy was standing alone nearby, leaning against a tree, looking utterly relaxed. His arms folded, he seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees.\\n\\nRon told Malfoy to do something that Harry knew he would never have dared say in front of Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\n\"Language, Weasley,\" said Malfoy, his pale eyes glittering. \"Hadn\\'t you better be hurrying along, now? You wouldn\\'t like her spotted, would you?\"\\n\\nHe nodded at Hermione, and at the same moment, a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite, and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that supposed to mean?\" said Hermione defiantly. \"Granger, they\\'re after Muggles, \"said Malfoy. \"D\\'you want to be showing off your knickers in midair!\\n\\nBecause if you do, hang around. . . they\\'re moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.\"\\n\\n\"Hermione\\'s a witch,\" Harry snarled.\\n\\n\"Have it your own way, Potter,\" said Malfoy, grinning maliciously. \"If you think\\n\\nthey can\\'t spot a Mudblood, stay where you are.\"\\n\\n\"You watch your mouth!\" shouted Ron. Everybody present knew that \"Mudblood\"\\n\\nwas a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of Muggle parentage.\\n\\n\"Never mind, Ron,\" said Hermione quickly, seizing Ron\\'s arm to restrain him as he took a step toward Malfoy.\\n\\nThere came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard. Several people nearby screamed. Malfoy chuckled softly.\\n\\n\"Scare easily, don\\'t they?\" he said lazily. \"I suppose your daddy told you all to hide? What\\'s he up to � trying to rescue the Muggles?\"\\n\\n\"Where\\'re your parents?\" said Harry, his temper rising. \"Out there wearing masks, are they?\"\\n\\nMalfoy turned his face to Harry, still smiling.\\n\\n\"Well. . . if they were, I wouldn\\'t be likely to tell you, would I, Potter?\"\\n\\n\"Oh come on,\" said Hermione, with a disgusted look at Malfoy, \"let\\'s go and find the others.\"\\n\\n\"Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,\" sneered Malfoy.\\n\\n\"Come on,\" Hermione repeated, and she pulled Harry and Ron up the path again.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot!\" said Ron hotly.\\n\\n\"Well, with any luck, the Ministry will catch him!\" said Hermione fervently. \"Oh I can\\'t believe this. Where have the others got to?\"\\n\\nFred, George, and Ginny were nowhere to be seen, though the path was packed with plenty of other people, all looking nervously over their shoulders toward the commotion back at the campsite. A huddle of teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a little way along the path. When they saw Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly, \"O� est Madame Maxime? Nous l\\'avons perdue �\"\\n\\n\"Er � what?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Oh. . .\" The girl who had spoken turned her back on him, and as they walked on they distinctly heard her say, \"Ogwarts.\"\\n\\n\"Beauxbatons,\" muttered Hermione.\\n\\n\"Sorry?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"They must go to Beauxbatons,\" said Hermione. \"You know... Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. . . I read about it in An Appraisal ofMagical Education in Europe.\"\\n\\n\"Oh. . . yeah. . . right,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Fred and George can\\'t have gone that far,\" said Ron, pulling out his wand, lighting it like Hermione\\'s, and squinting up the path. Harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand � but it wasn\\'t there. The only thing he could find was his Omnioculars.\\n\\n\"Ah, no, I don\\'t believe it. . . I\\'ve lost my wand!\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re kidding!\"\\n\\nRon and Hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of light farther on the ground; Harry looked all around him, but his wand was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\n\"Maybe it\\'s back in the tent,\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running?\" Hermione suggested anxiously.\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"maybe. .\\n\\nHe usually kept his wand with him at all times in the wizarding world, and finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very vulnerable.\\n\\nA rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump. Winky the house�elf was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby. She was moving in a most peculiar fashion, apparently with great difficulty; it was as though someone invisible were trying to hold her back.\\n\\n\"There is bad wizards about!\" she squeaked distractedly as she leaned forward and labored to keep running. \"People high � high in the air! Winky is getting out of the way!\"\\n\\nAnd she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path, panting and squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her.\\n\\n\"What\\'s up with her?\" said Ron, looking curiously after Winky. \"Why can\\'t she run properly?\"\\n\\n\"Bet she didn\\'t ask permission to hide,\" said Harry. He was thinking of Dobby:\\n\\nEvery time he had tried to do something the Malfoys wouldn\\'t like, the house�elf had been forced to start beating himself up.\\n\\n\"You know, house�elves get a very raw deal!\" said Hermione indignantly. \"It\\'s slavery, that\\'s what it is! That Mr. Crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium, and she was terrified, and he\\'s got her bewitched so she can\\'t even run when they start trampling tents! Why doesn\\'t anyone do something about it?\"\\n\\n\"Well, the elves are happy, aren\\'t they?\" Ron said. \"You heard old Winky back at the match.. . \\'House�elves is not supposed to have fun\\'. . . that\\'s what she likes,\\n\\nbeing bossed around. . . .\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s people like you, Ron,\" Hermione began hotly, \"who prop up rotten and unjust systems, just because they\\'re too lazy to �\"\\n\\nAnother loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s just keep moving, shall we?\" said Ron, and Harry saw him glance edgily at Hermione. Perhaps there was truth in what Malfoy had said; perhaps Hermione was in more danger than they were. They set off again, Harry still searching his pockets, even though he knew his wand wasn\\'t there.\\n\\nThey followed the dark path deeper into the wood, still keeping an eye out for Fred, George, and Ginny. They passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match, and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite. Farther still along the path, they walked into a patch of silvery light, and when they looked through the trees, they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing, surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards, all of whom were talking very loudly.\\n\\n\"I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year!\" one of them shouted. \"I\\'m a dragon killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.\"\\n\\n\"No, you\\'re not!\" yelled his friend. \"You\\'re a dishwasher at the Leaky Cauldron. . .\\n\\n. but I\\'m a vampire hunter, I\\'ve killed about ninety so far �\"\\n\\nA third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even by the dim, silvery light of the veela, now cut in, \"I\\'m about to become the youngest ever Minister of Magic, I am.\"\\n\\nHarry snorted with laughter. He recognized the pimply wizard: His name was Stan Shunpike, and he was in fact a conductor on the triple�decker Knight Bus. He turned to tell Ron this, but Ron\\'s face had gone oddly slack, and next second Ron was yelling, \"Did I tell you I\\'ve invented a broomstick that\\'ll reach Jupiter?\"\\n\\n\"Honestly!\" said Hermione, and she and Harry grabbed Ron firmly by the arms, wheeled him around, and marched him away. By the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely, they were in the very heart of the wood.\\n\\nThey seemed to be alone now; everything was much quieter.\\n\\nHarry looked around. \"I reckon we can just wait here, you know. We\\'ll hear anyone coming a mile off.\"\\n\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth, when Ludo Bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them.\\n\\nEven by the feeble light of the two wands, Harry could see that a great change had come over Bagman. He no longer looked buoyant and rosy�faced; there was no more spring in his step. He looked very white and strained.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s that?\" he said, blinking down at them, trying to make out their faces.\\n\\n\"What are you doing in here, all alone?\"\\n\\nThey looked at one another, surprised.\\n\\n\"Well � there\\'s a sort of riot going on,\" said Ron.\\n\\nBagman stared at him.\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"At the campsite. . . some people have got hold of a family of Muggles. . .\\n\\nBagman swore loudly.\\n\\n\"Damn them!\" he said, looking quite distracted, and without another word, he Disapparated with a small pop!\\n\\n\"Not exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he?\" said Hermione, frowning.\\n\\n\"He was a great Beater, though,\" said Ron, leading the way off the path into a small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree. \"The Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them.\"\\n\\nHe took his small figure of Krum out of his pocket, set it down on the ground, and watched it walk around. Like the real Krum, the model was slightly duck�footed and round�shouldered, much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick. Harry was listening for noise from the campsite. Everything seemed much quieter; perhaps the riot was over.\\n\\n\"I hope the others are okay,\" said Hermione after a while.\\n\\n\"They\\'ll be fine,\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy,\" said Harry, sitting down next to Ron and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves. \"He\\'s always said he\\'d like to get something on him.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'d wipe the smirk off old Draco\\'s face, all right,\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Those poor Muggles, though,\" said Hermione nervously. \"What if they can\\'t get them down?\"\\n\\n\"They will,\" said Ron reassuringly. \"They\\'ll find a way.\"\\n\\n\"Mad, though, to do something like that when the whole Ministry of Magic\\'s out here tonight!\" said Hermione. \"I mean, how do they expect to get away with it? Do you think they\\'ve been drinking, or are they just �\"\\n\\nBut she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder. Harry and Ron looked quickly around too. It sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing. They waited, listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark\\n\\ntrees. But the footsteps came to a sudden halt.\\n\\n\"Hello?\" called Harry.\\n\\nThere was silence. Harry got to his feet and peered around the tree. It was too dark to see very far, but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his vision.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s there?\" he said.\\n\\nAnd then, without warning, the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood; and it uttered, not a panicked shout, but what sounded like a spell.\\n\\n\"MORSMORDRE!\"\\n\\nAnd something vast, green, and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness Harry\\'s eyes had been struggling to penetrate; it flew up over the treetops and into the sky.\\n\\n\"What the � ?\" gasped Ron as he sprang to his feet again, staring up at the thing that had appeared.\\n\\nFor a split second, Harry thought it was another leprechaun formation. Then he realized that it was a colossal skull, comprised of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue. As they watched, it rose higher and higher, blazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched against the black sky like a new constellation.\\n\\nSuddenly, the wood all around them erupted with screams. Harry didn\\'t understand why, but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull, which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign. He scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull, but he couldn\\'t see anyone.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s there?\" he called again.\\n\\n\"Harry, come on, move!\" Hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" Harry said, startled to see her face so white and terrified.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the Dark Mark, Harry!\" Hermione moaned, pulling him as hard as she could.\\n\\n\"You�Know�Who\\'s sign!\"\\n\\n\"Voldemort\\'s � \"Harry, come on!\"\\n\\nHarry turned � Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum � the three of them started across the clearing � but before they had taken a few hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards, appearing from thin air, surrounding them.\\n\\nHarry whirled around, and in an instant, he registered one fact: Each of these wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself, Ron, and Hermione.\\n\\nWithout pausing to think, he yelled, \"DUCK!\"\\n\\nHe seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground.\\n\\n\"STUPEFY!\" roared twenty voices � there was a blinding series of flashes and Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards\\' wands, crossing one another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness�� \"Stop!\" yelled a voice he recognized. \"STOP! That\\'s my son!\"\\n\\nHarry\\'s hair stopped blowing about. He raised his head a little higher. The wizard in front of him had lowered his wand. He rolled over and saw Mr. Weasley striding toward them, looking terrified.\\n\\n\"Ron � Harry\" � his voice sounded shaky � \"Hermione � are you all right?\"\\n\\n\"Out of the way, Arthur,\" said a cold, curt voice.\\n\\nIt was Mr. Crouch. He and the other Ministry wizards were closing in on them.\\n\\nHarry got to his feet to face them. Mr. Crouch\\'s face was taut with rage.\\n\\n\"Which of you did it?\" he snapped, his sharp eyes darting between them. \"Which of you conjured the Dark Mark?\"\\n\\n\"We didn\\'t do that!\" said Harry, gesturing up at the skull.\\n\\n\"We didn\\'t do anything!\" said Ron, who was rubbing his elbow and looking indignantly at his father. \"What did you want to attack us for?\"\\n\\n\"Do not lie, sir!\" shouted Mr. Crouch. His wand was still pointing directly at Ron, and his eyes were popping � he looked slightly mad. \"You have been discovered at the scene of the crime!\"\\n\\n\"Barty,\" whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown, \"they\\'re kids, Barty, they\\'d never have been able to \"Where did the Mark come from, you three?\" said Mr. Weasley quickly.\\n\\n\"Over there,\" said Hermione shakily, pointing at the place where they had heard the voice. \"There was someone behind the trees. . . they shouted words � an incantation �\"\\n\\n\"Oh, stood over there, did they?\" said Mr. Crouch, turning his popping eyes on Hermione now, disbelief etched all over his face. \"Said an incantation, did they!\\n\\nYou seem very well informed about how that Mark is summoned, missy �\"\\n\\nBut none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr. Crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that Harry, Ron, or Hermione had conjured the skull; on the contrary, at Hermione\\'s words, they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees.\\n\\n\"We\\'re too late,\" said the witch in the woolen dressing gown, shaking her head.\\n\\n\"They\\'ll have Disapparated.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think so,\" said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard. It was Amos Diggory, Cedric\\'s father. \"Our Stunners went right through those trees. . . . There\\'s a good chance we got them. . .\\n\\n\"Amos, be careful!\" said a few of the wizards warningly as Mr. Diggory squared his shoulders, raised his wand, marched across the clearing, and disappeared into the darkness. Hermione watched him vanish with her hands over her mouth.\\n\\nA few seconds later, they heard Mr. Diggory shout.\\n\\n\"Yes! We got them! There\\'s someone here! Unconscious! It\\'s � but � blimey. .\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got someone?\" shouted Mr. Crouch, sounding highly disbelieving. \"Who!\\n\\nWho is it?\"\\n\\nThey heard snapping twigs, the rustling of leaves, and then crunching footsteps as Mr. Diggory reemerged from behind the trees. He was carrying a tiny, limp figure in his arms. Harry recognized the tea towel at once. It was Winky.\\n\\nMr. Crouch did not move or speak as Mr. Diggory deposited his elf on the ground at his feet. The other Ministry wizards were all staring at Mr. Crouch. For a few seconds Crouch remained transfixed, his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared down at Winky. Then he appeared to come to life again.\\n\\n\"This � cannot � be,\" he said jerkily. \"No �\"\\n\\nHe moved quickly around Mr. Diggory and strode off toward the place where he had found Winky.\\n\\n\"No point, Mr. Crouch,\" Mr. Diggory called after him. \"There\\'s no one else there.\"\\n\\nBut Mr. Crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it. They could hear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside, searching.\\n\\n\"Bit embarrassing,\" Mr. Diggory said grimly, looking down at Winky\\'s unconscious form. \"Barty Crouch\\'s house�elf. . . I mean to say...\"\\n\\n\"Come off it, Amos,\" said Mr. Weasley quietly, \"you don\\'t seriously think it was the elf? The Dark Mark\\'s a wizard\\'s sign. It requires a wand.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Mr. Diggory, \"and she had a wand.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Mr. Weasley.\\n\\n\"Here, look.\" Mr. Diggory held up a wand and showed it to Mr. Weasley. \"Had it in her hand. So that\\'s clause three of the Code of Wand Use broken, for a start. No non�human creature is permitted to carry or use a wand.\"\\n\\nJust then there was another pop, and Ludo Bagman Apparated right next to Mr.\\n\\nWeasley. Looking breathless and disorientated, he spun on the spot, goggling upward at the emerald�green skull.\\n\\n\"The Dark Mark!\" he panted, almost trampling Winky as he turned inquiringly to his colleagues. \"Who did it? Did you get them? Barry! What\\'s going on?\"\\n\\nMr. Crouch had returned empty�handed. His face was still ghostly white, and his hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitching.\\n\\n\"Where have you been, Barty?\" said Bagman. \"Why weren\\'t you at the match!\\n\\nYour elf was saving you a seat too � gulping gargoyles!\" Bagman had just noticed Winky lying at his feet. \"What happened to her?\"\\n\\n\"I have been busy, Ludo,\" said Mr. Crouch, still talking in the same jerky fashion, barely moving his lips. \"And my elf has been stunned.\"\\n\\n\"Stunned? By you lot, you mean? But why � ?\"\\n\\nComprehension dawned suddenly on Bagman\\'s round, shiny face; he looked up at the skull, down at Winky, and then at Mr. Crouch.\\n\\n\"No!\" he said. \"Winky? Conjure the Dark Mark? She wouldn\\'t know how! She\\'d need a wand, for a start!\"\\n\\n\"And she had one,\" said Mr. Diggory. \"I found her holding one, Ludo. If it\\'s all right with you, Mr. Crouch, I think we should hear what she\\'s got to say for herself.\"\\n\\nCrouch gave no sign that he had heard Mr. Diggory, but Mr. Diggory seemed to take his silence for assent. He raised his own wand, pointed it at Winky, and said, \"Ennervate!\"\\n\\nWinky stirred feebly. Her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way. Watched by the silent wizards, she raised herself shakily into a sitting position.\\n\\nShe caught sight of Mr. Diggory\\'s feet, and slowly, tremulously, raised her eyes to stare up into his face; then, more slowly still, she looked up into the sky. Harry could see the floating skull reflected twice in her enormous, glassy eyes. She gave a gasp, looked wildly around the crowded clearing, and burst into terrified sobs.\\n\\n\"Elf!\" said Mr. Diggory sternly. \"Do you know who I am? I\\'m a member of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures!\"\\n\\nWinky began to rock backward and forward on the ground, her breath coming in\\n\\nsharp bursts. Harry was reminded forcibly of Dobby in his moments of terrified disobedience.\\n\\n\"As you see, elf, the Dark Mark was conjured here a short while ago,\" said Mr.\\n\\nDiggory. \"And you were discovered moments later, right beneath it! An explanation, if you please!\"\\n\\n\"I � I � I is not doing it, sir!\" Winky gasped. \"I is not knowing how, sir!\"\\n\\n\"You were found with a wand in your hand!\" barked Mr. Diggory, brandishing it in front of her. And as the wand caught the green light that was filling the clearing from the skull above, Harry recognized it \"Hey � that\\'s mine!\" he said Everyone in the clearing looked at him.\\n\\n\"Excuse me?\" said Mr. Diggory, incredulously.\\n\\n\"That\\'s my wand!\" said Harry. \"I dropped it!\"\\n\\n\"You dropped it?\" repeated Mr. Diggory in disbelief. \"Is this a confession? You threw it aside after you conjured the Mark?\"\\n\\n\"Amos, think who you\\'re talking to!\" said Mr. Weasley, very angrily. \"Is Harry Potter likely to conjure the Dark Mark?\"\\n\\n\"Er � of course not,\" mumbled Mr. Diggory. \"Sorry. . . carried away. .\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t drop it there, anyway,\" said Harry, jerking his thumb toward the trees beneath the skull. \"I missed it right after we got into the wood.\"\\n\\n\"So,\" said Mr. Diggory, his eyes hardening as he turned to look at Winky again, cowering at his feet. \"You found this wand, eh, elf? And you picked it up and thought you\\'d have some fun with it, did you?\"\\n\\n\"I is not doing magic with it, sir!\" squealed Winky, tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose. \"I is. . . I is. . . I is just picking it up, sir! i is not making the Dark Mark, sir, i is not knowing how!\"\\n\\n\"It wasn\\'t her!\" said Hermione. She looked very nervous, speaking up in front of all these Ministry wizards, yet determined all the same. \"Winky\\'s got a squeaky little voice, and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper!\" She looked around at Harry and Ron, appealing for their support. \"It didn\\'t sound anything like Winky, did it?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry, shaking his head. \"It definitely didn\\'t sound like an elf.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, it was a human voice,\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll soon see,\" growled Mr. Diggory, looking unimpressed. \"There\\'s a\\n\\nsimple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed, elf, did you know that?\"\\n\\nWinky trembled and shook her head frantically, her ears flapping, as Mr. Diggory raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with Harry\\'s.\\n\\n\"Prior Incantato!\" roared Mr. Diggory.\\n\\nHarry heard Hermione gasp, horrified, as a gigantic serpent�tongued skull erupted from the point where the two wands met, but it was a mere shadow of the green skull high above them; it looked as though it were made of thick gray smoke: the ghost of a spell.\\n\\n\"Deletrius!\" Mr. Diggory shouted, and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of smoke.\\n\\n\"So,\" said Mr. Diggory with a kind of savage triumph, looking down upon Winky, who was still shaking convulsively.\\n\\n\"I is not doing it!\" she squealed, her eyes rolling in terror. \"I is not, I is not, I is not knowing how! I is a good elf, I isn\\'t using wands, I isn\\'t knowing how!\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve been caught red�handed, elf!\" Mr. Diggory roared. \"Caught with the guilty wand in your hand!\"\\n\\n\"Amos,\" said Mr. Weasley loudly, \"think about it. . . precious few wizards know how to do that spell. . . . Where would she have learned it?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps Amos is suggesting,\" said Mr. Crouch, cold anger in every syllable, \"that I routinely teach my servants to conjure the Dark Mark?\"\\n\\nThere was a deeply unpleasant silence. Amos Diggory looked horrified. \"Mr.\\n\\nCrouch.. . not. . . not at all.\\n\\n\"You have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing who are least likely to conjure that Mark!\" barked Mr. Crouch. \"Harry Potter � and myself. I suppose you are familiar with the boy\\'s story, Amos?\"\\n\\n\"Of course � everyone knows �\" muttered Mr. Diggory, looking highly discomforted.\\n\\n\"And I trust you remember the many proofs I have given, over a long career, that I despise and detest the Dark Arts and those who practice them?\" Mr. Crouch shouted, his eyes bulging again.\\n\\n\"Mr. Crouch, I � I never suggested you had anything to do with it!\" Amos Diggory muttered again, now reddening behind his scrubby brown beard.\\n\\n\"If you accuse my elf, you accuse me, Diggory!\" shouted Mr. Crouch. \"Where else would she have learned to conjure it?\"\\n\\n\"She � she might\\'ve picked it up anywhere �\"\\n\\n\"Precisely, Amos,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"She might have picked it up anywhere.. . .\\n\\nWinky?\" he said kindly, turning to the elf, but she flinched as though he too was shouting at her. \"Where exactly did you find Harry\\'s wand?\"\\n\\nWinky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently that it was fraying beneath her fingers.\\n\\n\"I � I is finding it. . . finding it there, sir. . . .\" she whispered, \"there . . . in the trees, sir.\\n\\n\"You see, Amos?\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Whoever conjured the Mark could have Disapparated right after they\\'d done it, leaving Harry\\'s wand behind. A clever thing to do, not using their own wand, which could have betrayed them. And Winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it up.\"\\n\\n\"But then, she\\'d have been only a few feet away from the real culprit!\" said Mr.\\n\\nDiggory impatiently. \"Elf? Did you see anyone?\"\\n\\nWinky began to tremble worse than ever. Her giant eyes flickered from Mr.\\n\\nDiggory, to Ludo Bagman, and onto Mr. Crouch. Then she gulped and said, \"I is seeing no one, sir. . . no one. .\\n\\n\"Amos,\" said Mr. Crouch curtly, \"I am fully aware that, in the ordinary course of events, you would want to take Winky into your department for questioning. I ask you, however, to allow me to deal with her.\"\\n\\nMr. Diggory looked as though he didn\\'t think much of this suggestion at all, but it was clear to Harry that Mr. Crouch was such an important member of the Ministry that he did not dare refuse him.\\n\\n\"You may rest assured that she will be punished,\" Mr. Crouch added coldly.\\n\\n\"M�m�master. . .\" Winky stammered, looking up at Mr. Crouch, her eyes brimming with tears. \"M�m�master, p�p�please. . .\"\\n\\nMr. Crouch stared back, his face somehow sharpened, each line upon it more deeply etched. There was no pity in his gaze.\\n\\n\"Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible,\" he said slowly. \"I told her to remain in the tent. I told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble. And I find that she disobeyed me. This means clothes.\"\\n\\n\"No!\" shrieked Winky, prostrating herself at Mr. Crouch\\'s feet. \"No, master! Not clothes, not clothes!\"\\n\\nHarry knew that the only way to turn a house�elf free was to present it with proper garments. It was pitiful to see the way Winky clutched at her tea towel as she\\n\\nsobbed over Mr. Crouch\\'s feet.\\n\\n\"But she was frightened!\" Hermione burst out angrily, glaring at Mr. Crouch.\\n\\n\"Your elf\\'s scared of heights, and those wizards in masks were levitating people!\\n\\nYou can\\'t blame her for wanting to get out of their way!\"\\n\\nMr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact with the elf, whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his over�shined shoes.\\n\\n\"I have no use for a house�elf who disobeys me,\" he said coldly, looking over at Hermione. \"I have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master, and to her master\\'s reputation.\"\\n\\nWinky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing. There was a very nasty silence, which was ended by Mr. Weasley, who said quietly, \"Well, I think I\\'ll take my lot back to the tent, if nobody\\'s got any objections. Amos, that wand\\'s told us all it can � if Harry could have it back, please �\"\\n\\nMr. Diggory handed Harry his wand and Harry pocketed it.\\n\\n\"Come on, you three,\" Mr. Weasley said quietly. But Hermione didn\\'t seem to want to move; her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf. \"Hermione!\" Mr. Weasley said, more urgently. She turned and followed Harry and Ron out of the clearing and off through the trees.\\n\\n\"What\\'s going to happen to Winky?\" said Hermione, the moment they had left the clearing.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Mr. Weasley.\\n\\n\"The way they were treating her!\" said Hermione furiously. \"Mr. Diggory, calling her \\'elf\\' all the time. . . and Mr. Crouch! He knows she didn\\'t do it and he\\'s still going to sack her! He didn\\'t care how frightened she\\'d been, or how upset she was � it was like she wasn\\'t even human!\"\\n\\n\"Well, she\\'s not,\" said Ron.\\n\\nHermione rounded on him.\\n\\n\"That doesn\\'t mean she hasn\\'t got feelings, Ron. It\\'s disgusting the way �\"\\n\\n\"Hermione, I agree with you,\" said Mr. Weasley quickly, beckoning her on, \"but now is not the time to discuss elf rights. I want to get back to the tent as fast as we can. What happened to the others?\"\\n\\n\"We lost them in the dark,\" said Ron. \"Dad, why was everyone so uptight about that skull thing?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll explain everything back at the tent,\" said Mr. Weasley tensely.\\n\\nBut when they reached the edge of the wood, their progress was impeded. A large crowd of frightened�looking witches and wizards was congregated there, and when they saw Mr. Weasley coming toward them, many of them surged forward.\\n\\n\"What\\'s going on in there?\"\\n\\n\"Who conjured it?\"\\n\\n\"Arthur � it\\'s not � Him?\"\\n\\n\"Of course it\\'s not Him,\" said Mr. Weasley impatiently. \"We don\\'t know who it was; it looks like they Disapparated. Now excuse me, please, I want to get to bed.\"\\n\\nHe led Harry, Ron, and Hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite.\\n\\nAll was quiet now; there was no sign of the masked wizards, though several ruined tents were still smoking.\\n\\nCharlie\\'s head was poking out of the boys\\' tent.\\n\\n\"Dad, what\\'s going on?\" he called through the dark. \"Fred, George, and Ginny got back okay, but the others �\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got them here,\" said Mr. Weasley, bending down and entering the tent.\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione entered after him.\\n\\nBill was sitting at the small kitchen table, holding a bedsheet to his arm, which was bleeding profusely. Charlie had a large rip in his shirt, and Percy was sporting a bloody nose. Fred, George, and Ginny looked unhurt, though shaken.\\n\\n\"Did you get them, Dad?\" said Bill sharply. \"The person who conjured the Mark?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"We found Barry Crouch\\'s elf holding Harry\\'s wand, but we\\'re none the wiser about who actually conured the Mark.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Bill, Charlie, and Percy together. \"Harry\\'s wand?\" said Fred.\\n\\n\"Mr. Crouch\\'s elf\" said Percy, sounding thunderstruck.\\n\\nWith some assistance from Harry, Ron, and Hermione, Mr. Weasley explained what had happened in the woods. When they had finished their story, Percy swelled indignantly.\\n\\n\"Well, Mr. Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that!\" he said. \"Running away when he\\'d expressly told her not to. . . embarrassing him in front of the whole Ministry. . . how would that have looked, if she\\'d been brought up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control �\"\\n\\n\"She didn\\'t do anything � she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time!\"\\n\\nHermione snapped at Percy, who looked very taken aback. Hermione had always got on fairly well with Percy � better, indeed, than any of the others.\\n\\n\"Hermione, a wizard in Mr. Crouch\\'s position can\\'t afford a house�elf who\\'s going to run amok with a wand!\" said Percy pompously, recovering himself.\\n\\n\"She didn\\'t run amok!\" shouted Hermione. \"She just picked it up off the ground!\"\\n\\n\"Look, can someone just explain what that skull thing was?\" said Ron impatiently.\\n\\n\"It wasn\\'t hurting anyone. . . . Why\\'s it such a big deal?\"\\n\\n\"I told you, it\\'s You�Know�Who\\'s symbol, Ron,\" said Hermione, before anyone else could answer. \"I read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts.\"\\n\\n\"And it hasn\\'t been seen for thirteen years,\" said Mr. Weasley quietly. \"Of course people panicked. . . it was almost like seeing You�Know�Who back again.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t get it,\" said Ron, frowning. \"I mean. . . it\\'s still only a shape in the sky. . .\\n\\n\"Ron, You�Know�Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever they killed,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"The terror it inspired. . . you have no idea, you\\'re too young. Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house, and knowing what you\\'re about to find inside. . . .\" Mr. Weasley winced. \"Everyone\\'s worst fear. . . the very worst..\\n\\nThere was silence for a moment. Then Bill, removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut, said, \"Well, it didn\\'t help us tonight, whoever conjured it. It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it. They all Disapparated before we\\'d got near enough to unmask any of them. We caught the Robertses before they hit the ground, though. They\\'re having their memories modified right now.\"\\n\\n\"Death Eaters?\" said Harry. \"What are Death Eaters?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s what You�Know�Who\\'s supporters called themselves,\" said Bill. \"I think we saw what\\'s left of them tonight � the ones who managed to keep themselves out of Azkaban, anyway.\"\\n\\n\"We can\\'t prove it was them, Bill,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Though it probably was,\"\\n\\nhe added hopelessly.\\n\\n\"Yeah, I bet it was!\" said Ron suddenly . \"Dad, we met Draco Malfoy in the woods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks! And we all know the Malfoys were right in with You�Know�Who!\"\\n\\n\"But what were Voldemort\\'s supporters �\" Harry began. Everybody flinched � like most of the wizarding world, the Weasleys always avoided saying Voldemort\\'s name. \"Sorry,\" said Harry quickly. \"What were You�Know�Who\\'s supporters up to, levitating Muggles? I mean, what was the point?\"\\n\\n\"The point?\" said Mr. Weasley with a hollow laugh. \"Harry, that\\'s their idea of fun. Half the Muggle killings back when You�Know�Who was in power were done for fun. I suppose they had a few drinks tonight and couldn\\'t resist reminding\\n\\nus all that lots of them are still at large. A nice little reunion for them,\" he finished disgustedly.\\n\\n\"But if they were the Death Eaters, why did they Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark?\" said Ron. \"They\\'d have been pleased to see it, wouldn\\'t they?\"\\n\\n\"Use your brains, Ron,\" said Bill. \"If they really were Death Eaters, they worked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when You�Know�Who lost power, and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people. I bet they\\'d be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back. They denied they\\'d ever been involved with him when he lost his powers, and went back to their daily lives. . . . I don\\'t reckon he\\'d be over�pleased with them, do you?\"\\n\\n\"So. . . whoever conjured the Dark Mark. . .\" said Hermione slowly, \"were they doing it to show support for the Death Eaters, or to scare them away?\"\\n\\n\"Your guess is as good as ours, Hermione,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"But I\\'ll tell you this. . . it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it. I\\'d be very surprised if the person who did it hadn\\'t been a Death Eater once, even if they\\'re not now. . Listen, it\\'s very late, and if your mother hears what\\'s happened she\\'ll be worried sick. We\\'ll get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early Portkey out of here.\"\\n\\nHarry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing. He knew he ought to feel exhausted: It was nearly three in the morning, but he felt wide�awake � wide� awake, and worried.\\n\\nThree days ago � it felt like much longer, but it had only been three days � he had awoken with his scar burning. And tonight, for the first time in thirteen years, Lord Voldemort\\'s mark had appeared in the sky. What did these things mean!\\n\\nHe thought of the letter he had written to Sirius before leaving Privet Drive.\\n\\nWould Sirius have gotten it yet? When would he reply? Harry lay looking up at the canvas, but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep, and it was a long time after Charlie\\'s snores filled the tent that Harry finally dozed off.\\n\\nCHAPTER TEN � MAYHEM AT THE MINISTRY\\n\\nMr. Weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep. He used magic to pack up the tents, and they left the campsite as quickly as possible, passing Mr. Roberts at the door of his cottage. Mr. Roberts had a strange, dazed look about him, and he waved them off with a vague \"Merry Christmas.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'ll be all right,\" said Mr. Weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor.\\n\\n\"Sometimes, when a person\\'s memory\\'s modified, it makes him a bit disorientated for a while...and that was a big thing they had to make him forget.\"\\n\\nThey heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the Portkeys lay, and when they reached it, they found a great number of witches and wizards gathered around Basil, the keeper of the Portkeys, all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as possible. Mr. Weasley had a hurried discussion with Basil; they joined the queue, and were able to take an old rubber tire back to Stoatshead Hill before the sun had really risen. They walked back through Ottery St.\\n\\nCatchpole and up the damp lane toward the Burrow in the dawn light, talking very little because they were so exhausted, and thinking longingly of their breakfast. As they rounded the corner and the Burrow came into view, a cry echoed along the lane.\\n\\n\"Oh thank goodness, thank goodness!\"\\n\\nMrs. Weasley, who had evidently been waiting for them in the front yard, came running toward them, still wearing her bedroom slippers, her face pale and strained, a rolled�up copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in her hand.\\n\\n\"Arthur � I\\'ve been so worried � so worried�\"\\n\\nShe flung her arms around Mr. Weasley\\'s neck, and the Daily Prophet fell out of her limp hand onto the ground. Looking down, Harry saw the headline: SCENES OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP, complete with a twinkling black�and�white photograph of the Dark Mark over the treetops.\\n\\n\"You\\'re all right,\" Mrs. Weasley muttered distractedly, releasing Mr. Weasley and staring around at them all with red eyes, \"you\\'re alive. . . . Oh boys. .\\n\\nAnd to everybody\\'s surprise, she seized Fred and George and pulled them both into such a tight hug that their heads banged together.\\n\\n\"Ouch! Mum � you\\'re strangling us �\"\\n\\n\"I shouted at you before you left!\" Mrs. Weasley said, starting to sob. \"It\\'s all I\\'ve been thinking about! What if You�Know�Who had got you, and the last thing I ever said to you was that you didn\\'t get enough OW.L.s? Oh Fred. . . George. .\"\\n\\n\"Come on, now, Molly, we\\'re all perfectly okay,\" said Mr. Weasley soothingly, prising her off the twins and leading her back toward the house. \"Bill,\" he added in an undertone, \"pick up that paper, I want to see what it says. . .\"\\n\\nWhen they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen, and Hermione had made Mrs.\\n\\nWeasley a cup of very strong tea, into which Mr. Weasley insisted on pouring a shot of Ogdens Old Firewhiskey, Bill handed his father the newspaper. Mr.\\n\\nWeasley scanned the front page while Percy looked over his shoulder.\\n\\n\"I knew it,\" said Mr. Weasley heavily. \"Ministry blunders. . . culprits not apprehended. . . lax security. . . Dark wizards running unchecked... national disgrace. . . Who wrote this? Ah. . . of course. . . Rita Skeeter.\"\\n\\n\"That woman\\'s got it in for the Ministry of Magic!\" said Percy furiously. \"Last week she was saying we\\'re wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness, when we should be stamping out vampires! As if it wasn\\'t specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non�Wizard Part�Humans ��\"\\n\\n\"Do us a favor, Perce,\" said Bill, yawning, \"and shut up.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m mentioned,\" said Mr. Weasley, his eyes widening behind his glasses as he reached the bottom of the Daily Prophet article.\\n\\n\"Where?\" spluttered Mrs. Weasley, choking on her tea and whiskey. \"If I\\'d seen that, I\\'d have known you were alive!\"\\n\\n\"Not by name,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Listen to this: \\'If the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the Ministry ofMagic, they were sadly disappointed. A Ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the Dark Mark alleging that nobody had been hurt, but reflising to give any more information. Whether this statement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods an hour later, remains to be seen.\\' Oh really,\" said Mr. Weasley in exasperation, handing the paper to Percy. \"Nobody was hurt. What was I supposed to say? Rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods. . . well, there certainly will be rumors now she\\'s printed that.\"\\n\\nHe heaved a deep sigh. \"Molly, I\\'m going to have to go into the office; this is going to take some smoothing over.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll come with you, Father,\" said Percy importantly. \"Mr. Crouch will need all hands on deck. And I can give him my cauldron report in person.\"\\n\\nHe bustled out of the kitchen. Mrs. Weasley looked most upset. \"Arthur, you\\'re supposed to be on holiday! This hasn\\'t got anything to do with your office; surely they can handle this without you?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got to go, Molly,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I\\'ve made things worse. I\\'ll just change\\n\\ninto my robes and I\\'ll be off. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Weasley,\" said Harry suddenly, unable to contain himself, \"Hedwig hasn\\'t arrived with a letter for me, has she?\"\\n\\n\"Hedwig, dear?\" said Mrs. Weasley distractedly. \"No. . . no, there hasn\\'t been any post at all.\"\\n\\nRon and Hermione looked curiously at Harry. With a meaningful look at both of them he said, \"All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room, Ron?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah. . . think I will too,\" said Ron at once. \"Hermione?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she said quickly, and the three of them marched out of the kitchen and up the stairs.\\n\\n\"What\\'s up, Harry?\" said Ron, the moment they had closed the door of the attic room behind them.\\n\\n\"There\\'s something I haven\\'t told you,\" Harry said. \"On Saturday morning, I woke up with my scar hurting again.\"\\n\\nRon\\'s and Hermione\\'s reactions were almost exactly as Harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on Privet Drive. Hermione gasped and started making suggestions at once, mentioning a number of reference books, and everybody from Albus Dumbledore to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse. Ron simply looked dumbstruck.\\n\\n\"But � he wasn\\'t there, was he? You�Know�Who? I mean � last time your scar kept hurting, he was at Hogwarts, wasn\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure he wasn\\'t on Privet Drive,\" said Harry. \"But I was dreaming about him.. .\\n\\nhim and Peter � you know, Wormtail. I can\\'t remember all of it now, but they were plotting to kill...someone.\"\\n\\nHe had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying \"me,\" but couldn\\'t bring himself to make Hermione look any more horrified than she already did.\\n\\n\"It was only a dream,\" said Ron bracingly. \"Just a nightmare.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, but was it, though?\" said Harry, turning to look out of the window at the brightening sky. \"It\\'s weird, isn\\'t it?. . . My scar hurts, and three days later the Death Eaters are on the march, and Voldemort\\'s sign\\'s up in the sky again.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t � say � his � name!\" Ron hissed through gritted teeth.\\n\\n\"And remember what Professor Trelawney said?\" Harry went on, ignoring Ron.\\n\\n\"At the end of last year?\"\\n\\nProfessor Trelawney was their Divination teacher at Hogwarts. Hermione\\'s terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort.\\n\\n\"Oh Harry, you aren\\'t going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says?\"\\n\\n\"You weren\\'t there,\" said Harry. \"You didn\\'t hear her. This time was different. I told you, she went into a trance � a real one. And she said the Dark Lord would rise again. . . greater and more terrible than ever before. . . and he\\'d manage it because his servant was going to go back to him. . . and that night Wormtail escaped.\"\\n\\nThere was a silence in which Ron fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole in his Chudley Cannons bedspread.\\n\\n\"Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, Harry?\" Hermione asked. \"Are you expecting a letter?\"\\n\\n\"I told Sirius about my scar,\" said Harry, shrugging. \"I\\'m waiting for his answer.\"\\n\\n\"Good thinking!\" said Ron, his expression clearing. \"I bet Sirius\\'ll know what to do!\"\\n\\n\"I hoped he\\'d get back to me quickly,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"But we don\\'t know where Sirius is. . . he could be in Africa or somewhere, couldn\\'t he?\" said Hermione reasonably. \"Hedwig\\'s not going to manage that journey in a few days.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I know,\" said Harry, but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window at the Hedwig�free sky.\\n\\n\"Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry\" said Ron. \"Come on � three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play. .. . You can try out the Wronski Feint... .\"\\n\\n\"Ron,\" said Hermione, in an I�don\\'t�think�you\\'re�being�very�sensitive sort of voice, \"Harry doesn\\'t want to play Quidditch right now... . He\\'s worried, and he\\'s tired. . . . We all need to go to bed...\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I want to play Quidditch,\" said Harry suddenly. \"Hang on, I\\'ll get my Firebolt.\"\\n\\nHermione left the room, muttering something that sounded very much like \"Boys.\"\\n\\nNeither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much over the following week. Both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up, and returned well after dinner every night.\\n\\n\"It\\'s been an absolute uproar,\" Percy told them importantly the Sunday evening before they were due to return to Hogwarts. \"I\\'ve been putting out fires all week.\\n\\nPeople keep sending Howlers, and of course, if you don\\'t open a Howler straight away, it explodes. Scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinders.\"\\n\\n\"Why are they all sending Howlers?\" asked Ginny, who was mending her copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi with Spellotape on the rug in front of the living room fire.\\n\\n\"Complaining about security at the World Cup,\" said Percy. \"They want compensation for their ruined property. Mundungus Fletcher\\'s put in a claim for a twelve�bedroomed tent with en�suite Jacuzzi, but I\\'ve got his number. I know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner. Harry liked this clock. It was completely useless if you wanted to know the time, but otherwise very informative. It had nine golden hands, and each of them was engraved with one of the Weasley family\\'s names. There were no numerals around the face, but descriptions of where each family member might be. \"Home,\" \"school,\" and \"work\" were there, but there was also \"traveling,\" \"lost,\" \"hospital,\" \"prison,\" and, in the position where the number twelve would be on a normal clock, \"mortal peril.\"\\n\\nEight of the hands were currently pointing to the \"home\" position, but Mr.\\n\\nWeasley\\'s, which was the longest, was still pointing to \"work.\" Mrs. Weasley sighed.\\n\\n\"Your father hasn\\'t had to go into the office on weekends since the days of You� Know�Who,\" she said. \"They\\'re working him far too hard. His dinner\\'s going to be ruined if he doesn\\'t come home soon.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Father feels he\\'s got to make up for his mistake at the match, doesn\\'t he?\"\\n\\nsaid Percy. \"If truth be told, he was a tad unwise to make a public statement without clearing it with his Head of Department first �\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you dare blame your father for what that wretched Skeeter woman wrote!\"\\n\\nsaid Mrs. Weasley, flaring up at once.\\n\\n\"If Dad hadn\\'t said anything, old Rita would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the Ministry had commented,\" said Bill, who was playing chess with Ron. \"Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look good. Remember, she interviewed all the Gringotts\\' Charm Breakers once, and called me \\'a long�haired pillock\\'?\"\\n\\n\"Well, it is a bit long, dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley gently. \"If you\\'d just let me �\"\\n\\n\"No, Mum.\"\\n\\nRain lashed against the living room window. Hermione was immersed in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, copies of which Mrs. Weasley had bought for her, Harry, and Ron in Diagon Alley. Charlie was darning a fireproof balaclava.\\n\\nHarry was polishing his Firebolt, the broomstick servicing kit Hermione had given him for his thirteenth birthday open at his feet. Fred and George were sitting in a far corner, quills out, talking in whispers, their heads bent over a piece of parchment.\\n\\n\"What are you two up to?\" said Mrs. Weasley sharply, her eyes on the twins.\\n\\n\"Homework,\" said Fred vaguely.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be ridiculous, you\\'re still on holiday,\" said Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\n\"Yeah, we\\'ve left it a bit late,\" said George.\\n\\n\"You\\'re not by any chance writing out a new order form, are you?\" said Mrs.\\n\\nWeasley shrewdly. \"You wouldn\\'t be thinking of restarting Weasleys\\' Wizard Wheezes, by any chance?\"\\n\\n\"Now, Mum,\" said Fred, looking up at her, a pained look on his face. \"If the Hogwarts Express crashed tomorrow, and George and I died, how would you feel to know that the last thing we ever heard from you was an unfounded accusation?\"\\n\\nEveryone laughed, even Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\n\"Oh your father\\'s coming!\" she said suddenly, looking up at the clock again.\\n\\nMr. Weasley\\'s hand had suddenly spun from \"work\" to \"traveling\"; a second later it had shuddered to a halt on \"home\" with the others, and they heard him calling from the kitchen.\\n\\n\"Coming, Arthur!\" called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying out of the room.\\n\\nA few moments later, Mr. Weasley came into the warm living room carrying his dinner on a tray. He looked completely exhausted.\\n\\n\"Well, the fat\\'s really in the fire now,\" he told Mrs. Weasley as he sat down in an armchair near the hearth and toyed unenthusiastically with his somewhat shriveled cauliflower. \"Rita Skeeter\\'s been ferreting around all week, looking for more Ministry mess�ups to report. And now she\\'s found out about poor old Bertha going missing, so that\\'ll be the headline in the Prophet tomorrow. I told Bagman he should have sent someone to look for her ages ago.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks,\" said Percy swiftly.\\n\\n\"Crouch is very lucky Rita hasn\\'t found out about Winky,\" said Mr. Weasley irritably. \"There\\'d be a week\\'s worth of headlines in his house�elf being caught holding the wand that conjured the Dark Mark.\"\\n\\n\"I thought we were all agreed that that elf, while irresponsible, did not conjure the Mark?\" said Percy hotly.\\n\\n\"If you ask me, Mr. Crouch is very lucky no one at the Daily Prophet knows how mean he is to elves!\" said Hermione angrily.\\n\\n\"Now look here, Hermione!\" said Percy. \"A high�ranking Ministry official like Mr. Crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants �\"\\n\\n\"His slave, you mean!\" said Hermione, her voice rising passionately, \"because he didn\\'t pay Winky, did he?\"\\n\\n\"I think you\\'d all better go upstairs and check that you\\'ve packed properly!\" said Mrs. Weasley, breaking up the argument. \"Come on now, all of you. . . .\"\\n\\nHarry repacked his broomstick servicing kit, put his Firebolt over his shoulder, and went back upstairs with Ron. The rain sounded even louder at the top of the house, accompanied by loud whistlings and moans from the wind, not to mention sporadic howls from the ghoul who lived in the attic. Pigwidgeon began twittering and zooming around his cage when they entered. The sight of the half�packed trunks seemed to have sent him into a frenzy of excitement.\\n\\n\"Bung him some Owl Treats,\" said Ron, throwing a packet across to Harry. \"It might shut him up.\"\\n\\nHarry poked a few Owl Treats through the bars of Pigwidgeon\\'s cage, then turned to his trunk. Hedwig\\'s cage stood next to it, still empty.\\n\\n\"It\\'s been over a week,\" Harry said, looking at Hedwig\\'s deserted perch. \"Ron, you don\\'t reckon Sirius has been caught, do you?\"\\n\\n\"Nah, it would\\'ve been in the Daily Prophet,\" said Ron. \"The Ministry would want to show they\\'d caught someone, wouldn\\'t they?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I suppose. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Look, here\\'s the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon Alley. And she\\'s got some gold out of your vault for you. . . and she\\'s washed all your socks.\"\\n\\nHe heaved a pile of parcels onto Harry\\'s camp bed and dropped the money bag and a load of socks next to it. Harry started unwrapping the shopping. Apart from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, by Miranda Goshawk, he had a handful of new quills, a dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for his potion�making kit � he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna. He was just piling underwear into his cauldron when Ron made a loud noise of disgust behind him.\\n\\n\"What is that supposed to be?\"\\n\\nHe was holding up something that looked to Harry like a long, maroon velvet dress. It had a moldy�looking lace frill at the collar and matching lace cuffs.\\n\\nThere was a knock on the door, and Mrs. Weasley entered, carrying an armful of freshly laundered Hogwarts robes.\\n\\n\"Here you are,\" she said, sorting them into two piles. \"Now, mind you pack them properly so they don\\'t crease.\"\\n\\n\"Mum, you\\'ve given me Ginny\\'s new dress,\" said Ron, handing it out to her.\\n\\n\"Of course I haven\\'t,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"That\\'s for you. Dress robes.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Ron, looking horror�struck.\\n\\n\"Dress robes!\" repeated Mrs. Weasley. \"It says on your school list that you\\'re supposed to have dress robes this year. . . robes for formal occasions.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got to be kidding,\" said Ron in disbelief. \"I\\'m not wearing that, no way.\"\\n\\n\"Everyone wears them, Ron!\" said Mrs. Weasley crossly. \"They\\'re all like that!\\n\\nYour father\\'s got some for smart parties!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go starkers before I put that on,\" said Ron stubbornly.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be so silly,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"You\\'ve got to have dress robes, they\\'re on your list! I got some for Harry too. . . show him, Harry... .\"\\n\\nIn some trepidation, Harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed. It wasn\\'t as bad as he had expected, however; his dress robes didn\\'t have any lace on them at all � in fact, they were more or less the same as his school ones, except that they were bottle green instead of black.\\n\\n\"I thought they\\'d bring out the color of your eyes, dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley fondly.\\n\\n\"Well, they\\'re okay!\" said Ron angrily, looking at Harry\\'s robes. \"Why couldn\\'t I have some like that?\"\\n\\n\"Because. . . well, I had to get yours secondhand, and there wasn\\'t a lot of choice!\"\\n\\nsaid Mrs. Weasley, flushing.\\n\\nHarry looked away. He would willingly have split all the money in his Gringotts vault with the Weasleys, but he knew they would never take it.\\n\\n\"I\\'m never wearing them,\" Ron was saying stubbornly. \"Never.\"\\n\\n\"Fine,\" snapped Mrs. Weasley. \"Go naked. And, Harry, make sure you get a picture of him. Goodness knows I could do with a laugh.\"\\n\\nShe left the room, slamming the door behind her. There was a funny spluttering noise from behind them. Pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge Owl Treat.\\n\\n\"Why is everything I own rubbish?\" said Ron furiously, striding across the room to unstick Pigwidgeon\\'s beak.\\n\\nCHAPTER ELEVEN � ABOARD THE HOGWART EXPRESS\\n\\nThere was a definite end�of�the�holidays gloom in the air when Harry awoke next morning. Heavy rain was still splattering against the window as he got dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt; they would change into their school robes on the Hogwarts Express.\\n\\nHe, Ron, Fred, and George had just reached the first�floor landing on their way down to breakfast, when Mrs. Weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs, looking harassed.\\n\\n\"Arthur!\" she called up the staircase. \"Arthur! Urgent message from the Ministry!\"\\n\\nHarry flattened himself against the wall as Mr. Weasley came clattering past with his robes on back�to�front and hurtled out of sight. When Harry and the others entered the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers � \"I\\'ve got a quill here somewhere!\" � and Mr. Weasley bending over the fire, talking to � Harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were working properly.\\n\\nAmos Diggory\\'s head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large, bearded egg. It was talking very fast, completely unperturbed by the sparks flying around it and the flames licking its ears.\\n\\n\". . . Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting, so they went and called those what�d\\'you�call�\\'ems � please�men. Arthur, you\\'ve got to get over there ��\"\\n\\n\"Here!\" said Mrs. Weasley breathlessly, pushing a piece of parchment, a bottle of ink, and a crumpled quill into Mr. Weasley\\'s hands.\\n\\n\"� it\\'s a real stroke of luck I heard about it,\" said Mr. Diggory\\'s head. \"I had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls, and I found the Improper Use of Magic lot all setting off �� if Rita Skeeter gets hold of this one, Arthur ��\"\\n\\n\"What does Mad�Eye say happened?\" asked Mr. Weasley, unscrewing the ink bottle, loading up his quill, and preparing to take notes.\\n\\nMr. Diggory\\'s head rolled its eyes. \"Says he heard an intruder in his yard. Says he was creeping toward the house, but was ambushed by his dustbins.\"\\n\\n\"What did the dustbins do?\" asked Mr. Weasley, scribbling frantically.\\n\\n\"Made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere, as far as I can tell,\" said Mr. Diggory. \"Apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the please� men turned up �\"\\n\\nMr. Weasley groaned.\\n\\n\"And what about the intruder?\"\\n\\n\"Arthur, you know Mad�Eye,\" said Mr. Diggory\\'s head, rolling its eyes again.\\n\\n\"Someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night? More likely there\\'s a very shell�shocked cat wandering around somewhere, covered in potato peelings. But if the Improper Use of Magic lot get their hands on Mad�Eye, he\\'s had it �� think of his record �� we\\'ve got to get him off on a minor charge, something in your department �� what are exploding dustbins worth?\"\\n\\n\"Might be a caution,\" said Mr. Weasley, still writing very fast, his brow furrowed.\\n\\n\"Mad�Eye didn\\'t use his wand? He didn\\'t actually attack anyone?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach through the window,\" said Mr. Diggory, \"but they\\'ll have a job proving it, there aren\\'t any casualties.\"\\n\\n\"All right, I\\'m off,\" Mr. Weasley said, and he stuffed the parchment with his notes on it into his pocket and dashed out of the kitchen again.\\n\\nMr. Diggory\\'s head looked around at Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\n\"Sorry about this, Molly,\" it said, more calmly, \"bothering you so early and everything...but Arthur\\'s the only one who can get Mad�Eye off, and Mad�Eye\\'s supposed to be starting his new job today. Why he had to choose last night. .\"\\n\\n\"Never mind, Amos,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Sure you won\\'t have a bit of toast or anything before you go?\"\\n\\n\"Oh go on, then,\" said Mr. Diggory.\\n\\nMrs. Weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a stack on the kitchen table, put it into the fire tongs, and transferred it into Mr. Diggory\\'s mouth.\\n\\n\"Fanks,\" he said in a muffled voice, and then, with a small pop, vanished.\\n\\nHarry could hear Mr. Weasley calling hurried good�byes to Bill, Charlie, Percy, and the girls. Within five minutes, he was back in the kitchen, his robes on the right way now, dragging a comb through his hair.\\n\\n\"I\\'d better hurry � you have a good term, boys, said Mr. Weasley to Harry, Ron, and the twins, fastening a cloak over his shoulders and preparing to Disapparate.\\n\\n\"Molly, are you going to be all right taking the kids to King\\'s Cross?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I will,\" she said. \"You just look after Mad�Eye, we\\'ll be fine.\"\\n\\nAs Mr. Weasley vanished, Bill and Charlie entered the kitchen.\\n\\n\"Did someone say Mad�Eye?\" Bill asked. \"What\\'s he been up to now.\"\\n\\n\"He says someone tried to break into his house last night,\" said Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\n\"Mad�Eye Moody?\" said George thoughtfully, spreading marmalade on his toast.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t he that nutter �\"\\n\\n\"Your father thinks very highly of Mad�Eye Moody,\" said Mrs. Weasley sternly.\\n\\n\"Yeah, well, Dad collects plugs, doesn\\'t he?\" said Fred quietly as Mrs. Weasley left the room. \"Birds of a feather. . .\"\\n\\n\"Moody was a great wizard in his time,\" said Bill.\\n\\n\"He\\'s an old friend of Dumbledore\\'s, isn\\'t he?\" said Charlie.\\n\\n\"Dumbledore\\'s not what you\\'d call normal, though, is he?\" said Fred. \"I mean, I know he\\'s a genius and everything.. .\"\\n\\n\"Who is Mad�Eye?\" asked Harry.\\n\\n\"He\\'s retired, used to work at the Ministry,\" said Charlie. \"I met him once when Dad took me into work with him. He was an Auror � one of the best. . . a Dark wizard catcher,\" he added, seeing Harry\\'s blank look \"Half the cells in Azkaban are full because of him. He made himself loads of enemies, though. . . the families of people he caught, mainly. . . and I heard he\\'s been getting really paranoid in his old age. Doesn\\'t trust anyone anymore. Sees Dark wizards everywhere.\"\\n\\nBill and Charlie decided to come and see everyone off at King\\'s Cross station, but Percy, apologizing most profusely, said that he really needed to get to work.\\n\\n\"I just can\\'t justify taking more time off at the moment,\" he told them. \"Mr.\\n\\nCrouch is really starting to rely on me.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, you know what, Percy?\" said George seriously. \"I reckon he\\'ll know your name soon.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weasley had braved the telephone in the village post office to order three ordinary Muggle taxis to take them into London.\\n\\n\"Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us,\" Mrs. Weasley whispered to Harry as they stood in the rain�washed yard, watching the taxi drivers heaving six heavy Hogwarts trunks into their cars. \"But there weren\\'t any to spare. . . . Oh dear, they don\\'t look happy, do they?\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t like to tell Mrs. Weasley that Muggle taxi drivers rarely transported overexcited owls, and Pigwidgeon was making an earsplitting racket. Nor did it help that a number of Filibuster\\'s Fabulous No�Heat, Wet�Start Fireworks went off unexpectedly when Fred\\'s trunk sprang open, causing the driver carrying it to yell with fright and pain as Crookshanks clawed his way up the man\\'s leg.\\n\\nThe journey was uncomfortable, owing to the fact that they were jammed in the back of the taxis with their trunks. Crookshanks took quite a while to recover from the fireworks, and by the time they entered London, Harry, Ron, and Hermione\\n\\nwere all severely scratched. They were very relieved to get out at King\\'s Cross, even though the rain was coming down harder than ever, and they got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the station.\\n\\nHarry was used to getting onto platform nine and three�quarters by now. It was a simple matter of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways through it. . . and as they did so, platform nine and three�quarters materialized in front of them.\\n\\nThe Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there, clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their luggage in a compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back down onto the platform to say good�bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.\\n\\n\"I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,\" said Charlie, grinning, as he hugged Ginny good�bye.\\n\\n\"Why?\" said Fred keenly.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll see,\" said Charlie. \"Just don\\'t tell Percy I mentioned it.. . it\\'s \\'classified information, until such time as the Ministry sees fit to release it,\\' after all.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this year,\" said Bill, hands in his pockets, looking almost wistfully at the train.\\n\\n\"Why?\" said George impatiently.\\n\\n\"You\\'re going to have an interesting year,\" said Bill, his eyes twinkling. \"I might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it.\"\\n\\n\"A bit of what?\" said Ron.\\n\\nBut at that moment, the whistle blew, and Mrs. Weasley chivvied them toward the train doors.\\n\\n\"Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs. Weasley,\" said Hermione as they climbed on board, closed the door, and leaned out of the window to talk to her.\\n\\n\"Yeah, thanks for everything, Mrs. Weasley,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Oh it was my pleasure, dears,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"I\\'d invite you for Christmas, but...well, I expect you\\'re all going to want to stay at Hogwarts, what with. . . one thing and another.\"\\n\\n\"Mum!\" said Ron irritably. \"What d\\'you three know that we don\\'t?\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll find out this evening, I expect,\" said Mrs. Weasley, smiling. \"It\\'s going to be very exciting � mind you, I\\'m very glad they\\'ve changed the rules �\"\\n\\n\"What rules?\" said Harry, Ron, Fred, and George together.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you. . . . Now, behave, won\\'t you? Won\\'t you, Fred? And you, George?\"\\n\\nThe pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move.\\n\\n\"Tell us what\\'s happening at Hogwarts!\" Fred bellowed out of the window as Mrs.\\n\\nWeasley, Bill, and Charlie sped away from them. \"What rules are they changing?\"\\n\\nBut Mrs. Weasley only smiled and waved. Before the train had rounded the corner, she, Bill, and Charlie had Disapparated.\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione went back to their compartment. The thick rain splattering the windows made it very difficult to see out of them. Ron undid his trunk, pulled out his maroon dress robes, and flung them over Pigwidgeon\\'s cage to muffle his hooting.\\n\\n\"Bagman wanted to tell us what\\'s happening at Hogwarts,\" he said grumpily, sitting down next to Harry. \"At the World Cup, remember? But my own mother won\\'t say. Wonder what ��\"\\n\\n\"Shh!\" Hermione whispered suddenly, pressing her finger to her lips and pointing toward the compartment next to theirs. Harry and Ron listened, and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door.\\n\\n\". . . Father actually considered sending me to Durmstrang rather than Hogwarts, you know. He knows the headmaster, you see. Well, you know his opinion of Dumbledore � the man\\'s such a Mudblood�lover � and Durmstrang doesn\\'t admit that sort of riffraff. But Mother didn\\'t like the idea of me going to school so far away. Father says Durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than Hogwarts about the Dark Arts. Durmstrang students actually learn them, not just the defense rubbish we do. . . .\"\\n\\nHermione got up, tiptoed to the compartment door, and slid it shut, blocking out Malfoy\\'s voice.\\n\\n\"So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him, does he?\" she said angrily. \"I wish he had gone, then we wouldn\\'t have to put up with him.\"\\n\\n\"Durmstrang\\'s another wizarding school?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Hermione sniffily, \"and it\\'s got a horrible reputation. According to An Appraisal ofMagical Education in Europe, it puts a lot of emphasis on the Dark Arts.\"\\n\\n\"I think I\\'ve heard of it,\" said Ron vaguely. \"Where is it? What country?\"\\n\\n\"Well, nobody knows, do they?\" said Hermione, raising her eyebrows.\\n\\n\"Er � why not?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"There\\'s traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools.\\n\\nDurmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets,\" said Hermione matter�of�factly.\\n\\n\"Come off it,\" said Ron, starting to laugh. \"Durmstrang\\'s got to be about the same size as Hogwarts �� how are you going to hide a great big castle?\"\\n\\n\"But Hogwarts is hidden,\" said Hermione, in surprise. \"Everyone knows that.. .\\n\\nwell, everyone who\\'s read Hogwarts, A History, anyway.\"\\n\\n\"Just you, then,\" said Ron. \"So go on � how d\\'you hide a place like Hogwarts?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s bewitched,\" said Hermione. \"If a Muggle looks at it, all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying DANGER, DO NOT ENTER, UNSAFE.\"\\n\\n\"So Durmstrang\\'ll just look like a ruin to an outsider too?\"\\n\\n\"Maybe,\" said Hermione, shrugging, \"or it might have Muggle�repelling charms on it, like the World Cup stadium. And to keep foreign wizards from finding it, they\\'ll have made it Unplottable �\"\\n\\n\"Come again?\"\\n\\n\"Well, you can enchant a building so it\\'s impossible to plot on a map, can\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Er. . . if you say so,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north,\" said Hermione thoughtfully. \"Somewhere very cold, because they\\'ve got fur capes as part of their uniforms.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, think of the possibilities,\" said Ron dreamily. \"It would\\'ve been so easy to push Malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an accident... . Shame his mother likes him. . . .\"\\n\\nThe rain became heavier and heavier as the train moved farther north. The sky was so dark and the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by midday. The lunch trolley came rattling along the corridor, and Harry bought a large stack of Cauldron Cakes for them to share.\\n\\nSeveral of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed, including Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom, a round�faced, extremely forgetful boy who had been brought up by his formidable witch of a grandmother. Seamus was still wearing his Ireland rosette. Some of its magic\\n\\nseemed to be wearing off now; it was still squeaking \"Troy � Mullet � Moran!\" but in a very feeble and exhausted sort of way. After half an hour or so, Hermione, growing tired of the endless Quidditch talk, buried herself once more in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying to learn a Summoning Charm.\\n\\nNeville listened jealously to the others\\' conversation as they relived the Cup match.\\n\\n\"Gran didn\\'t want to go,\" he said miserably. \"Wouldn\\'t buy tickets. It sounded amazing though.\"\\n\\n\"It was,\" said Ron. \"Look at this, Neville. . .\\n\\nHe rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out the miniature figure of Viktor Krum.\\n\\n\"Oh wow,\" said Neville enviously as Ron tipped Krum onto his pudgy hand.\\n\\n\"We saw him right up close, as well,\" said Ron. \"We were in the Top Box �\"\\n\\n\"For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.\"\\n\\nDraco Malfoy had appeared in the doorway. Behind him stood Crabbe and Goyle, his enormous, thuggish cronies, both of whom appeared to have grown at least a foot during the summer. Evidently they had overheard the conversation through the compartment door, which Dean and Seamus had left ajar.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t remember asking you to join us, Malfoy,\" said Harry coolly.\\n\\n\"Weasley. . . what is that?\" said Malfoy, pointing at Pigwidgeon\\'s cage. A sleeve of Ron\\'s dress robes was dangling from it, swaying with the motion of the train, the moldy lace cuff very obvious.\\n\\nRon made to stuff the robes out of sight, but Malfoy was too quick for him; he seized the sleeve and pulled.\\n\\n\"Look at this!\" said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up Ron\\'s robes and showing Crabbe and Goyle, \"Weasley, you weren\\'t thinking of wearing these, were you? I mean � they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety. . .\\n\\n\"Eat dung, Malfoy!\" said Ron, the same color as the dress robes as he snatched them back out of Malfoy\\'s grip. Malfoy howled with derisive laughter; Crabbe and Goyle guffawed stupidly.\\n\\n\"So. . . going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name? There\\'s money involved as well, you know. . . you\\'d be able to afford some decent robes if you won. . . .\"\\n\\n\"What are you talking about?\" snapped Ron.\\n\\n\\'Are you going to enter?\\' Malfoy repeated. \"I suppose you will, Potter? You never miss a chance to show off, do you?\"\\n\\n\"Either explain what you\\'re on about or go away, Malfoy,\" said Hermione testily, over the top of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4.\\n\\nA gleeful smile spread across Malfoy\\'s pale face \"Don\\'t tell me you don\\'t know?\" he said delightedly. \"You\\'ve got a father and brother at the Ministry and you don\\'t even know? My God, my father told me about it ages ago. . . heard it from Cornelius Fudge. But then, Father\\'s always associated with the top people at the Ministry. . . . Maybe your father\\'s too junior to know about it, Weasley. . . yes. . . they probably don\\'t talk about important stuff in front of him. . . .\"\\n\\nLaughing once more, Malfoy beckoned to Crabbe and Goyle, and the three of them disappeared.\\n\\nRon got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard behind them that the glass shattered.\\n\\n\"Ron!\" said Hermione reproachfully, and she pulled out her wand, muttered \"Reparo!\" and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the door.\\n\\n\"Well.. . making it look like he knows everything and we don\\'t.. . .\" Ron snarled.\\n\\n\"Father\\'s always associated with the top peopie at the Ministry.\\'. . . Dad could\\'ve got a promotion any time... he just likes it where he is. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Of course he does,\" said Hermione quietly. \"Don\\'t let Malfoy get to you, Ron �\"\\n\\n\"Him! Get to me!? As if!\" said Ron, picking up one of the remaining Cauldron Cakes and squashing it into a pulp.\\n\\nRon\\'s bad mood continued for the rest of the journey. He didn\\'t talk much as they changed into their school robes, and was still glowering when the Hogwarts Express slowed down at last and finally stopped in the pitch�darkness of Hogsmeade station.\\n\\nAs the train doors opened, there was a rumble of thunder overhead. Hermione bundled up Crookshanks in her cloak and Ron left his dress robes over Pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads bent and eyes narrowed against the downpour. The rain was now coming down so thick and fast that it was as though buckets of ice�cold water were being emptied repeatedly over their heads.\\n\\n\"Hi, Hagrid!\" Harry yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the platform.\\n\\n\"All righ\\', Harry?\" Hagrid bellowed back, waving. \"See yeh at the feast if we don\\' drown!\"\\n\\nFirst years traditionally reached Hogwarts Castle by sailing across the lake with Hagrid.\\n\\n\"Oooh, I wouldn\\'t fancy crossing the lake in this weather,\" said Hermione fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the rest of the crowd. A hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them outside the station. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville climbed gratefully into one of them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great lurch, the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the track toward Hogwarts Castle.\\n\\nCHAPTER TWELVE � THE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT\\n\\nThrough the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what was fast becoming a gale. Leaning against the window, Harry could see Hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain.\\n\\nLightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps. People who had occupied the carriages in front were already hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville jumped down from their carriage and dashed up the steps too, looking up only when they were safely inside the cavernous, torch�lit entrance hall, with its magnificent marble staircase.\\n\\n\"Blimey,\" said Ron, shaking his head and sending water everywhere, \"if that keeps up the lake\\'s going to overflow. I\\'m soak � ARRGH!\"\\n\\nA large, red, water�filled balloon had dropped from out of the ceiling onto Ron\\'s head and exploded. Drenched and sputtering, Ron staggered sideways into Harry, just as a second water bomb dropped � narrowly missing Hermione, it burst at Harry\\'s feet, sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into his socks. People all around them shrieked and started pushing one another in their efforts to get out of the line of fire. Harry looked up and saw, floating twenty feet above them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man in a bell�covered hat and orange bow tie, his wide, malicious face contorted with concentration as he took aim again.\\n\\n\"PEEVES!\" yelled an angry voice. \"Peeves, come down here at ONCE!\"\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress and head of Gryffindor House, had come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor and grabbed Hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling.\\n\\n\"Ouch � sorry, Miss Granger �\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right, Professor!\" Hermione gasped, massaging her throat.\\n\\n\"Peeves, get down here NOW!\" barked Professor McGonagall, straightening her pointed hat and glaring upward through her square�rimmed spectacles.\\n\\n\"Not doing nothing!\" cackled Peeves, lobbing a water bomb at several fifth�year girls, who screamed and dived into the Great Hall. \"Already wet, aren\\'t they!\\n\\nLittle squirts! Wheeeeeeeeee!\" And he aimed another bomb at a group of second years who had just arrived.\\n\\n\"I shall call the headmaster!\" shouted Professor McGonagall. \"I\\'m warning you, Peeves �\"\\n\\nPeeves stuck out his tongue, threw the last of his water bombs into the air, and zoomed off up the marble staircase, cackling insanely.\\n\\n\"Well, move along, then!\" said Professor McGonagall sharply to the bedraggled crowd. \"Into the Great Hall, come on!\"\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione slipped and slid across the entrance hall and through the double doors on the right, Ron muttering furiously under his breath as he pushed his sopping hair off his face.\\n\\nThe Great Hall looked its usual splendid self, decorated for the start�of�term feast.\\n\\nGolden plates and goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and hundreds of candles, floating over the tables in midair. The four long House tables were packed with chattering students; at the top of the Hall, the staff sat along one side of a fifth table, facing their pupils. It was much warmer in here. Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked past the Slytherins, the Ravenclaws, and the Hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of the Hall, next to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost. Pearly white and semitransparent, Nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet, but with a particularly large ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking extra�festive, and insuring that his head didn\\'t wobble too much on his partially severed neck.\\n\\n\"Good evening,\" he said, beaming at them.\\n\\n\"Says who?\" said Harry, taking off his sneakers and emptying them of water.\\n\\n\"Hope they hurry up with the Sorting. I\\'m starving.\"\\n\\nThe Sorting of the new students into Houses took place at the start of every school year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn\\'t been present at one since his own. He was quite looking forward to it. Just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table.\\n\\n\"Hiya, Harry!\"\\n\\nIt was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero.\\n\\n\"Hi, Colin,\" said Harry warily.\\n\\n\"Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother\\'s starting! My brother Dennis!\"\\n\\n\"Er � good,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"He\\'s really excited!\" said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat. \"I just hope he\\'s in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"Er � yeah, all right,\" said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and Nearly Headless Nick. \"Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don\\'t they?\"\\n\\nhe said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had been put into Gryffindor.\\n\\n\"Oh no, not necessarily,\" said Hermione. \"Parvati Patil\\'s twin\\'s in Ravenclaw, and they\\'re identical. You\\'d think they\\'d be together, wouldn\\'t you?\"\\n\\nHarry looked up at the staff table. There seemed to be rather more empty seats there than usual. Hagrid, of course, was still fighting his way across the lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervising the drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too, and Harry couldn\\'t think who else was missing.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?\" said Hermione, who was also looking up at the teachers.\\n\\nThey had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had lasted more than three terms. Harry\\'s favorite by far had been Professor Lupin, who had resigned last year. He looked up and down the staff table. There was definitely no new face there.\\n\\n\"Maybe they couldn\\'t get anyone!\" said Hermione, looking anxious.\\n\\nHarry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside Professor Sprout, the Herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray hair. She was talking to Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department. On Professor Sinistra\\'s other side was the sallow�faced, hook�nosed, greasy�haired Potions master, Snape � Harry\\'s least favorite person at Hogwarts. Harry\\'s loathing of Snape was matched only by Snape\\'s hatred of him, a hatred which had, if possible, intensified last year, when Harry had helped Sirius escape right under Snape\\'s overlarge nose � Snape and Sirius had been enemies since their own school days.\\n\\nOn Snape\\'s other side was an empty seat, which Harry guessed was Professor McGonagall\\'s. Next to it, and in the very center of the table, sat Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, his sweeping silver hair and beard shining in the candlelight, his magnificent deep green robes embroidered with many stars and moons. The tips of Dumbledore\\'s long, thin fingers were together and he was resting his chin upon them, staring up at the ceiling through his half�moon spectacles as though lost in thought. Harry glanced up at the ceiling too. It was enchanted to look like the sky outside, and he had never seen it look this stormy.\\n\\nBlack and purple clouds were swirling across it, and as another thunderclap sounded outside, a fork of lightning flashed across it.\\n\\n\"Oh hurry up,\" Ron moaned, beside Harry, \"I could eat a hippogriff.\"\\n\\nThe words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the Great Hall opened and silence fell. Professor McGonagall was leading a long line of first years up to the top of the Hall. If Harry, Ron, and Hermione were wet, it was nothing to how these first years looked. They appeared to have swum across the lake rather than sailed. All of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school � all of them except the smallest of the lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was wrapped in what Harry recognized as Hagrid\\'s moleskin overcoat. The coat was so big for him that it hooked as though he were draped in a furry black\\n\\ncircus tent. His small face protruded from over the collar, looking almost painfully excited. When he had lined up with his terrified�looking peers, he caught Colin Creevey\\'s eye, gave a double thumbs�up, and mouthed, I fell in the lake! He looked positively delighted about it.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall now placed a three�legged stool on the ground before the first years and, on top of it, an extremely old, dirty patched wizard\\'s hat. The first years stared at it. So did everyone else. For a moment, there was silence. Then a long tear near the brim opened wide like a mouth, and the hat broke into song:\\n\\nA thousand years or more ago, When I was newly sewn, There lived four wizards of renown, Whose names are still well known:\\n\\nBold Gryffindor, from wild moor, Fair Ravenclaw, from glen, Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad, Shrewd Slytherin, from fin.\\n\\nThey shared a wish, a hope, a dream, They hatched a daring plan To educate young sorcerers Thus Hogwarts School began.\\n\\nNow each of these four founders Formed their own house, for each Did value different virtues In the ones they had to teach.\\n\\nBy Gryffindor, the bravest were Prized far beyond the rest; For Ravenclaw, the cleverest Would always be the best; For Hufflepuff, hard workers were Most worthy of admission;\\n\\nAnd power�hungry Slytherin Loved those of great ambition.\\n\\nWhile still alive they did divide Their favorites from the throng, Yet how to pick the worthy ones When they were dead and gone!\\n\\n\\'Twas Gryffindor who found the way, He whipped me off his head The founders put some brains in me So I could choose instead!\\n\\nNow slip me snug about your ears, I\\'ve never yet been wrong, I\\'ll have a look inside your mind And tell where you belong!\\n\\nThe Great Hall rang with applause as the Sorting Hat finished.\\n\\n\"That\\'s not the song it sang when it Sorted us,\" said Harry, clapping along with everyone else.\\n\\n\"Sings a different one every year,\" said Ron. \"It\\'s got to be a pretty boring life, hasn\\'t it, being a hat? I suppose it spends all year making up the next one.\"\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall was now unrolling a large scroll of parchment.\\n\\n\"When I call out your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool,\" she told the first years. \"When the hat announces your House, you will go and sit at the appropriate table.\\n\\n\"Ackerley, Stewart!\"\\n\\nA boy walked forward, visibly trembling from head to foot, picked up the Sorting Hat, put it on, and sat down on the stool.\\n\\n\"RAVENCLAW!\" shouted the hat.\\n\\nStewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the Ravenclaw table, where everyone was applauding him. Harry caught a glimpse of Cho, the Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as he sat down. For a fleeting second, Harry had a strange desire to join the Ravenclaw table too.\\n\\n\"Baddock, Malcolm!\"\\n\\n\"SLYTHERIN!\"\\n\\nThe table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; Harry could see Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins. Harry wondered whether Baddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other. Fred and George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat down.\\n\\n\"Branstone, Eleanor!\"\\n\\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\"\\n\\n\"Cauldwell, Owen!\"\\n\\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\"\\n\\n\"Creevey, Dennis!\"\\n\\nTiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over Hagrid\\'s moleskin, just as Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers\\' table.\\n\\nAbout twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad, Hagrid, with his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming � a misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature. He winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table and watched Dennis Creevey putting on the Sorting Hat. The rip at the brim opened wide�� � \"GRYFFINDOR!\" the hat shouted.\\n\\nHagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis Creevey, beaming widely, took off the hat, placed it back on the stool, and hurried over to join his brother.\\n\\n\"Colin, I fell in!\" he said shrilly, throwing himself into an empty seat. \"It was brilliant! And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat!\"\\n\\n\"Cool!\" said Colin, just as excitedly. \"It was probably the giant squid, Dennis!\"\\n\\n\"Wow!\" said Dennis, as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope for more than being thrown into a storm�tossed, fathoms�deep lake, and pushed out of it again by a giant sea monster.\\n\\n\"Dennis! Dennis! See that boy down there? The one with the black hair and glasses? See him? Know who he is, Dennis?\"\\n\\nHarry looked away, staring very hard at the Sorting Hat, now Sorting Emma Dobbs.\\n\\nThe Sorting continued; boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on their faces moving one by one to the three�legged stool, the line dwindling slowly as\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall passed the L\\'s.\\n\\n\"Oh hurry up,\" Ron moaned, massaging his stomach.\\n\\n\"Now, Ron, the Sorting\\'s much more important than food,\" said Nearly Headless Nick as \"Madley, Laura!\" became a Hufflepuff.\\n\\n\"Course it is, if you\\'re dead,\" snapped Ron.\\n\\n\"I do hope this year\\'s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, applauding as \"McDonald, Natalie!\" joined the Gryffindor table. \"We don\\'t want to break our winning streak, do we?\"\\n\\nGryffindor had won the Inter�House Championship for the last three years in a row.\\n\\n\"Pritchard, Graham!\"\\n\\n\"SLYTHERIN!\"\\n\\n\"Quirke, Orla!\"\\n\\n\"RAVENCLAW!\"\\n\\nAnd finally, with \"Whitby, Kevin!\" (\"HUFFLEPUFF!\"), the Sorting ended.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall picked up the hat and the stool and carried them away.\\n\\n\"About time,\" said Ron, seizing his knife and fork and looking expectantly at his golden plate.\\n\\nProfessor Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was smiling around at the students, his arms opened wide in welcome.\\n\\n\"I have only two words to say to you,\" he told them, his deep voice echoing around the Hall. \"Tuck in.\"\\n\\n\"Hear, hear!\" said Harry and Ron loudly as the empty dishes filled magically before their eyes.\\n\\nNearly Headless Nick watched mournfully as Harry, Ron, and Hermione loaded their own plates.\\n\\n\"Aaah, \\'at\\'s be\\'er,\" said Ron, with his mouth full of mashed potato.\\n\\n\"You\\'re lucky there\\'s a feast at all tonight, you know,\" said Nearly Headless Nick.\\n\\n\"There was trouble in the kitchens earlier.\"\\n\\n\"Why? Wha\\' \\'appened?\" said Harry, through a sizable chunk of steak.\\n\\n\"Peeves, of course,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, shaking his head, which wobbled dangerously. He pulled his ruff a little higher up on his neck. \"The usual argument, you know. He wanted to attend the feast � well, it\\'s quite out of the question, you\\n\\nknow what he\\'s like, utterly uncivilized, can\\'t see a plate of food without throwing it. We held a ghost\\'s council � the Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance � but most wisely, in my opinion, the Bloody Baron put his foot down.\"\\n\\nThe Bloody Baron was the Slytherin ghost, a gaunt and silent specter covered in silver bloodstains. He was the only person at Hogwarts who could really control Peeves.\\n\\n\"Yeah, we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about something,\" said Ron darkly.\\n\\n\"So what did he do in the kitchens?\"\\n\\n\"Oh the usual,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, shrugging. \"Wreaked havoc and mayhem. Pots and pans everywhere. Place swimming in soup. Terrified the house� elves out of their wits��\"\\n\\nClang.\\n\\nHermione had knocked over her golden goblet. Pumpkin juice spread steadily over the tablecloth, staining several feet of white linen orange, but Hermione paid no attention.\\n\\n\"There are house�elves here?\" she said, staring, horror�struck, at Nearly Headless Nick. \"Here at Hogwarts?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, looking surprised at her reaction. \"The largest number in any dwelling in Britain, I believe. Over a hundred.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve never seen one!\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"Well, they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day, do they?\" said Nearly Headless Nick. \"They come out at night to do a bit of cleaning.. . see to the fires and so on..\\n\\n. . I mean, you\\'re not supposed to see them, are you? That\\'s the mark of a good house�elf, isn\\'t it, that you don\\'t know it\\'s there?\"\\n\\nHermione stared at him.\\n\\n\"But they get paid?\" she said. \"They get holidays, don\\'t they? And � and sick leave, and pensions, and everything?\"\\n\\nNearly Headless Nick chortled so much that his ruff slipped and his head flopped off, dangling on the inch or so of ghostly skin and muscle that still attached it to his neck.\\n\\n\"Sick leave and pensions?\" he said, pushing his head back onto his shoulders and securing it once more with his ruff. \"House�elves don\\'t want sick leave and pensions!\"\\n\\nHermione looked down at her hardly touched plate of food, then put her knife and fork down upon it and pushed it away from her.\\n\\n\"Oh c\\'mon, \\'Er�my�knee,\" said Ron, accidentally spraying Harry with bits of\\n\\nYorkshire pudding. \"Oops �� sorry, \\'Arry ��\" He swallowed. \"You won\\'t get them sick leave by starving yourself!\"\\n\\n\"Slave labor,\" said Hermione, breathing hard through her nose. \"That\\'s what made this dinner. Slave labor.\"\\n\\nAnd she refused to eat another bite.\\n\\nThe rain was still drumming heavily against the high, dark glass. Another clap of thunder shook the windows, and the stormy ceiling flashed, illuminating the golden plates as the remains of the first course vanished and were replaced, instantly, with puddings.\\n\\n\"Treacle tart, Hermione!\" said Ron, deliberately wafting its smell toward her.\\n\\n\"Spotted dick, look! Chocolate gateau!\"\\n\\nBut Hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of Professor McGonagall that he gave up.\\n\\nWhen the puddings too had been demolished, and the last crumbs had faded off the plates, leaving them sparkling clean, Albus Dumbledore got to his feet again.\\n\\nThe buzz of chatter filling the Hall ceased almost at once, so that only the howling wind and pounding rain could be heard.\\n\\n\"So!\" said Dumbledore, smiling around at them all. \"Now that we are all fed and watered,\" (\"Hmph!\" said Hermione) \"I must once more ask for your attention, while I give out a few notices.\\n\\n\"Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include Screaming Yo�yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever�Bashing Boomerangs. The full list comprises some four hundred and thirty�seven items, I believe, and can be viewed in Mr. Filch\\'s office, if anybody would like to check it.\"\\n\\nThe corners of Dumbledore\\'s mouth twitched. He continued, \"As ever, I would like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is out�of�bounds to students, as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below third year.\\n\\n\"It is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter�House Quidditch Cup will not take place this year.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" Harry gasped. He looked around at Fred and George, his fellow members of the Quidditch team. They were mouthing soundlessly at Dumbledore, apparently too appalled to speak. Dumbhedore went on, \"This is due to an event that will be starting in October, and continuing throughout the school year, taking up much of the teachers\\' time and energy � but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely. I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts �\"\\n\\nBut at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors of the Great Hall banged open.\\n\\nA man stood in the doorway, leaning upon a long staff, shrouded in a black traveling cloak. Every head in the Great Hall swiveled toward the stranger, suddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning that flashed across the ceiling.\\n\\nHe lowered his hood, shook out a long mane of grizzled, dark gray hair, then began to walk up toward the teachers\\' table.\\n\\nA dull clunk echoed through the Hall on his every other step. He reached the end of the top table, turned right, and limped heavily toward Dumbledore. Another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling. Hermione gasped.\\n\\nThe lightning had thrown the man\\'s face into sharp relief, and it was a face unlike any Harry had ever seen. It looked as though it had been carved out of weathered wood by someone who had only the vaguest idea of what human faces are supposed to look like, and was none too skilled with a chisel. Every inch of skin seemed to be scarred. The mouth looked like a diagonal gash, and a large chunk of the nose was missing. But it was the man\\'s eyes that made him frightening.\\n\\nOne of them was small, dark, and beady. The other was large, round as a coin, and a vivid, electric blue. The blue eye was moving ceaselessly, without blinking, and was rolling up, down, and from side to side, quite independently of the normal eye � and then it rolled right over, pointing into the back of the man\\'s head, so that all they could see was whiteness.\\n\\nThe stranger reached Dumbledore. He stretched out a hand that was as badly scarred as his face, and Dumbhedore shook it, muttering words Harry couldn\\'t hear. He seemed to be making some inquiry of the stranger, who shook his head unsmilingly and replied in an undertone. Dumbledore nodded and gestured the man to the empty seat on his right�hand side.\\n\\nThe stranger sat down, shook his mane of dark gray hair out of his face, pulled a plate of sausages toward him, raised it to what was left of his nose, and sniffed it.\\n\\nHe then took a small knife out of his pocket, speared a sausage on the end of it, and began to eat. His normal eye was fixed upon the sausages, but the blue eye was still darting restlessly around in its socket, taking in the Hall and the students.\\n\\n\"May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?\" said Dumbledore brightly into the silence. \"Professor Moody.\"\\n\\nIt was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause, but none of the staff or students chapped except Dumbledore and Hagrid, who both put their hands together and applauded, but the sound echoed dismally into the silence, and they stopped fairly quickly. Everyone else seemed too transfixed by Moody\\'s bizarre appearance to do more than stare at him.\\n\\n\"Moody?\" Harry muttered to Ron. \"Mad�Eye Moody? The one your dad went to help this morning?\"\\n\\n\"Must be,\" said Ron in a low, awed voice.\\n\\n\"What happened to him?\" Hermione whispered. \"What happened to his face?\"\\n\\n\"Dunno,\" Ron whispered back, watching Moody with fascination.\\n\\nMoody seemed totally indifferent to his less�than�warm welcome. Ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in front of him, he reached again into his traveling cloak, pulled out a hip flask, and took a long draught from it. As he lifted his arm to drink, his cloak was pulled a few inches from the ground, and Harry saw, below the table, several inches of carved wooden leg, ending in a clawed foot.\\n\\nDumbledore cleared his throat.\\n\\n\"As I was saying,\" he said, smiling at the sea of students before him, all of whom were still gazing transfixed at Mad�Eye Moody, \"we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event that has not been held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re JOKING!\" said Fred Weasley loudly.\\n\\nThe tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody\\'s arrival suddenly broke.\\n\\nNearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.\\n\\n\"I am not joking, Mr. Weasley,\" he said, \"though now that you mention it, I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a leprechaun who all go into a bar.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.\\n\\n\"Er � but maybe this is not the time.. . no. . .\" said Dumbledore, \"where was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament. . . well, some of you will not know what this tournament involves, so I hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.\\n\\n\"The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years, and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities � until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued.\"\\n\\n\"Death toll?\" Hermione whispered, looking alarmed. But her anxiety did not seem to be shared by the majority of students in the Hall; many of them were whispering excitedly to one another, and Harry himself was far more interested in hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had happened hundreds of years ago.\\n\\n\"There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the tournament,\"\\n\\nDumbledore continued, \"none of which has been very successful. However, our own departments of International Magical Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger.\\n\\n\"The heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their short�listed contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m going for it!\" Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At every House table, Harry could see people either gazing raptly at Dumbledore, or else whispering fervently to their neighbors. But then Dumbledore spoke again, and the Hall quieted once more.\\n\\n\"Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts,\"\\n\\nhe said, \"the heads of the participating schools, along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year. Only students who are of age � that is to say, seventeen years or older � will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration. This\" �� Dumbledore raised his voice slightly, for several people had made noises of outrage at these words, and the Weasley twins were suddenly looking furious � \"is a measure we feel is necessary, given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hog�warts champion.\"\\n\\nHis light blue eyes twinkled as they flickered over Fred\\'s and George\\'s mutinous faces. \"I therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen.\\n\\n\"The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October and remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us, and will give your whole�hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected.\\n\\nAnd now, it is late, and I know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! Chop chop!\"\\n\\nDumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad�Eye Moody. There was a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet and swarmed toward the double doors into the entrance hall.\\n\\n\"They can\\'t do that!\" said George Weasley, who had not joined the crowd moving toward the door, but was standing up and glaring at Dumbledore. \"We\\'re seventeen in April, why can\\'t we have a shot?\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re not stopping me entering,\" said Fred stubbornly, also scowling at the top table. \"The champions\\'ll get to do all sorts of stuff you\\'d never be allowed to do normally. And a thousand Galleons prize money!\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron, a faraway look on his face. \"Yeah, a thousand Galleons. . .\"\\n\\n\"Come on,\" said Hermione, \"we\\'ll be the only ones left here if you don\\'t move.\"\\n\\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George set off for the entrance hall, Fred and George debating the ways in which Dumbledore might stop those who were under seventeen from entering the tournament.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s this impartial judge who\\'s going to decide who the champions are?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Dunno,\" said Fred, \"but it\\'s them we\\'ll have to fool. I reckon a couple of drops of Aging Potion might do it, George.. .\"\\n\\n\"Dumbledore knows you\\'re not of age, though,\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Yeah, but he\\'s not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?\" said Fred shrewdly. \"Sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter, he\\'ll choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are. Dumbledore\\'s trying to stop us giving our names.\"\\n\\n\"People have died, though!\" said Hermione in a worried voice as they walked through a door concealed behind a tapestry and started up another, narrower staircase.\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Fred airily, \"but that was years ago, wasn\\'t it? Anyway, where\\'s the fun without a bit of risk? Hey, Ron, what if we find out how to get \\'round Dumbledore? Fancy entering?\"\\n\\n\"What d\\'you reckon?\" Ron asked Harry. \"Be cool to enter, wouldn\\'t it? But I s\\'pose they might want someone older.... Dunno if we\\'ve learned enough.. .\\n\\n\"I definitely haven\\'t,\" came Nevihle\\'s gloomy voice from behind Fred and George.\\n\\n\"I expect my gran\\'d want me to try, though. She\\'s always going on about how I should be upholding the family honor. I\\'ll just have to �� oops. . .\"\\n\\nNeville\\'s foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the staircase. There were many of these trick stairs at Hogwarts; it was second nature to most of the older students to jump this particular step, but Neville\\'s memory was notoriously poor.\\n\\nHarry and Ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out, while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing wheezily.\\n\\n\"Shut it, you,\" said Ron, banging down its visor as they passed. They made their way up to the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, which was concealed behind a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink silk dress.\\n\\n\"Password?\" she said as they approached.\\n\\n\"Balderdash,\" said George, \"a prefect downstairs told me.\"\\n\\nThe portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall through which they all climbed. A crackling fire warmed the circular common room, which was full of squashy armchairs and tables. Hermione cast the merrily dancing flames a dark look, and Harry distinctly heard her mutter \"Slave labor\" before bidding them good night and disappearing through the doorway to the girls\\' dormitory.\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Neville climbed up the last, spiral staircase until they reached their own dormitory, which was situated at the top of the tower. Five four�poster beds with deep crimson hangings stood against the walls, each with its owner\\'s trunk at the foot. Dean and Seamus were already getting into bed; Seamus had pinned his Ireland rosette to his headboard, and Dean had tacked up a poster of Viktor Krum over his bedside table. His old poster of the West Ham football team was pinned right next to it.\\n\\n\"Mental,\" Ron sighed, shaking his head at the completely stationary soccer players.\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Neville got into their pajamas and into bed. Someone � a house� elf, no doubt � had placed warming pans between the sheets. It was extremely comfortable, lying there in bed and listening to the storm raging outside.\\n\\n\"I might go in for it, you know,\" Ron said sleepily through the darkness, \"if Fred and George find out how to. . . the tournament. . . you never know, do you?\"\\n\\n\"S\\'pose not. .. .\"\\n\\nHarry rolled over in bed, a series of dazzling new pictures forming in his mind\\'s eye. . . . He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen. .\\n\\n. he had become Hogwarts champion. . . he was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding and screaming. . . he had just won the Triwizard Tournament. Cho\\'s face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her face glowing with admiration....\\n\\nHarry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad that Ron couldn\\'t see what he could.\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN � MAD�EYE MOODY\\n\\nThe storm had blown itself out by the following morning, though the ceiling in the Great Hall was still gloomy; heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead as Harry, Ron, and Hermione examined their new course schedules at breakfast. A few seats along, Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were discussing magical methods of aging themselves and bluffing their way into the Triwizard Tournament.\\n\\n\"Today\\'s not bad.. . outside all morning,\" said Ron, who was running his finger down the Monday column of his schedule. \"Herbology with the Hufflepuffs and Care of Magical Creatures... damn it, we\\'re still with the Slytherins. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Double Divination this afternoon,\" Harry groaned, looking down. Divination was his least favorite subject, apart from Potions. Professor Trelawney kept predicting Harry\\'s death, which he found extremely annoying.\\n\\n\"You should have given it up like me, shouldn\\'t you?\" said Hermione briskly, buttering herself some toast. \"Then you\\'d be doing something sensible like Arithmancy.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re eating again, I notice,\" said Ron, watching Hermione adding liberal amounts of jam to her toast too.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights,\" said Hermione haughtily.\\n\\n\"Yeah. . . and you were hungry,\" said Ron, grinning.\\n\\nThere was a sudden rustling noise above them, and a hundred owls came soaring through the open windows carrying the morning mail. Instinctively, Harry looked up, but there was no sign of white among the mass of brown and gray. The owls circled the tables, looking for the people to whom their letters and packages were addressed. A large tawny owl soared down to Neville Longbottom and deposited a parcel into his lap � Neville almost always forgot to pack something. On the other side of the Hall Draco Malfoy\\'s eagle owl had landed on his shoulder, carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from home. Trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach, Harry returned to his porridge. Was it possible that something had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius hadn\\'t even got his letter!\\n\\nHis preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.\\n\\n\"Bubotubers,\" Professor Sprout told them briskly. \"They need squeezing. You will collect the pus �\"\\n\\n\"The what?\" said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.\\n\\n\"Pus, Finnigan, pus,\" said Professor Sprout, \"and it\\'s extremely valuable, so don\\'t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon�hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.\"\\n\\nSqueezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish�green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.\\n\\n\"This\\'ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,\" said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork. \"An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.\"\\n\\n\"Like poor Eloise Midgen,\" said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff, in a hushed voice.\\n\\n\"She tried to curse hers off.\"\\n\\n\"Silly girl,\" said Professor Sprout, shaking her head. \"But Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end.\"\\n\\nA booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds, signaling the end of the lesson, and the class separated; the Hufflepuffs climbing the stone steps for Transfiguration, and the Gryffindors heading in the other direction, down the sloping lawn toward Hagrid\\'s small wooden cabin, which stood on the edge of the Forbidden Forest.\\n\\nHagrid was standing outside his hut, one hand on the collar of his enormous black boarhound, Fang. There were several open wooden crates on the ground at his feet, and Fang was whimpering and straining at his collar, apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely. As they drew nearer, an odd rattling noise reached their ears, punctuated by what sounded like minor explosions.\\n\\n\"Mornin\\'!\" Hagrid said, grinning at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Be\\'er wait fer the Slytherins, they won\\' want ter miss this � Blast�Ended Skrewts!\"\\n\\n\"Come again?\" said Ron.\\n\\nHagrid pointed down into the crates.\\n\\n\"Eurgh!\" squealed Lavender Brown, jumping backward. \"Eurgh\" just about summed up the Blast�Ended Skrewts in Harry\\'s opinion. They looked like deformed, shell�less lobsters, horribly pale and slimy�looking, with legs sticking out in very odd places and no visible heads. There were about a hundred of them in each crate, each about six inches long, crawling over one another, bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes. They were giving off a very powerful smell of\\n\\nrotting fish. Every now and then, sparks would fly out of the end of a skrewt, and with a small phut, it would be propelled forward several inches.\\n\\n\"On\\'y jus\\' hatched,\" said Hagrid proudly, \"so yeh\\'ll be able ter raise \\'em yerselves!\\n\\nThought we\\'d make a bit of a project of it!\"\\n\\n\"And why would we want to raise them?\" said a cold voice.\\n\\nThe Slytherins had arrived. The speaker was Draco Malfoy. Crabbe and Goyle were chuckling appreciatively at his words.\\n\\nHagrid looked stumped at the question.\\n\\n\"I mean, what do they do?\" asked Malfoy. \"What is the point of them?\"\\n\\nHagrid opened his mouth, apparently thinking hard; there was a few seconds\\' pause, then he said roughly, \"Tha\\'s next lesson, Malfoy. Yer jus\\' feedin\\' \\'em today.\\n\\nNow, yeh\\'ll wan\\' ter try \\'em on a few diff\\'rent things � I\\'ve never had \\'em before, not sure what they\\'ll go fer � I got ant eggs an\\' frog livers an\\' a bit o\\' grass snake � just try \\'em out with a bit of each.\"\\n\\n\"First pus and now this,\" muttered Seamus.\\n\\nNothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have made Harry, Ron, and Hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the Blast�Ended Skrewts. Harry couldn\\'t suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely pointless, because the skrewts didn\\'t seem to have mouths.\\n\\n\"Ouch!\" yelled Dean Thomas after about ten minutes. \"It got me.\"\\n\\nHagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious.\\n\\n\"Its end exploded!\" said Dean angrily, showing Hagrid a burn on his hand.\\n\\n\"Ah, yeah, that can happen when they blast off,\" said Hagrid, nodding.\\n\\n\"Eurgh!\" said Lavender Brown again. \"Eurgh, Hagrid, what\\'s that pointy thing on it?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, some of \\'em have got stings,\" said Hagrid enthusiastically (Lavender quickly withdrew her hand from the box). \"I reckon they\\'re the males. . . . The females\\'ve got sorta sucker things on their bellies. . . . I think they might be ter suck blood.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I can certainly see why we\\'re trying to keep them alive,\" said Malfoy sarcastically. \"Who wouldn\\'t want pets that can burn, sting, and bite all at once?\"\\n\\n\"Just because they\\'re not very pretty, it doesn\\'t mean they\\'re not useful,\" Hermione snapped. \"Dragon blood\\'s amazingly magical, but you wouldn\\'t want a dragon for a pet, would you?\"\\n\\nHarry and Ron grinned at Hagrid, who gave them a furtive smile from behind his\\n\\nbushy beard. Hagrid would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew only too well � he had owned one for a brief period during their first year, a vicious Norwegian Ridgeback by the name of Norbert.\\n\\nHagrid simply loved monstrous creatures, the more lethal, the better.\\n\\n\"Well, at least the skrewts are small,\" said Ron as they made their way back up to the castle for lunch an hour later.\\n\\n\"They are now,\" said Hermione in an exasperated voice, \"but once Hagrid\\'s found out what they eat, I expect they\\'ll be six feet long.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that won\\'t matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something, will it?\"\\n\\nsaid Ron, grinning slyly at her.\\n\\n\"You know perfectly well I only said that to shut Malfoy up,\" said Hermione. \"As a matter of fact I think he\\'s right. The best thing to do would be to stamp on the lot of them before they start attacking us all.\"\\n\\nThey sat down at the Gryffindor table and helped themselves to lamb chops and potatoes. Hermione began to eat so fast that Harry and Ron stared at her.\\n\\n\"Er � is this the new stand on elf rights?\" said Ron. \"You\\'re going to make yourself puke instead?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Hermione, with as much dignity as she could muster with her mouth bulging with sprouts. \"I just want to get to the library.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Ron in disbelief. \"Hermione � it\\'s the first day back! We haven\\'t even got homework yet!\"\\n\\nHermione shrugged and continued to shovel down her food as though she had not eaten for days. Then she leapt to her feet, said, \"See you at dinner!\" and departed at high speed.\\n\\nWhen the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons, Harry and Ron set off for North Tower where, at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase, a silver stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling, and the room where Professor Trelawney lived.\\n\\nThe familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire met their nostrils as they emerged at the top of the stepladder. As ever, the curtains were all closed; the circular room was bathed in a dim reddish light cast by the many lamps, which were all draped with scarves and shawls. Harry and Ron walked through the mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room, and sat down at the same small circular table.\\n\\n\"Good day,\" said the misty voice of Professor Trelawney right behind Harry, making him jump.\\n\\nA very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes appear far too large\\n\\nfor her face, Professor Trelawney was peering down at Harry with the tragic expression she always wore whenever she saw him. The usual large amount of beads, chains, and bangles glittered upon her person in the firelight.\\n\\n\"You are preoccupied, my dear,\" she said mournfully to Harry. \"My inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within. And I regret to say that your worries are not baseless. I see difficult times ahead for you, alas. . . most difficult..\\n\\n. I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass. . . and perhaps sooner than you think...\"\\n\\nHer voice dropped almost to a whisper. Ron rolled his eyes at Harry, who looked stonily back. Professor Trelawney swept past them and seated herself in a large winged armchair before the fire, facing the class. Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil, who deeply admired Professor Trelawney, were sitting on poufs very close to her.\\n\\n\"My dears, it is time for us to consider the stars,\" she said. \"The movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance. Human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays, which intermingle. . .\"\\n\\nBut Harry\\'s thoughts had drifted. The perfumed fire always made him feel sleepy and dull�witted, and Professor Trelawney\\'s rambling talks on fortune�telling never held him exactly spellbound � though he couldn\\'t help thinking about what she had just said to him. \"I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass...\\'�\\n\\nBut Hermione was right, Harry thought irritably, Professor Trelawney really was an old fraud. He wasn\\'t dreading anything at the moment at all. . . well, unless you counted his fears that Sirius had been caught. . . but what did Professor Trelawney know? He had long since come to the conclusion that her brand of fortunetelling was really no more than lucky guesswork and a spooky manner.\\n\\nExcept, of course, for that time at the end of last term, when she had made the prediction about Voldemort rising again. . . and Dumbledore himself had said that he thought that trance had been genuine, when Harry had described it to him.\\n\\n\"Harry!\" Ron muttered.\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\nHarry looked around; the whole class was staring at him. He sat up straight; he had been almost dozing off, lost in the heat and his thoughts.\\n\\n\"I was saying, my dear, that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn,\" said Professor Trelawney, a faint note of resentment in her voice at the fact that he had obviously not been hanging on her words.\\n\\n\"Born under � what, sorry?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Saturn, dear, the planet Saturn!\" said Professor Trelawney, sounding definitely\\n\\nirritated that he wasn\\'t riveted by this news. \"I was saying that Saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your birth. . . . Your dark hair.\\n\\n. . your mean stature...tragic losses so young in life. . . I think I am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in midwinter?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry, \"I was born in July.\"\\n\\nRon hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough.\\n\\nHalf an hour later, each of them had been given a complicated circular chart, and was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at their moment of birth. It was dull work, requiring much consultation of timetables and calculation of angles.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got two Neptunes here,\" said Harry after a while, frowning down at his piece of parchment, \"that can\\'t be right, can it?\"\\n\\n\"Aaaaah,\" said Ron, imitating Professor Trelawney\\'s mystical whisper, \"when two Neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born, Harry. . . .\"\\n\\nSeamus and Dean, who were working nearby, sniggered loudly, though not loudly enough to mask the excited squeals from Lavender Brown � \"Oh Professor, look! I think I\\'ve got an unaspected planet! Oooh, which one\\'s that, Professor?\"\\n\\n\"It is Uranus, my dear,\" said Professor Trelawney, peering down at the chart.\\n\\n\"Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?\" said Ron.\\n\\nMost unfortunately, Professor Trelawney heard him, and it was this, perhaps, that made her give them so much homework at the end of the class.\\n\\n\"A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you, with reference to your personal chart,\" she snapped, sounding much more like Professor McGonagall than her usual airy�fairy self. \"I want it ready to hand in next Monday, and no excuses!\"\\n\\n\"Miserable old bat,\" said Ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the Great Hall and dinner. \"That\\'ll take all weekend, that will. .\\n\\n.\"\\n\\n\"Lots of homework?\" said Hermione brightly, catching up with them. \"Professor Vector didn\\'t give us any at all!\"\\n\\n\"Well, bully for Professor Vector,\" said Ron moodily.\\n\\nThey reached the entrance hall, which was packed with people queuing for dinner.\\n\\nThey had just joined the end of the line, when a loud voice rang out behind them.\\n\\n\"Weasley! Hey, Weasley!\"\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione turned. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing\\n\\nthere, each looking thoroughly pleased about something.\\n\\n\"What?\" said Ron shortly.\\n\\n\"Your dad\\'s in the paper, Weasley!\" said Malfoy, brandishing a copy of the Daily Prophet and speaking very loudly, so that everyone in the packed entrance hall could hear. \"Listen to this!\\n\\nFURTHER MISTAKES AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC It seems as though the Ministry of Magic\\'s troubles are not yet at an end, writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. Recently under fire for its poor crowd control at the Quidditch World Cup, and still unable to account for the disappearance of one of its witches, the Ministry was plunged into fresh embarrassment yesterday by the antics of Arnold Weasley, of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.\"\\n\\nMalfoy looked up.\\n\\n\"Imagine them not even getting his name right, Weasley. It\\'s almost as though he\\'s a complete nonentity, isn\\'t it?\" he crowed.\\n\\nEveryone in the entrance hall was listening now. Malfoy straightened the paper with a flourish and read on: Arnold Weasley, who was charged with possession of a flying car two years ago, was yesterday involved in a tussle with several Muggle law�keepers (\"policemen\") over a number of highly aggressive dustbins. Mr. Weasley appears to have rushed to the aid of \"Mad�Eye\" Moody, the aged ex�Auror who retired from the Ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted murder. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Weasley found, upon arrival at Mr. Moody\\'s heavily guarded house, that Mr. Moody had once again raised a false alarm. Mr. Weasley was forced to modify several memories before he could escape from the policemen, but refused to answer Daily Prophet questions about why he had involved the Ministry in such an undignified and potentially embarrassing scene.\\n\\n\"And there\\'s a picture, Weasley!\" said Malfoy, flipping the paper over and holding it up. \"A picture of your parents outside their house � if you can call it a house!\\n\\nYour mother could do with losing a bit of weight, couldn\\'t she?\"\\n\\nRon was shaking with fury. Everyone was staring at him.\\n\\n\"Get stuffed, Malfoy,\" said Harry. \"C\\'mon, Ron. . .\"\\n\\n\"Oh yeah, you were staying with them this summer, weren\\'t you, Potter?\" sneered Malfoy. \"So tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?\"\\n\\n\"You know your mother, Malfoy?\" said Harry � both he and Hermione had grabbed the back of Ron\\'s robes to stop him from launching himself at Malfoy �\\n\\n\"that expression she\\'s got, like she\\'s got dung under her nose? Has she always looked like that, or was it just because you were with her?\"\\n\\nMalfoy\\'s pale face went slightly pink.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you dare insult my mother, Potter.\"\\n\\n\"Keep your fat mouth shut, then,\" said Harry, turning away.\\n\\nBANG!\\n\\nSeveral people screamed � Harry felt something white�hot graze the side of his face � he plunged his hand into his robes for his wand, but before he\\'d even touched it, he heard a second loud BANG, and a roar that echoed through the entrance hall.\\n\\n\"OH NO YOU DON\\'T, LADDIE!\"\\n\\nHarry spun around. Professor Moody was limping down the marble staircase. His wand was out and it was pointing right at a pure white ferret, which was shivering on the stone�flagged floor, exactly where Malfoy had been standing.\\n\\nThere was a terrified silence in the entrance hall. Nobody but Moody was moving a muscle. Moody turned to look at Harry �� at least, his normal eye was looking at Harry; the other one was pointing into the back of his head.\\n\\n\"Did he get you?\" Moody growled. His voice was low and gravelly.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry, \"missed.\"\\n\\n\"LEAVE IT!\" Moody shouted.\\n\\n\"Leave � what?\" Harry said, bewildered.\\n\\n\"Not you � him!\" Moody growled, jerking his thumb over his shoulder at Crabbe, who had just frozen, about to pick up the white ferret. It seemed that Moody\\'s rolling eye was magical and could see out of the back of his head.\\n\\nMoody started to limp toward Crabbe, Goyle, and the ferret, which gave a terrified squeak and took off, streaking toward the dungeons.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think so!\" roared Moody, pointing his wand at the ferret again � it flew ten feet into the air, fell with a smack to the floor, and then bounced upward once more.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like people who attack when their opponent\\'s back\\'s turned,\" growled Moody as the ferret bounced higher and higher, squealing in pain. \"Stinking, cowardly, scummy thing to do...\"\\n\\nThe ferret flew through the air, its legs and tail flailing helplessly.\\n\\n\"Never � do � that � again �\" said Moody, speaking each word as the ferret hit the\\n\\nstone floor and bounced upward again.\\n\\n\"Professor Moody!\" said a shocked voice.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall was coming down the marble staircase with her arms full of books.\\n\\n\"Hello, Professor McGonagall,\" said Moody calmly, bouncing the ferret still higher.\\n\\n\"What � what are you doing?\" said Professor McGonagall, her eyes following the bouncing ferret\\'s progress through the air.\\n\\n\"Teaching,\" said Moody.\\n\\n\"Teach � Moody, is that a student?\" shrieked Professor McGonagall, the books spilling out of her arms.\\n\\n\"Yep,\" said Moody.\\n\\n\"No!\" cried Professor McGonagall, running down the stairs and pulling out her wand; a moment later, with a loud snapping noise, Draco Malfoy had reappeared, lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face. He got to his feet, wincing.\\n\\n\"Moody, we never use Transfiguration as a punishment!\" said Professor McGonagall wealdy. \"Surely Professor Dumbledore told you that?\"\\n\\n\"He might\\'ve mentioned it, yeah,\" said Moody, scratching his chin unconcernedly, \"but I thought a good sharp shock �\"\\n\\n\"We give detentions, Moody! Or speak to the offender\\'s Head of House!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do that, then,\" said Moody, staring at Malfoy with great dislike.\\n\\nMalfoy, whose pale eyes were still watering with pain and humiliation, looked malevolently up at Moody and muttered something in which the words \"my father\" were distinguishable.\\n\\n\"Oh yeah?\" said Moody quietly, limping forward a few steps, the dull clunk of his wooden leg echoing around the hall. \"Well, I know your father of old, boy... . You tell him Moody\\'s keeping a close eye on his son. . . you tell him that from me. . . .\\n\\nNow, your Head of House\\'ll be Snape, will it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Malfoy resentfully.\\n\\n\"Another old friend,\" growled Moody. \"I\\'ve been looking forward to a chat with old Snape. . . . Come on, you. . .\"\\n\\nAnd he seized Malfoy\\'s upper arm and marched him off toward the dungeons.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall stared anxiously after them for a few moments, then waved\\n\\nher wand at her fallen books, causing them to soar up into the air and back into her arms.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t talk to me,\" Ron said quietly to Harry and Hermione as they sat down at the Gryffindor table a few minutes later, surrounded by excited talk on all sides about what had just happened.\\n\\n\"Why not?\" said Hermione in surprise.\\n\\n\"Because I want to fix that in my memory forever,\" said Ron, his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face. \"Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret.\"\\n\\nHarry and Hermione both laughed, and Hermione began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates.\\n\\n\"He could have really hurt Malfoy, though,\" she said. \"It was good, really, that Professor McGonagall stopped it �\"\\n\\n\"Hermione!\" said Ron furiously, his eyes snapping open again, \"you\\'re ruining the best moment of my life!\"\\n\\nHermione made an impatient noise and began to eat at top speed again.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t tell me you\\'re going back to the library this evening?\" said Harry, watching her.\\n\\n\"Got to,\" said Hermione thickly. \"Loads to do.\"\\n\\n\"But you told us Professor Vector �\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not schoolwork,\" she said. Within five minutes, she had cleared her plate and departed. No sooner had she gone than her seat was taken by Fred Weasley.\\n\\n\"Moody!\" he said. \"How cool is he?\"\\n\\n\"Beyond cool,\" said George, sitting down opposite Fred. \"Supercool,\" said the twins\\' best friend, Lee Jordan, sliding into the seat beside George. \"We had him this afternoon,\" he told Harry and Ron.\\n\\n\"What was it like?\" said Harry eagerly.\\n\\nFred, George, and Lee exchanged looks full of meaning.\\n\\n\"Never had a lesson like it,\" said Fred.\\n\\n\"He knows, man,\" said Lee.\\n\\n\"Knows what?\" said Ron, leaning forward.\\n\\n\"Knows what it\\'s like to be out there doing it,\" said George impressively.\\n\\n\"Doing what?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Fighting the Dark Arts,\" said Fred.\\n\\n\"He\\'s seen it all,\" said George.\\n\\n\"Mazing,\" said Lee.\\n\\nRon dived into his bag for his schedule.\\n\\n\"We haven\\'t got him till Thursday!\" he said in a disappointed voice.\\n\\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN � THE UNFORGIVABLE CURSES\\n\\nThe next two days passed without great incident, unless you counted Neville melting his sixth cauldron in Potions. Professor Snape, who seemed to have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer, gave Nevihle detention, and Neville returned from it in a state of nervous collapse, having been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads.\\n\\n\"You know why Snape\\'s in such a foul mood, don\\'t you?\" said Ron to Harry as they watched Hermione teaching Neville a Scouring Charm to remove the frog guts from under his fingernails.\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"Moody.\"\\n\\nIt was common knowledge that Snape really wanted the Dark Arts job, and he had now failed to get it for the fourth year running. Snape had disliked all of their previous Dark Arts teachers, and shown it � but he seemed strangely wary of displaying overt animosity to Mad�Eye Moody. Indeed, whenever Harry saw the two of them together � at mealtimes, or when they passed in the corridors � he had the distinct impression that Snape was avoiding Moody\\'s eye, whether magical or normal.\\n\\n\"I reckon Snape\\'s a bit scared of him, you know,\" Harry said thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad,\" said Ron, his eyes misting over, \"and bounced him all around his dungeon...\"\\n\\nThe Gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to Moody\\'s first lesson so much that they arrived early on Thursday lunchtime and queued up outside his classroom before the bell had even rung. The only person missing was Hermione, who turned up just in time for the lesson.\\n\\n\"Been in the �\"\\n\\n\"Library.\" Harry finished her sentence for her. \"C\\'mon, quick, or we won\\'t get decent seats.\"\\n\\nThey hurried into three chairs right in front of the teacher\\'s desk, took out their copies of The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self�Protection, and waited, unusually quiet. Soon they heard Moody\\'s distinctive clunking footsteps coming down the corridor, and he entered the room, looking as strange and frightening as ever. They could just see his clawed, wooden foot protruding from underneath his robes.\\n\\n\"You can put those away,\" he growled, stumping over to his desk and sitting down, \"those books. You won\\'t need them.\"\\n\\nThey returned the books to their bags, Ron looking excited.\\n\\nMoody took out a register, shook his long mane of grizzled gray hair out of his twisted and scarred face, and began to call out names, his normal eye moving steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled around, fixing upon each student as he or she answered.\\n\\n\"Right then,\" he said, when the last person had declared themselves present, \"I\\'ve had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class. Seems you\\'ve had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling Dark creatures � you\\'ve covered boggarts, Red Caps, hinkypunks, grindylows, Kappas, and werewolves, is that right?\"\\n\\nThere was a general murmur of assent.\\n\\n\"But you\\'re behind � very behind � on dealing with curses,\" said Moody. \"So I\\'m here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other. I\\'ve got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark �\"\\n\\n\"What, aren\\'t you staying?\" Ron blurted out.\\n\\nMoody\\'s magical eye spun around to stare at Ron; Ron looked extremely apprehensive, but after a moment Moody smiled � the first time Harry had seen him do so. The effect was to make his heavily scarred face look more twisted and contorted than ever, but it was nevertheless good to know that he ever did anything as friendly as smile. Ron looked deeply relieved.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll be Arthur Weasley\\'s son, eh?\" Moody said. \"Your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago. .. . Yeah, I\\'m staying just the one year. Special favor to Dumbledore. . . . One year, and then back to my quiet retirement.\"\\n\\nHe gave a harsh laugh, and then clapped his gnarled hands together.\\n\\n\"So � straight into it. Curses. They come in many strengths and forms. Now, according to the Ministry of Magic, I\\'m supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that. I\\'m not supposed to show you what illegal Dark curses look like until you\\'re in the sixth year. You\\'re not supposed to be old enough to deal with it till then. But Professor Dumbledore\\'s got a higher opinion of your nerves, he reckons you can cope, and I say, the sooner you know what you\\'re up against, the better. How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you\\'ve never seen? A wizard who\\'s about to put an illegal curse on you isn\\'t going to tell you what he\\'s about to do. He\\'s not going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared. You need to be alert and watchful. You need to put that away, Miss Brown, when I\\'m talking.\"\\n\\nLavender jumped and blushed. She had been showing Parvati her completed horoscope under the desk. Apparently Moody\\'s magical eye could see through solid wood, as well as out of the back of his head.\\n\\n\"So. . . do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by wizarding law?\"\\n\\nSeveral hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron\\'s and Hermione\\'s. Moody pointed at Ron, though his magical eye was still fixed on Lavender.\\n\\n\"Er,\" said Ron tentatively, \"my dad told me about one.. . . Is it called the Imperius Curse, or something?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Moody appreciatively. \"Your father would know that one. Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse.\"\\n\\nMoody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and took out a glass jar. Three large black spiders were scuttling around inside it. Harry felt Ron recoil slightly next to him � Ron hated spiders.\\n\\nMoody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders, and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it. He then pointed his wand at it and muttered, \"Imperio!\"\\n\\nThe spider leapt from Moody\\'s hand on a fine thread of silk and began to swing backward and forward as though on a trapeze. It stretched out its legs rigidly, then did a back flip, breaking the thread and landing on the desk, where it began to cartwheel in circles. Moody jerked his wand, and the spider rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap dance.\\n\\nEveryone was laughing � everyone except Moody.\\n\\n\"Think it\\'s funny, do you?\" he growled. \"You\\'d like it, would you, if I did it to you?\"\\n\\nThe laughter died away almost instantly.\\n\\n\"Total control,\" said Moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began to roll over and over. \"I could make it jump out of the window, drown itself, throw itself down one of your throats. . .\"\\n\\nRon gave an involuntary shudder.\\n\\n\"Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius Curse,\" said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the days in which Voldemort had been all�powerful. \"Some job for the Ministry, trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their own free will.\\n\\n\"The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I\\'ll be teaching you how, but it takes real strength of character, and not everyone\\'s got it. Better avoid being hit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!\" he barked, and everyone jumped.\\n\\nMoody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar.\\n\\n\"Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?\"\\n\\nHermione\\'s hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry\\'s slight surprise, did Neville\\'s. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered information was\\n\\nHerbology which was easily his best subject. Neville looked surprised at his own daring.\\n\\n\"Yes?\" said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to fix on Neville.\\n\\n\"There\\'s one � the Cruciatus Curse,\" said Neville in a small but distinct voice.\\n\\nMoody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both eyes.\\n\\n\"Your name\\'s Longbottom?\" he said, his magical eye swooping down to check the register again.\\n\\nNeville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further inquiries. Turning back to the class at large, he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon the desktop, where it remained motionless, apparently too scared to move.\\n\\n\"The Cruciatus Curse,\" said Moody. \"Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea,\" he said, pointing his wand at the spider. \"Engorgio!\"\\n\\nThe spider swelled. It was now larger than a tarantula. Abandoning all pretense, Ron pushed his chair backward, as far away from Moody\\'s desk as possible.\\n\\nMoody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered, \"Crucio!\"\\n\\nAt once, the spider\\'s legs bent in upon its body; it rolled over and began to twitch horribly, rocking from side to side. No sound came from it, but Harry was sure that if it could have given voice, it would have been screaming. Moody did not remove his wand, and the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently � \"Stop it!\" Hermione said shrilly.\"\\n\\nHarry looked around at her. She was looking, not at the spider, but at Neville, and Harry, following her gaze, saw that Neville\\'s hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes wide and horrified.\\n\\nMoody raised his wand. The spider\\'s legs relaxed, but it continued to twitch.\\n\\n\"Reducio,\" Moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its proper size. He put it back into the jar.\\n\\n\"Pain,\" said Moody softly. \"You don\\'t need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse. . . . That one was very popular once too.\\n\\n\"Right. . . anyone know any others?\"\\n\\nHarry looked around. From the looks on everyone\\'s faces, he guessed they were all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider. Hermione\\'s hand shook slightly as, for the third time, she raised it into the air.\\n\\n\"Yes?\" said Moody, looking at her.\\n\\n\"Avada Kedavra,\" Hermione whispered.\\n\\nSeveral people looked uneasily around at her, including Ron.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" said Moody, another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth. \"Yes, the last and worst. Avada Kedavra. .. the Killing Curse.\"\\n\\nHe put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as though it knew what was coming, the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar, trying to evade Moody\\'s fingers, but he trapped it, and placed it upon the desktop. It started to scuttle frantically across the wooden surface.\\n\\nMoody raised his wand, and Harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding.\\n\\n\"Avada Kedavra!\" Moody roared.\\n\\nThere was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as though a vast, invisible something was soaring through the air � instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but unmistakably dead. Several of the students stifled cries; Ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him.\\n\\nMoody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.\\n\\n\"Not nice,\" he said calmly. \"Not pleasant. And there\\'s no countercurse. There\\'s no blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he\\'s sitting right in front of me.\"\\n\\nHarry felt his face redden as Moody\\'s eyes (both of them) looked into his own. He could feel everyone else looking around at him too. Harry stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at all....\\n\\nSo that was how his parents had died. . . exactly like that spider. Had they been unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of green light and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their bodies!\\n\\nHarry had been picturing his parents\\' deaths over and over again for three years now, ever since he\\'d found out they had been murdered, ever since he\\'d found out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents\\' whereabouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How Voldemort had killed Harry\\'s father first. How James Potter had tried to hold him off, while he shouted at his wife to take Harry and run. . . Voldemort had advanced on Lily Potter, told her to move aside so that he could kill Harry.. . how she had begged him to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son.. . and so Voldemort had murdered her too, before turning his wand on Harry.\\n\\nHarry knew these details because he had heard his parents\\' voices when he had fought the dementors last year � for that was the terrible power of the dementors: to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives, and drown, powerless, in their own despair.\\n\\nMoody was speaking again, from a great distance, it seemed to Harry. With a massive effort, he pulled himself back to the present and listened to what Moody was saying.\\n\\n\"Avada Kedavra\\'s a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it � you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I\\'d get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn\\'t matter. I\\'m not here to teach you how to do it.\\n\\n\"Now, if there\\'s no countercurse, why am I showing you? Because you\\'ve got to know. You\\'ve got to appreciate what the worst is. You don\\'t want to find yourself in a situation where you\\'re facing it. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!\" he roared, and the whole class jumped again.\\n\\n\"Now. . . those three curses � Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus � are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That\\'s what you\\'re up against. That\\'s what I\\'ve got to teach you to fight. You need preparing. You need arming. But most of all, you need to practice constant, never�ceasing vigilance. Get out your quills. . . copy this down. . . .\"\\n\\nThey spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the Unforgivable Curses.\\n\\nNo one spoke until the bell rang � but when Moody had dismissed them and they had left the classroom, a torrent of talk burst forth. Most people were discussing the curses in awed voices � \"Did you see it twitch?\" \"� and when he killed it � just like that!\"\\n\\nThey were talking about the lesson, Harry thought, as though it had been some sort of spectacular show, but he hadn\\'t found it very entertaining � and nor, it seemed, had Hermione.\\n\\n\"Hurry up,\" she said tensely to Harry and Ron.\\n\\n\"Not the ruddy library again?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Hermione curtly, pointing up a side passage. \"Neville.\" Neville was standing alone, halfway up the passage, staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified, wide�eyed look he had worn when Moody had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse.\\n\\n\"Neville?\" Hermione said gently.\\n\\nNeville looked around.\\n\\n\"Oh hello,\" he said, his voice much higher than usual. \"Interesting lesson, wasn\\'t it? I wonder what\\'s for dinner, I\\'m � I\\'m starving, aren\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Neville, are you all right?\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"Oh yes, I\\'m fine,\" Neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice. \"Very\\n\\ninteresting dinner � I mean lesson � what\\'s for eating?\"\\n\\nRon gave Harry a startled look.\\n\\n\"Neville, what � ?\"\\n\\nBut an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see Professor Moody limping toward them. All four of them fell silent, watching him apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right, sonny,\" he said to Neville. \"Why don\\'t you come up to my office!\\n\\nCome on. . . we can have a cup of tea. . . .\"\\n\\nNeville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody. He neither moved nor spoke. Moody turned his magical eye upon Harry.\\n\\n\"You all right, are you, Potter?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry, almost defiantly.\\n\\nMoody\\'s blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed Harry. Then he said, \"You\\'ve got to know. It seems harsh, maybe, but you\\'ve got to know. No point pretending. . . well.. . come on, Longbottom, I\\'ve got some books that might interest you.\"\\n\\nNeville looked pleadingly at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but they didn\\'t say anything, so Neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away, one of Moody\\'s gnarled hands on his shoulder.\\n\\n\"What was that about?\" said Ron, watching Neville and Moody turn the corner.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Hermione, looking pensive.\\n\\n\"Some lesson, though, eh?\" said Ron to Harry as they set off for the Great Hall.\\n\\n\"Fred and George were right, weren\\'t they? He really knows his stuff, Moody, doesn\\'t he? When he did Avada Kedavra, the way that spider just died, just snuffed it right �\"\\n\\nBut Ron fell suddenly silent at the look on Harry\\'s face and didn\\'t speak again until they reached the Great Hall, when he said he supposed they had better make a start on Professor Trelawney\\'s predictions tonight, since they would take hours.\\n\\nHermione did not join in with Harry and Ron\\'s conversation during dinner, but ate furiously fast, and then left for the library again. Harry and Ron walked back to Gryffindor Tower, and Harry, who had been thinking of nothing else all through dinner, now raised the subject of the Unforgivable Curses himself.\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with the Ministry if they knew we\\'d seen the curses?\" Harry asked as they approached the Fat Lady.\\n\\n\"Yeah, probably,\" said Ron. \"But Dumbledore\\'s always done things his way, hasn\\'t he, and Moody\\'s been getting in trouble for years, I reckon. Attacks first and asks questions later � look at his dustbins. Balderdash.\"\\n\\nThe Fat Lady swung forward to reveal the entrance hole, and they climbed into the Gryffindor common room, which was crowded and noisy.\\n\\n\"Shall we get our Divination stuff, then?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"I s\\'pose,\" Ron groaned.\\n\\nThey went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts, to find Neville there alone, sitting on his bed, reading. He looked a good deal calmer than at the end of Moody\\'s lesson, though still not entirely normal. His eyes were rather red.\\n\\n\"You all right, Neville?\" Harry asked him.\\n\\n\"Oh yes,\" said Neville, \"I\\'m fine, thanks. Just reading this book Professor Moody lent me. . .\"\\n\\nHe held up the book: Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean.\\n\\n\"Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I\\'m really good at Herbology,\" Neville said. There was a faint note of pride in his voice that Harry had rarely heard there before. \"He thought I\\'d like this.\"\\n\\nTelling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry thought, had been a very tactful way of cheering Neville up, for Neville very rarely heard that he was good at anything. It was the sort of thing Professor Lupin would have done.\\n\\nHarry and Ron took their copies of Unfogging the Future back down to the common room, found a table, and set to work on their predictions for the coming month. An hour later, they had made very little progress, though their table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols, and Harry\\'s brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney\\'s fire.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t got a clue what this lot\\'s supposed to mean,\" he said, staring down at a long list of calculations.\\n\\n\"You know,\" said Ron, whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run his fingers through it in frustration, \"I think it\\'s back to the old Divination standby.\"\\n\\n\"What � make it up?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron, sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table, dipping his pen into some ink, and starting to write.\\n\\n\"Next Monday,\" he said as he scribbled, \"I am likely to develop a cough, owing to the unlucky conjunction of Mars and Jupiter.\" He looked up at Harry. \"You know\\n\\nher � just put in loads of misery, she\\'ll lap it up.\"\\n\\n\"Right,\" said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire. \"Okay. . . on Monday, I will be in danger of� er � burns.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, you will be,\" said Ron darkly, \"we\\'re seeing the skrewts again on Monday.\\n\\nOkay, Tuesday, I\\'ll. . . erm. .\\n\\n\"Lose a treasured possession,\" said Harry, who was flicking through Unfogging the Future for ideas.\\n\\n\"Good one,\" said Ron, copying it down. \"Because of... erm. . . Mercury. Why don\\'t you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah. . . cool. . .\" said Harry, scribbling it down, \"because... Venus is in the twelfth house.\"\\n\\n\"And on Wednesday, I think I\\'ll come off worst in a fight.\"\\n\\n\"Aaah, I was going to have a fight. Okay, I\\'ll lose a bet.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, you\\'ll be betting I\\'ll win my fight. ..\\n\\nThey continued to make up predictions (which grew steadily more tragic) for another hour, while the common room around them slowly emptied as people went up to bed. Crookshanks wandered over to them, leapt lightly into an empty chair, and stared inscrutably at Harry, rather as Hermione might look if she knew they weren\\'t doing their homework properly.\\n\\nStaring around the room, trying to think of a kind of misfortune he hadn\\'t yet used, Harry saw Fred and George sitting together against the opposite wall, heads together, quills out, poring over a single piece of parchment. It was most unusual to see Fred and George hidden away in a corner and working silently; they usually liked to be in the thick of things and the noisy center of attention. There was something secretive about the way they were working on the piece of parchment, and Harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing something back at the Burrow. He had thought then that it was another order form for Weasleys\\' Wizard Wheezes, but it didn\\'t look like that this time; if it had been, they would surely have let Lee Jordan in on the joke. He wondered whether it had anything to do with entering the Triwizard Tournament.\\n\\nAs Harry watched, George shook his head at Fred, scratched out something with his quill, and said, in a very quiet voice that nevertheless carried across the almost deserted room, \"No � that sounds like we\\'re accusing him. Got to be careful. . .\"\\n\\nThen George looked over and saw Harry watching him. Harry grinned and quickly returned to his predictions � he didn\\'t want George to think he was eavesdropping.\\n\\nShortly after that, the twins rolled up their parchment, said good night, and went off to bed.\\n\\nFred and George had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened and Hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other.\\n\\nCrookshanks arched his back, purring.\\n\\n\"Hello,\" she said, \"I\\'ve just finished!\"\\n\\n\"So have I!\" said Ron triumphantly, throwing down his quill.\\n\\nHermione sat down, laid the things she was carrying in an empty armchair, and pulled Ron\\'s predictions toward her.\\n\\n\"Not going to have a very good month, are you?\" she said sardonically as Crookshanks curled up in her lap.\\n\\n\"Ah well, at least I\\'m forewarned,\" Ron yawned.\\n\\n\"You seem to be drowning twice,\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"Oh am I?\" said Ron, peering down at his predictions. \"I\\'d better change one of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you think it\\'s a bit obvious you\\'ve made these up?\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"How dare you!\" said Ron, in mock outrage. \"We\\'ve been working like house� elves here!\"\\n\\nHermione raised her eyebrows.\\n\\n\"It\\'s just an expression,\" said Ron hastily.\\n\\nHarry laid down his quill too, having just finished predicting his own death by decapitation.\\n\\n\"What\\'s in the box?\" he asked, pointing at it.\\n\\n\"Funny you should ask,\" said Hermione, with a nasty look at Ron. She took off the lid and showed them the contents.\\n\\nInside were about fifty badges, all of different colors, but all bearing the same letters: S. P. E .W.\\n\\n\"Spew?\" said Harry, picking up a badge and looking at it. \"What\\'s this about?\"\\n\\n\"Not spew,\" said Hermione impatiently. \"It\\'s S�P�E�W. Stands for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare.\"\\n\\n\"Never heard of it,\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Well, of course you haven\\'t,\" said Hermione briskly, \"I\\'ve only just started it.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah?\" said Ron in mild surprise. \"How many members have you got?\"\\n\\n\"Well � if you two join � three,\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"And you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying \\'spew,\\' do you?\"\\n\\nsaid Ron.\\n\\n\"S�P�E�W!\" said Hermione hotly. \"I was going to put Stop the Outrageous Abuse of Our Fellow Magical Creatures and Campaign for a Change in Their Legal Status � but it wouldn\\'t fit. So that\\'s the heading of our manifesto.\"\\n\\nShe brandished the sheaf of parchment at them.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf enslavement goes back centuries. I can\\'t believe no one\\'s done anything about it before now.\"\\n\\n\"Hermione � open your ears,\" said Ron loudly. \"They. Like. It. They like being enslaved!\"\\n\\n\"Our short�term aims,\" said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn\\'t heard a word, \"are to secure house�elves fair wages and working conditions. Our long�term aims include changing the law about non� wand use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because they\\'re shockingly underrepresented.\"\\n\\n\"And how do we do all this?\" Harry asked.\\n\\n\"We start by recruiting members,\" said Hermione happily. \"I thought two Sickles to join � that buys a badge � and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign.\\n\\nYou\\'re treasurer, Ron � I\\'ve got you a collecting tin upstairs � and Harry, you\\'re secretary, so you might want to write down everything I\\'m saying now, as a record of our first meeting.\"\\n\\nThere was a pause in which Hermione beamed at the pair of them, and Harry sat, torn between exasperation at Hermione and amusement at the look on Ron\\'s face.\\n\\nThe silence was broken, not by Ron, who in any case looked as though he was temporarily dumbstruck, but by a soft tap, tap on the window. Harry looked across the now empty common room and saw, illuminated by the moonlight, a snowy owl perched on the windowsill.\\n\\n\"Hedwig!\" he shouted, and he launched himself out of his chair and across the room to pull open the window.\\n\\nHedwig flew inside, soared across the room, and landed on the table on top of Harry\\'s predictions.\\n\\n\"About time!\" said Harry, hurrying after her.\\n\\n\"She\\'s got an answer!\" said Ron excitedly, pointing at the grubby piece of parchment tied to Hedwig\\'s leg.\\n\\nHarry hastily untied it and sat down to read, whereupon Hedwig fluttered onto his\\n\\nknee, hooting softly.\\n\\n\"What does it say?\" Hermione asked breathlessly.\\n\\nThe letter was very short, and looked as though it had been scrawled in a great hurry. Harry read it aloud: Harry � I\\'m flying north immediately. This news about your scar is the latest in a series of strange rumors that have reached me here. If it hurts again, go straight to Dumbledore � they\\'re saying he\\'s got Mad�Eye out of retirement, which means he\\'s reading the signs, even if no one else is.\\n\\nI\\'ll be in touch soon. My best to Ron and Hermione. Keep your eyes open, Harry.\\n\\nSirius Harry looked up at Ron and Hermione, who stared back at him.\\n\\n\"He\\'s flying north?\" Hermione whispered. \"He\\'s coming back?\"\\n\\n\"Dumbledore\\'s reading what signs?\" said Ron, looking perplexed. \"Harry � what\\'s up?\"\\n\\nFor Harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist, jolting Hedwig out of his lap.\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t\\'ve told him!\" Harry said furiously.\\n\\n\"What are you on about?\" said Ron in surprise.\\n\\n\"It\\'s made him think he\\'s got to come back!\" said Harry, now slamming his fist on the table so that Hedwig landed on the back of Ron\\'s chair, hooting indignantly.\\n\\n\"Coming back, because he thinks I\\'m in trouble! And there\\'s nothing wrong with me! And I haven\\'t got anything for you,\" Harry snapped at Hedwig, who was clicking her beak expectantly, \"you\\'ll have to go up to the Owlery if you want food.\"\\n\\nHedwig gave him an extremely offended look and took off for the open window, cuffing him around the head with her outstretched wing as she went.\\n\\n\"Harry,\" Hermione began, in a pacifying sort of voice.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to bed,\" said Harry shortly. \"See you in the morning.\"\\n\\nUpstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pajamas and got into his four�poster, but he didn\\'t feel remotely tired.\\n\\nIf Sirius came back and got caught, it would be his, Harry\\'s, fault. Why hadn\\'t he kept his mouth shut? A few seconds\\' pain and he\\'d had to blab. . . . If he\\'d just had the sense to keep it to himself.\\n\\nHe heard Ron come up into the dormitory a short while later, but did not speak to him. For a long time, Harry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his bed. The dormitory was completely silent, and, had he been less preoccupied, Harry would have realized that the absence of Neville\\'s usual snores meant that he was not the only one lying awake.\\n\\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN � BEAUXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG\\n\\nEarly next morning, Harry woke with a plan fully formed in his mind, as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all night. He got up, dressed in the pale dawn light, left the dormitory without waking Ron, and went back down to the deserted common room. Here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon which his Divination homework still lay and wrote the following letter: Dear Sirius, I reckon I just imagined my scar hurting, I was half asleep when I wrote to you last time. There\\'s no point coming back, everything\\'s fine here. Don\\'t worry about me, my head feels completely normal.\\n\\nHarry He then climbed out of the portrait hole, up through the silent castle (held up only briefly by Peeves, who tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along the fourth�floor corridor), finally arriving at the Owlery, which was situated at the top of West Tower.\\n\\nThe Owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold and drafty, because none of the windows had glass in them. The floor was entirely covered in straw, owl droppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles. Hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right up to the top of the tower, nearly all of them asleep, though here and there a round amber eye glared at Harry. He spotted Hedwig nestled between a barn owl and a tawny, and hurried over to her, sliding a little on the dropping�strewn floor.\\n\\nIt took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him, as she kept shuffling around on her perch, showing him her tail. She was evidently still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night. In the end, it was Harry suggesting she might be too tired, and that perhaps he would ask Ron to borrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it.\\n\\n\"Just find him, all right?\" Harry said, stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall. \"Before the dementors do.\"\\n\\nShe nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have done, but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same. Then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise. Harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach. He had been so sure that Sirius\\'s reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them.\\n\\n\"That was a lie, Harry,\" said Hermione sharply over breakfast, when he told her and Ron what he had done. \"You didn\\'t imagine your scar hurting and you know\\n\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"So what?\" said Harry. \"He\\'s not going back to Azkaban because of me.\"\\n\\n\"Drop it,\" said Ron sharply to Hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once, Hermione heeded him, and fell silent.\\n\\nHarry did his best not to worry about Sirius over the next couple of weeks. True, he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went to sleep, prevent himself from seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark London street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his godfather. He wished he still had Quidditch to distract him; nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training session. On the other hand, their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever before, particularly Moody\\'s Defense Against the Dark Arts.\\n\\nTo their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he would be putting the Imperius Curse on each of them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its effects.\\n\\n\"But � but you said it\\'s illegal, Professor,\" said Hermione uncertainly as Moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room. \"You said � to use it against another human was �\"\\n\\n\"Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like,\" said Moody, his magical eye swiveling onto Hermione and fixing her with an eerie, unblinking stare. \"If you\\'d rather learn the hard way � when someone\\'s putting it on you so they can control you completely � fine by me. You\\'re excused. Off you go.\"\\n\\nHe pointed one gnarled finger toward the door. Hermione went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave. Harry and Ron grinned at each other. They knew Hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson.\\n\\nMoody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the Imperius Curse upon them. Harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence. Dean Thomas hopped three times around the room, singing the national anthem. Lavender Brown imitated a squirrel. Neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of them recovered only when Moody had removed it.\\n\\n\"Potter,\" Moody growled, \"you next.\"\\n\\nHarry moved forward into the middle of the classroom, into the space that Moody had cleared of desks. Moody raised his wand, pointed it at Harry, and said, \\'1mperio!\"\\n\\nIt was the most wonderful feeling. Harry felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness. He stood there feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of everyone watching him.\\n\\nAnd then he heard Mad�Eye Moody\\'s voice, echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain: Jump onto the desk. . . jump onto the desk. . .\\n\\nHarry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring.\\n\\nJump onto the desk....\\n\\nWhy, though? Another voice had awoken in the back of his brain.\\n\\nStupid thing to do, really, said the voice.\\n\\nJump onto the desk....\\n\\nNo, I don\\'t think I will, thanks, said the other voice, a little more firmly. . . no, I don\\'t really want to.\\n\\nJump! NOW!\\n\\nThe next thing Harry felt was considerable pain. He had both jumped and tried to prevent himself from jumping � the result was that he\\'d smashed headlong into the desk knocking it over, and, by the feeling in his legs, fractured both his kneecaps.\\n\\n\"Now, that\\'s more like it!\" growled Moody\\'s voice, and suddenly, Harry felt the empty, echoing feeling in his head disappear. He remembered exactly what was happening, and the pain in his knees seemed to double.\\n\\n\"Look at that, you lot. . . Potter fought! He fought it, and he damn near beat it!\\n\\nWe\\'ll try that again, Potter, and the rest of you, pay attention � watch his eyes, that\\'s where you see it � very good, Potter, very good indeed! They\\'ll have trouble controlling you!\"\\n\\n\"The way he talks,\" Harry muttered as he hobbled out of the Defense Against the Dark Arts class an hour later (Moody had insisted on putting Harry through his paces four times in a row, until Harry could throw off the curse entirely), \"you\\'d think we were all going to be attacked any second.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I know,\" said Ron, who was skipping on every alternate step. He had had much more difficulty with the curse than Harry, though Moody assured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime. \"Talk about paranoid. . .\" Ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that Moody was definitely out of earshot and went on. \"No wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the Ministry. Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted \\'Boo\\' behind him on April Fools\\' Day? And when are we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else we\\'ve got to do?\"\\n\\nAll the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they were required to do this term. Professor McGonagall explained why, when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration homework she had assigned.\\n\\n\"You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education!\" she told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles. \"Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer ��\"\\n\\n\"We don\\'t take O.W.L.s till fifth year!\" s aid Dean Thomas indignantly.\\n\\n\"Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the preparation you can get!\\n\\nMiss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion. I might remind you that your pincushion, Thomas, still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin!\"\\n\\nHermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed to be trying not to look too pleased with herself.\\n\\nHarry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney told them that they had received top marks for their homework in their next Divination class. She read out large portions of their predictions, commending them for their unflinching acceptance of the horrors in store for them � but they were less amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next; both of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes.\\n\\nMeanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught History of Magic, had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century. Professor Snape was forcing them to research antidotes. They took this one seriously, as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before Christmas to see if their antidote worked. Professor Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms.\\n\\nEven Hagrid was adding to their workload. The Blast�Ended Skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had yet discovered what they ate.\\n\\nHagrid was delighted, and as part of their \"project,\" suggested that they come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make notes on their extraordinary behavior.\\n\\n\"I will not,\" said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had proposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra�large toy out of his sack. \"I see enough of these foul things during lessons, thanks.\"\\n\\nHagrid\\'s smile faded off his face.\\n\\n\"Yeh\\'ll do wha\\' yer told,\" he growled, \"or I\\'ll be takin\\' a leaf outta Professor Moody\\'s book. . . . I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy.\"\\n\\nThe Gryffindors roared with laughter. Malfoy flushed with anger, but apparently\\n\\nthe memory of Moody\\'s punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting. Harry, Ron, and Hermione returned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits; seeing Hagrid put down Malfoy was particularly satisfying, especially because Malfoy had done his very best to get Hagrid sacked the previous year.\\n\\nWhen they arrived in the entrance hall, they found themselves unable to proceed owing to the large crowd of students congregated there, all milling around a large sign that had been erected at the foot of the marble staircase. Ron, the tallest of the three, stood on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of them and read the sign aloud to the other two:  TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT THE DELEGATIONS FROM BEAUXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG WILL BE ARRIVING AT 6 O\\'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE 30TH OF OCTOBER. LESSONS WILL END HALF AN HOUR EARLY �� \"Brilliant!\" said Harry. \"It\\'s Potions last thing on Friday! Snape won\\'t have time to poison us all!\"\\n\\nSTUDENTS WILL RETURN THEIR BAGS AND BOOKS TO THEIR DORMITORIES AND ASSEMBLE IN FRONT OF THE CASTLE TO GREET OUR GUESTS BEFORE THE WELCOMING FEAST.\\n\\n\"Only a week away!\" said Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff, emerging from the crowd, his eyes gleaming. \"I wonder if Cedric knows? Think I\\'ll go and tell him. . .\\n\\n.\"\\n\\n\"Cedric?\" said Ron blankly as Ernie hurried off.\\n\\n\"Diggory,\" said Harry. \"He must be entering the tournament.\"\\n\\n\"That idiot, Hogwarts champion?\" said Ron as they pushed their way through the chattering crowd toward the staircase.\\n\\n\"He\\'s not an idiot. You just don\\'t like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch,\" said Hermione. \"I\\'ve heard he\\'s a really good student � and he\\'s a prefect.\"\\n\\nShe spoke as though this settled the matter.\\n\\n\"You only like him because he\\'s handsome,\" said Ron scathingly.\\n\\n\"Excuse me, I don\\'t like people just because they\\'re handsome!\" said Hermione indignantly.\\n\\nRon gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like \"Lockhart!\"\\n\\nThe appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon the inhabitants of the castle. During the following week, there seemed to be only one topic of conversation, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard Tournament.\\n\\nRumors were flying from student to student like highly contagious germs: who was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what the tournament would involve, how the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang differed from themselves.\\n\\nHarry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an extra�thorough cleaning. Several grimy portraits had been scrubbed, much to the displeasure of their subjects, who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly and wincing as they felt their raw pink faces. The suits of armor were suddenly gleaming and moving without squeaking, and Argus Filch, the caretaker, was behaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he terrified a pair of first�year girls into hysterics.\\n\\nOther members of the staff seemed oddly tense too.\\n\\n\"Longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can\\'t even perform a simple Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang!\" Professor McGonagall barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson, during which Neville had accidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactus.\\n\\nWhen they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of October, they found that the Great Hall had been decorated overnight. Enormous silk banners hung from the walls, each of them representing a Hogwarts House: red with a gold lion for Gryffiindor, blue with a bronze eagle for Ravenclaw, yellow with a black badger for Hufflepuff, and green with a silver serpent for Slytherin. Behind the teachers\\' table, the largest banner of all bore the Hogwarts coat of arms: lion, eagle, badger, and snake united around a large letter H.\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione sat down beside Fred and George at the Gryffindor table. Once again, and most unusually, they were sitting apart from everyone else and conversing in low voices. Ron led the way over to them.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a bummer, all right,\" George was saying gloomily to Fred. \"But if he won\\'t talk to us in person, we\\'ll have to send him the letter after all. Or we\\'ll stuff it into his hand. He can\\'t avoid us forrever.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s avoiding you?\" said Ron, sitting down next to them.\\n\\n\"Wish you would,\" said Fred, looking irritated at the interruption.\\n\\n\"What\\'s a bummer?\" Ron asked George.\\n\\n\"Having a nosy git like you for a brother,\" said George.\\n\\n\"You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament yet?\" Harry asked. \"Thought any more about trying to enter?\"\\n\\n\"I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she wasn\\'t telling,\" said George bitterly. \"She just told me to shut up and get on with transfiguring my raccoon.\"\\n\\n\"Wonder what the tasks are going to be?\" said Ron thoughtfully. \"You know, I bet we could do them, Harry. We\\'ve done dangerous stuff before. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Not in front of a panel of judges, you haven\\'t,\" said Fred. \"McGonagall says the champions get awarded points according to how well they\\'ve done the tasks.\"\\n\\n\"Who are the judges?\" Harry asked.\\n\\n\"Well, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel,\" said Hermione, and everyone looked around at her, rather surprised, \"because all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage.\"\\n\\nShe noticed them all looking at her and said, with her usual air of impatience that nobody else had read all the books she had, \"It\\'s all in Hogwarts, A History.\\n\\nThough, of course, that book\\'s not entirely reliable. A Revised History of Hogwarts would be a more accurate title. Or A Highly Biased and Selective History of Hogwarts, Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School.\"\\n\\n\"What are you on about?\" said Ron, though Harry thought he knew what was coming.\\n\\n\"House�elves!\" said Hermione, her eyes flashing. \"Not once, in over a thousand pages, does Hogwarts, A History mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves!\"\\n\\nHarry shook his head and applied himself to his scrambled eggs. His and Ron\\'s lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb Hermione\\'s determination to pursue justice for house�elves.\\n\\nTrue, both of them had paid two Sickles for a S.P.E.W. badge, but they had only done it to keep her quiet. Their Sickles had been wasted, however; if anything, they seemed to have made Hermione more vociferous. She had been badgering Harry and Ron ever since, first to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do the same, and she had also taken to rattling around the Gryffindor common room every evening, cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses.\\n\\n\"You do realize that your sheets are changed, your fires lit, your classrooms cleaned, and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid and enslaved?\" she kept saying fiercely.\\n\\nSome people, like Neville, had paid up just to stop Hermione from glowering at them. A few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say, but were reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning. Many regarded the whole thing as a joke.\\n\\nRon now rolled his eyes at the ceiling, which was flooding them all in autumn sunlight, and Fred became extremely interested in his bacon (both twins had refused to buy a S.P.E.W. badge). George, however, leaned in toward Hermione.\\n\\n\"Listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens, Hermione?\"\\n\\n\"No, of course not,\" said Hermione curtly, \"I hardly think students are supposed to �\"\\n\\n\"Well, we have,\" said George, indicating Fred, \"loads of times, to nick food. And we\\'ve met them, and they\\'re happy. They think they\\'ve got the best job in the world �\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s because they\\'re uneducated and brainwashed!\" Hermione began hotly, but her next few words were drowned out by the sudden whooshing noise from overhead, which announced the arrival of the post owls. Harry looked up at once, and saw Hedwig soaring toward him. Hermione stopped talking abruptly; she and Ron watched Hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto Harry\\'s shoulder, folded her wings, and held out her leg wearily.\\n\\nHarry pulled off Sirius\\'s reply and offered Hedwig his bacon rinds, which she ate gratefully. Then, checking that Fred and George were safely immersed in further discussions about the Triwizard Tournament, Harry read out Sirius\\'s letter in a whisper to Ron and Hermione.\\n\\nNice try, Harry.\\n\\nI\\'m back in the country and well hidden. I want you to keep me posted on everything that\\'s going on at Hogwarts. Don\\'t use Hedwig, keep changing owls, and don\\'t worry about me, just watch out for yourself Don\\'t forget what I said about your scar.\\n\\nSirius \"Why d\\'you have to keep changing owls?\" Ron asked in a low voice.\\n\\n\"Hedwig\\'ll attract too much attention,\" said Hermione at once. \"She stands out. A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he\\'s hiding. . . I mean, they\\'re not native birds, are they?\"\\n\\nHarry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes, wondering whether he felt more or less worried than before. He supposed that Sirius managing to get back without being caught was something. He couldn\\'t deny either that the idea that Sirius was much nearer was reassuring; at least he wouldn\\'t have to wait so long for a response every time he wrote.\\n\\n\"Thanks, Hedwig,\" he said, stroking her. She hooted sleepily, dipped her beak briefly into his goblet of orange juice, then took off again, clearly desperate for a good long sleep in the Owlery.\\n\\nThere was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day. Nobody was very attentive in lessons, being much more interested in the arrival that evening of the people from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang; even Potions was more bearable than usual, as it was half an hour shorter. When the bell rang early, Harry, Ron, and Hermione hurried up to Gryffindor Tower, deposited their bags and books as they had been instructed, pulled on their cloaks, and rushed back downstairs into the entrance hall.\\n\\nThe Heads of Houses were ordering their students into lines.\\n\\n\"Weasley, straighten your hat,\" Professor McGonagall snapped at Ron. \"Miss Patil, take that ridiculous thing out of your hair.\"\\n\\nParvati scowled and removed a large ornamental butterfly from the end of her plait.\\n\\n\"Follow me, please,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"First years in front. . . no pushing.. .\\n\\nThey filed down the steps and lined up in front of the castle. It was a cold, clear evening; dusk was falling and a pale, transparent�looking moon was already shining over the Forbidden Forest. Harry, standing between Ron and Hermione in the fourth row from the front, saw Dennis Creevey positively shivering with anticipation among the other first years.\\n\\n\"Nearly six,\" said Ron, checking his watch and then staring down the drive that led to the front gates. \"How d\\'you reckon they\\'re coming? The train?\"\\n\\n\"I doubt it,\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"How, then? Broomsticks?\" Harry suggested, looking up at the starry sky.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think so. . . not from that far away.. .\\n\\n\"A Portkey?\" Ron suggested. \"Or they could Apparate � maybe you\\'re allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come from?\"\\n\\n\"You can\\'t Apparate inside the Hogwarts grounds, how often do I have to tell you?\" said Hermione impatiently.\\n\\nThey scanned the darkening grounds excitedly, but nothing was moving; everything was still, silent, and quite as usual. Harry was starting to feel cold. He wished they\\'d hurry up. .. . Maybe the foreign students were preparing a dramatic entrance. . . . He remembered what Mr. Weasley had said back at the campsite before the Quidditch World Cup: \"always the same � we can\\'t resist showing off when we get together. ..\"\\n\\nAnd then Dumbledore called out from the back row where he stood with the other teachers � \"Aha! Unless I am very much mistaken, the delegation from Beauxbatons approaches!\"\\n\\n\"Where?\" said many students eagerly, all looking in different directions.\\n\\n\"There!\" yelled a sixth year, pointing over the forest.\\n\\nSomething large, much larger than a broomstick � or, indeed, a hundred broomsticks � was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle, growing larger all the time.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a dragon!\" shrieked one of the first years, losing her head completely.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be stupid. . . it\\'s a flying house!\" said Dennis Creevey.\\n\\nDennis\\'s guess was closer. . . . As the gigantic black shape skimmed over the treetops of the Forbidden Forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it, they saw a gigantic, powderblue, horse�drawn carriage, the size of a large house, soaring toward them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses, all palominos, and each the size of an elephant.\\n\\nThe front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled ever lower, coming in to land at a tremendous speed � then, with an almighty crash that made Neville jump backward onto a Slytherin fifth year\\'s foot, the horses\\' hooves, larger than dinner plates, hit the ground. A second later, the carriage landed too, bouncing upon its vast wheels, while the golden horses tossed their enormous heads and rolled large, fiery red eyes.\\n\\nHarry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms (two crossed, golden wands, each emitting three stars) before it opened.\\n\\nA boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage, bent forward, fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor, and unfolded a set of golden steps. He sprang back respectfully. Then Harry saw a shining, high�heeled black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage � a shoe the size of a child\\'s sled � followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman he had ever seen in his life.\\n\\nThe size of the carriage, and of the horses, was immediately explained. A few people gasped.\\n\\nHarry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life, and that was Hagrid; he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights. Yet somehow � maybe simply because he was used to Hagrid � this woman (now at the foot of the steps, and looking around at the waiting, wide�eyed crowd) seemed even more unnaturally large. As she stepped into the light flooding from the entrance hall, she was revealed to have a handsome, olive�skinned face; large, black, liquid�looking eyes; and a rather beaky nose. Her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at the base of her neck. She was dressed from head to foot in black satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers.\\n\\nDumbledore started to clap; the students, following his lead, broke into applause too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman.\\n\\nHer face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward Dumbledore, extending a glittering hand. Dumbledore, though tall himself, had barely to bend to kiss it.\\n\\n\"My dear Madame Maxime,\" he said. \"Welcome to Hogwarts.\"\\n\\n\"Dumbly�dort,\" said Madame Maxime in a deep voice. \"I \\'ope I find you well?\"\\n\\n\"In excellent form, I thank you,\" said Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"My pupils,\" said Madame Maxime, waving one of her enormous hands carelessly behind her.\\n\\nHarry, whose attention had been focused completely upon Madame Maxime, now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls, all, by the look of them, in their late teens, had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind Madame Maxime. They were shivering, which was unsurprising, given that their robes seemed to be made of fine silk, and none of them were wearing cloaks. A few had wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads. From what Harry could see of them (they were standing in Madame Maxime\\'s enormous shadow), they were staring up at Hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces.\\n\\n\"As Karkaroff arrived yet?\" Madame Maxime asked.\\n\\n\"He should be here any moment,\" said Dumbledore. \"Would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle?\"\\n\\n\"Warm up, I think,\" said Madame Maxime. \"But ze \\'orses �\"\\n\\n\"Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them,\"\\n\\nsaid Dumbledore, \"the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other � er � charges.\"\\n\\n\"Skrewts,\" Ron muttered to Harry, grinning.\\n\\n\"My steeds require � er � forceful \\'andling,\" said Madame Maxime, looking as though she doubted whether any Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts could be up to the job. \"Zey are very strong. . . .\"\\n\\n\"I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job,\" said Dumbledore, smiling.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said Madame Maxime, bowing slightly. \"Will you please inform zis \\'Agrid zat ze \\'orses drink only single�malt whiskey?\"\\n\\n\"It will be attended to,\" said Dumbledore, also bowing.\\n\\n\"Come,\" said Madame Maxime imperiously to her students, and the Hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps.\\n\\n\"How big d\\'you reckon Durmstrang\\'s horses are going to be?\" Seamus Finnigan said, leaning around Lavender and Parvati to address Harry and Ron.\\n\\n\"Well, if they\\'re any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid won\\'t be able to handle them,\" said Harry. \"That\\'s if he hasn\\'t been attacked by his skrewts. Wonder what\\'s up with them?\"\\n\\n\"Maybe they\\'ve escaped,\" said Ron hopefully.\\n\\n\"Oh don\\'t say that,\" said Hermione with a shudder. \"Imagine that lot loose on the grounds. . . .\"\\n\\nThey stood, shivering slightly now, waiting for the Durmstrang party to arrive.\\n\\nMost people were gazing hopefully up at the sky.\\n\\nFor a few minutes, the silence was broken only by Madame Maxime\\'s huge horses snorting and stamping. But then � \"Can you hear something?\" said Ron suddenly.\\n\\nHarry listened; a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from out of the darkness: a muffled rumbling and sucking sound, as though an immense vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed.\\n\\n\"The lake!\" yelled Lee Jordan, pointing down at it. \"Look at the lake!\"\\n\\nFrom their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds, they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water � except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all. Some disturbance was taking place deep in the center; great bubbles were forming on the surface, waves were now washing over the muddy banks � and then, out in the very middle of the lake, a whirlpool appeared, as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake\\'s floor. .\\n\\nWhat seemed to be a long, black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of the whirlpool. . . and then Harry saw the rigging....\\n\\n\"It\\'s a mast!\" he said to Ron and Hermione.\\n\\nSlowly, magnificently, the ship rose out of the water, gleaming in the moonlight. It had a strangely skeletal look about it, as though it were a resurrected wreck, and the dim, misty lights shimmering at its portholes looked like ghostly eyes. Finally, with a great sloshing noise, the ship emerged entirely, bobbing on the turbulent water, and began to glide toward the bank. A few moments later, they heard the splash of an anchor being thrown down in the shallows, and the thud of a plank being lowered onto the bank.\\n\\nPeople were disembarking; they could see their silhouettes passing the lights in the ship\\'s portholes. All of them, Harry noticed, seemed to be built along the lines of Crabbe and Goyle... but then, as they drew nearer, walking up the lawns into the light streaming from the entrance hall, he saw that their bulk was really due to the fact that they were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy, matted fur. But the man who was leading them up to the castle was wearing furs of a different sort:\\n\\nsleek and silver, like his hair.\\n\\n\"Dumbledore!\" he called heartily as he walked up the slope. \"How are you, my dear fellow, how are you?\"\\n\\n\"Blooming, thank you, Professor Karkaroff,\" Dumbledore replied. Karkaroff had a fruity, unctuous voice; when he stepped into the light pouring from the front doors of the castle they saw that he was tall and thin like Dumbledore, but his white hair was short, and his goatee (finishing in a small curl) did not entirely hide his rather weak chin. When he reached Dumbledore, he shook hands with both of his own.\\n\\n\"Dear old Hogwarts,\" he said, looking up at the castle and smiling; his teeth were rather yellow, and Harry noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes, which remained cold and shrewd. \"How good it is to be here, how good.. . . Viktor, come along, into the warmth. . . you don\\'t mind, Dumbledore? Viktor has a slight head cold...\"\\n\\nKarkaroff beckoned forward one of his students. As the boy passed, Harry caught a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He didn\\'t need the punch on the arm Ron gave him, or the hiss in his ear, to recognize that profile.\\n\\n\"Harry � it\\'s Krum!\"\\n\\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN � THE GOBLET OF FIRE\\n\\nI don\\'t believe it!\" Ron said, in a stunned voice, as the Hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind the party from Durmstrang. \"Krum, Harry! Viktor Krum!\"\\n\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, Ron, he\\'s only a Quidditch player,\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"Only a Quidditch player?\" Ron said, looking at her as though he couldn\\'t believe his ears. \"Hermione � he\\'s one of the best Seekers in the world! I had no idea he was still at school!\"\\n\\nAs they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of the Hogwarts students heading for the Great Hall, Harry saw Lee Jordan jumping up and down on the soles of his feet to get a better look at the back of Krum\\'s head. Several sixth�year girls were frantically searching their pockets as they walked � \"Oh I don\\'t believe it, I haven\\'t got a single quill on me �\"\\n\\n\"D\\'you think he\\'d sign my hat in lipstick?\"\\n\\n\"Really,\" Hermione said loftily as they passed the girls, now squabbling over the lipstick.\\n\\n\"I\\'m getting his autograph if I can,\" said Ron. \"You haven\\'t got a quill, have you, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"Nope, they\\'re upstairs in my bag,\" said Harry.\\n\\nThey walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat down. Ron took care to sit on the side facing the doorway, because Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students were still gathered around it, apparently unsure about where they should sit. The students from Beauxbatons had chosen seats at the Ravenclaw table. They were looking around the Great Hall with glum expressions on their faces. Three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not that cold,\" said Hermione defensively. \"Why didn\\'t they bring cloaks?\"\\n\\n\"Over here! Come and sit over here!\" Ron hissed. \"Over here! Hermione, budge up, make a space �\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"Too late,\" said Ron bitterly.\\n\\nViktor Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students had settled themselves at the Slytherin table. Harry could see Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle looking very smug about this. As he watched, Malfoy bent forward to speak to Krum.\\n\\n\"Yeah, that\\'s right, smarm up to him, Malfoy,\" said Ron scathingly. \"I bet Krum can see right through him, though. . . bet he gets people fawning over him all the time.. . . Where d\\'you reckon they\\'re going to sleep? We could offer him a space in our dormitory, Harry. . . I wouldn\\'t mind giving him my bed, I could kip on a camp bed.\"\\n\\nHermione snorted.\\n\\n\"They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot,\" said Harry. The Durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up at the starry black ceiling with expressions of interest; a couple of them were picking up the golden plates and goblets and examining them, apparently impressed.\\n\\nUp at the staff table, Filch, the caretaker, was adding chairs. He was wearing his moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion. Harry was surprised to see that he added four chairs, two on either side of Dumbledore\\'s.\\n\\n\"But there are only two extra people,\" Harry said. \"Why\\'s Filch putting out four chairs, who else is coming?\"\\n\\n\"Eh?\" said Ron vaguely. He was still staring avidly at Krum.\\n\\nWhen all the students had entered the Hall and settled down at their House tables, the staff entered, filing up to the top table and taking their seats. Last in line were Professor Dumbledore, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime. When their headmistress appeared, the pupils from Beauxbatons leapt to their feet. A few of the Hogwarts students laughed. The Beauxbatons party appeared quite unembarrassed, however, and did not resume their seats until Madame Maxime had sat down on Dumbledore\\'s left�hand side. Dumbledore remained standing, and a silence fell over the Great Hall.\\n\\n\"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and � most particularly � guests,\" said Dumbledore, beaming around at the foreign students. \"I have great pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts. I hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable.\"\\n\\nOne of the Beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what was unmistakably a derisive laugh.\\n\\n\"No one\\'s making you stay!\" Hermione whispered, bristling at her.\\n\\n\"The tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast,\" said Dumbledore. \"I now invite you all to eat, drink, and make yourselves at home!\"\\n\\nHe sat down, and Harry saw Karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in conversation.\\n\\nThe plates in front of them filled with food as usual. The house�elves in the kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops; there was a greater variety of dishes in front of them than Harry had ever seen, including several that were\\n\\ndefinitely foreign.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" said Ron, pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large steak�and�kidney pudding.\\n\\n\"Bouillabaisse,\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"Bless you,\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"It\\'s French,\" said Hermione, \"I had it on holiday summer before last. It\\'s very nice.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll take your word for it,\" said Ron, helping himself to black pudding.\\n\\nThe Great Hall seemed somehow much more crowded than usual, even though there were barely twenty additional students there; perhaps it was because their differently colored uniforms stood out so clearly against the black of the Hogwarts\\' robes. Now that they had removed their furs, the Durmstrang students were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep bloodred.\\n\\nHagrid sidled into the Hall through a door behind the staff table twenty minutes after the start of the feast. He slid into his seat at the end and waved at Harry, Ron, and Hermione with a very heavily bandaged hand.\\n\\n\"Skrewts doing all right, Hagrid?\" Harry called.\\n\\n\"Thrivin\\',\" Hagrid called back happily.\\n\\n\"Yeah, I\\'ll just bet they are,\" said Ron quietly. \"Looks like they\\'ve finally found a food they like, doesn\\'t it? Hagrid\\'s fingers.\"\\n\\nAt that moment, a voice said, \"Excuse me, are you wanting ze bouillabaisse?\"\\n\\nIt was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore\\'s speech.\\n\\nShe had finally removed her muffler. A long sheet of silvery�blonde hair fell almost to her waist. She had large, deep blue eyes, and very white, even teeth.\\n\\nRon went purple. He stared up at her, opened his mouth to reply, but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noise.\\n\\n\"Yeah, have it,\" said Harry, pushing the dish toward the girl.\\n\\n\"You \\'ave finished wiz it?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" Ron said breathlessly. \"Yeah, it was excellent.\"\\n\\nThe girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the Ravenclaw table. Ron was still goggling at the girl as though he had never seen one before. Harry started to laugh. The sound seemed to jog Ron back to his senses.\\n\\n\"She\\'s a veela!\" he said hoarsely to Harry.\\n\\n\"Of course she isn\\'t!\" said Hermione tartly. \"I don\\'t see anyone else gaping at her like an idiot!\"\\n\\nBut she wasn\\'t entirely right about that. As the girl crossed the Hall, many boys\\' heads turned, and some of them seemed to have become temporarily speechless, just like Ron.\\n\\n\"I\\'m telling you, that\\'s not a normal girl!\" said Ron, leaning sideways so he could keep a clear view of her. \"They don\\'t make them like that at Hogwarts!\"\\n\\n\"They make them okay at Hogwarts,\" said Harry without thinking. Cho happened to be sitting only a few places away from the girl with the silvery hair.\\n\\n\"When you\\'ve both put your eyes back in,\" said Hermione briskly, \"you\\'ll be able to see who\\'s just arrived.\"\\n\\nShe was pointing up at the staff table. The two remaining empty seats had just been filled. Ludo Bagman was now sitting on Professor Karkaroff\\'s other side, while Mr. Crouch, Percy\\'s boss, was next to Madame Maxime.\\n\\n\"What are they doing here?\" said Harry in surprise.\\n\\n\"They organized the Triwizard Tournament, didn\\'t they?\" said Hermione. \"I suppose they wanted to be here to see it start.\"\\n\\nWhen the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar desserts too.\\n\\nRon examined an odd sort of pale blancmange closely, then moved it carefully a few inches to his right, so that it would be clearly visible from the Ravenclaw table. The girl who looked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough, however, and did not come over to get it.\\n\\nOnce the golden plates had been wiped clean, Dumbledore stood up again. A pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the Hall now. Harry felt a slight thrill of excitement, wondering what was coming. Several seats down from them, Fred and George were leaning forward, staring at Dumbledore with great concentration.\\n\\n\"The moment has come,\" said Dumbledore, smiling around at the sea of upturned faces. \"The Triwizard Tournament is about to start. I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket ��\"\\n\\n\"The what?\" Harry muttered.\\n\\nRon shrugged.\\n\\n\"� just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year. But first, let me introduce, for those who do not know them, Mr. Bartemius Crouch, Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation\" � there was a smattering of polite applause � \"and Mr. Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports.\"\\n\\nThere was a much louder round of applause for Bagman than for Crouch, perhaps because of his fame as a Beater, or simply because he looked so much more likable. He acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand. Bartemius Crouch did not smile or wave when his name was announced. Remembering him in his neat suit at the Quidditch World Cup, Harry thought he looked strange in wizard\\'s robes. His toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to Dumbledore\\'s long white hair and beard.\\n\\n\"Mr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the Triwizard Tournament,\" Dumbledore continued, \"and they will be joining myself, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime on the panel that will judge the champions\\' efforts.\"\\n\\nAt the mention of the word \"champions,\" the attentiveness of the listening students seemed to sharpen. Perhaps Dumbledore had noticed their sudden stillness, for he smiled as he said, \"The casket, then, if you please, Mr. Filch.\"\\n\\nFilch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the Hall, now approached Dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels. It looked extremely old. A murmur of excited interest rose from the watching students; Dennis Creevey actually stood on his chair to see it properly, but, being so tiny, his head hardly rose above anyone else\\'s.\\n\\n\"The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman,\" said Dumbledore as Filch placed the chest carefully on the table before him, \"and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge. There will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different ways.. their magical prowess � their daring � their powers of deduction � and, of course, their ability to cope with danger.\"\\n\\nAt this last word, the Hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed to be breathing.\\n\\n\"As you know, three champions compete in the tournament,\" Dumbledore went on calmly, \"one from each of the participating schools. They will be marked on how well they perform each of the Tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup. The champions will be chosen by an impartial selector: the Goblet of Fire.\"\\n\\nDumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the casket. The lid creaked slowly open. Dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out a large, roughly hewn wooden cup. It would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing blue�white flames.\\n\\nDumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it, where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the Hall.\\n\\n\"Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and\\n\\nschool clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet,\" said Dumbledore. \"Aspiring champions have twenty�four hours in which to put their names forward. Tomorrow night, Halloween, the goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools. The goblet will be placed in the entrance hall tonight, where it will be freely accessible to all those wishing to compete.\\n\\n\"To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation,\" said Dumbledore, \"I will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall. Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line.\\n\\n\"Finally, I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly. Once a champion has been selected by the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end.\\n\\nThe placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding, magical contract.\\n\\nThere can be no change of heart once you have become a champion. Please be very sure, therefore, that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet. Now, I think it is time for bed. Good night to you all.\"\\n\\n\"An Age Line!\" Fred Weasley said, his eyes glinting, as they all made their way across the Hall to the doors into the entrance hall. \"Well, that should be fooled by an Aging Potion, shouldn\\'t it? And once your name\\'s in that goblet, you\\'re laughing � it can\\'t tell whether you\\'re seventeen or not!\"\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance,\" said Hermione, \"we just haven\\'t learned enough. . .\"\\n\\n\"Speak for yourself,\" said George shortly. \"You\\'ll try and get in, won\\'t you, Harry?\"\\n\\nHarry thought briefly of Dumbledore\\'s insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name, but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the Triwizard Tournament filled his mind again. .. . He wondered how angry Dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get over the Age Line.\\n\\n\"Where is he?\" said Ron, who wasn\\'t listening to a word of this conversation, but looking through the crowd to see what had become of Krum. \"Dumbledore didn\\'t say where the Durmstrang people are sleeping, did he?\"\\n\\nBut this query was answered almost instantly; they were level with the Slytherin table now, and Karkaroff had just bustled up to his students.\\n\\n\"Back to the ship, then,\" he was saying. \"Viktor, how are you feeling? Did you eat enough? Should I send for some mulled wine from the kitchens?\"\\n\\nHarry saw Krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on. \"Professor, Ivood like some vine,\" said one of the other Durmstrang boys hopefully.\\n\\n\"I wasn\\'t offering it to you, Poliakoff,\" snapped Karkaroff, his warmly paternal air vanishing in an instant. \"I notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again, disgusting boy �\"\\n\\nKarkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors, reaching them at exactly the same moment as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Harry stopped to let him walk through first.\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said Karkaroff carelessly, glancing at him. And then Karkaroff froze. He turned his head back to Harry and stared at him as though he couldn\\'t believe his eyes. Behind their headmaster, the students from Durmstrang came to a halt too. Karkaroff\\'s eyes moved slowly up Harry\\'s face and fixed upon his scar.\\n\\nThe Durmstrang students were staring curiously at Harry too. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces. The boy with food all down his front nudged the girl next to him and pointed openly at Harry\\'s forehead.\\n\\n\"Yeah, that\\'s Harry Potter,\" said a growling voice from behind them.\\n\\nProfessor Karkaroff spun around. Mad�Eye Moody was standing there, leaning heavily on his staff, his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the Durmstrang headmaster.\\n\\nThe color drained from Karkaroff\\'s face as Harry watched. A terrible look of mingled fury and fear came over him.\\n\\n\"You!\" he said, staring at Moody as though unsure he was really seeing him.\\n\\n\"Me,\" said Moody grimly. \"And unless you\\'ve got anything to say to Potter, Karkaroff, you might want to move. You\\'re blocking the doorway.\"\\n\\nIt was true; half the students in the Hall were now waiting behind them, looking over one another\\'s shoulders to see what was causing the holdup.\\n\\nWithout another word, Professor Karkaroff swept his students away with him.\\n\\nMoody watched him until he was out of sight, his magical eye fixed upon his back, a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face.\\n\\nAs the next day was Saturday, most students would normally have breakfasted late. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends. When they went down into the entrance hall, they saw about twenty people milling around it, some of them eating toast, all examining the Goblet of Fire. It had been placed in the center of the hall on the stool that normally bore the Sorting Hat. A thin golden line had been traced on the floor, forming a circle ten feet around it in every direction.\\n\\n\"Anyone put their name in yet?\" Ron asked a third�year girl eagerly.\\n\\n\"All the Durmstrang lot,\" she replied. \"But I haven\\'t seen anyone from Hogwarts yet.\"\\n\\n\"Bet some of them put it in last night after we\\'d all gone to bed,\" said Harry. \"I would\\'ve if it had been me. . . wouldn\\'t have wanted everyone watching. What if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again?\"\\n\\nSomeone laughed behind Harry. Turning, he saw Fred, George, and Lee Jordan hurrying down the staircase, all three of them looking extremely excited.\\n\\n\"Done it,\" Fred said in a triumphant whisper to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Just taken it.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"The Aging Potion, dung brains,\" said Fred.\\n\\n\"One drop each,\" said George, rubbing his hands together with glee. \"We only need to be a few months older.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of us if one of us wins,\" said Lee, grinning broadly.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not sure this is going to work, you know,\" said Hermione warningly. \"I\\'m sure Dumbledore will have thought of this.\"\\n\\nFred, George, and Lee ignored her.\\n\\n\"Ready?\" Fred said to the other two, quivering with excitement. \"C\\'mon, then � I\\'ll go first �\"\\n\\nHarry watched, fascinated, as Fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket bearing the words Fred Weasley � Hogwarts. Fred walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there, rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fifty�foot drop. Then, with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him, he took a great breath and stepped over the line.\\n\\nFor a split second Harry thought it had worked � George certainly thought so, for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after Fred � but next moment, there was a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shot�putter. They landed painfully, ten feet away on the cold stone floor, and to add insult to injury, there was a loud popping noise, and both of them sprouted identical long white beards.\\n\\nThe entrance hall rang with laughter. Even Fred and George joined in, once they had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each other\\'s beards.\\n\\n\"I did warn you,\" said a deep, amused voice, and everyone turned to see Professor Dumbledore coming out of the Great Hall. He surveyed Fred and George, his eyes twinkling. \"I suggest you both go up to Madam Pomfrey. She is already tending to Miss Fawcett, of Ravenclaw, and Mr. Summers, of Hufflepuff, both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too. Though I must say, neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours.\"\\n\\nFred and George set off for the hospital wing, accompanied by Lee, who was howling with laughter, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione, also chortling, went in to breakfast.\\n\\nThe decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning. As it was Halloween, a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling, while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner. Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in,\"\\n\\nDean told Harry. \"That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth.\"\\n\\nHarry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his head in disgust.\\n\\n\"We can\\'t have a Slytherin champion!\"\\n\\n\"And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,\" said Seamus contemptuously.\\n\\n\"But I wouldn\\'t have thought he\\'d have wanted to risk his good looks.\"\\n\\n\"Listen!\" said Hermione suddenly.\\n\\nPeople were cheering out in the entrance hall. They all swiveled around in their seats and saw Angelina Johnson coming into the Hall, grinning in an embarrassed sort of way. A tall black girl who played Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Angelina came over to them, sat down, and said, \"Well, I\\'ve done it! Just put my name in!\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re kidding!\" said Ron, looking impressed.\\n\\n\"Are you seventeen, then?\" asked Harry.\\n\\n\"Course she is, can\\'t see a beard, can you?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"I had my birthday last week,\" said Angelina.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m glad someone from Gryffindor\\'s entering,\" said Hermione. \"I really hope you get it, Angelina!\"\\n\\n\"Thanks, Hermione,\" said Angelina, smiling at her.\\n\\nYeah, better you than Pretty�Boy Diggory, said Seamus, causing several Hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him.\\n\\n\"What\\'re we going to do today, then?\" Ron asked Harry and Hermione when they had finished breakfast and were leaving the Great Hall.\\n\\n\"We haven\\'t been down to visit Hagrid yet,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Okay,\" said Ron, \"just as long as he doesn\\'t ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts.\"\\n\\nA look of great excitement suddenly dawned on Hermione\\'s face.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve just realized � I haven\\'t asked Hagrid to join S.P.E.W. yet!\" she said brightly.\\n\\n\"Wait for me, will you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges?\"\\n\\n\"What is it with her?\" said Ron, exasperated, as Hermione ran away up the marble staircase.\\n\\n\"Hey, Ron,\" said Harry suddenly. \"It\\'s your friend. . .\"\\n\\nThe students from Beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the grounds, among them, the veela�girl. Those gathered around the Goblet of Fire stood back to let them pass, watching eagerly.\\n\\nMadame Maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into a line. One by one, the Beauxbatons students stepped across the Age Line and dropped their slips of parchment into the blue�white flames. As each name entered the fire, it turned briefly red and emitted sparks.\\n\\n\"What d\\'you reckon\\'ll happen to the ones who aren\\'t chosen?\" Ron muttered to Harry as the veela�girl dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire. \"Reckon they\\'ll go back to school, or hang around to watch the tournament?\"\\n\\n\"Dunno,\" said Harry. \"Hang around, I suppose... . Madame Maxime\\'s staying to judge, isn\\'t she?\"\\n\\nWhen all the Beauxbatons students had submitted their names, Madame Maxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds again.\\n\\n\"Where are they sleeping, then?\" said Ron, moving toward the front doors and staring after them.\\n\\nA loud rattling noise behind them announced Hermione\\'s reappearance with the box of S. P. E.W. badges.\\n\\n\"Oh good, hurry up,\" said Ron, and he jumped down the stone steps, keeping his eyes on the back of the veela�girl, who was now halfway across the lawn with Madame Maxime.\\n\\nAs they neared Hagrid\\'s cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, the mystery of the Beauxbatons\\' sleeping quarters was solved. The gigantic powder�blue carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from Hagrid\\'s front door, and the students were climbing back inside it. The elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it.\\n\\nHarry knocked on Hagrid\\'s door, and Fang\\'s booming barks answered instantly.\\n\\n\"Bout time!\" said Hagrid, when he\\'d flung open the door. \"Thought you lot\\'d forgotten where I live!\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ve been really busy, Hag �\" Hermione started to say, but then she stopped\\n\\ndead, looking up at Hagrid, apparently lost for words.\\n\\nHagrid was wearing his best (and very horrible) hairy brown suit, plus a checked yellow�and�orange tie. This wasn\\'t the worst of it, though; he had evidently tried to tame his hair, using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease. It was now slicked down into two bunches � perhaps he had tried a ponytail like Bill\\'s, but found he had too much hair. The look didn\\'t really suit Hagrid at all. For a moment, Hermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, she said, \"Erm � where are the skrewts.\"\\n\\n\"Out by the pumpkin patch,\" said Hagrid happily. \"They\\'re get�tin\\' massive, mus\\' be nearly three foot long now. On\\'y trouble is, they\\'ve started killin\\' each other.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no, really?\" said Hermione, shooting a repressive look at Ron, who, staring at Hagrid\\'s odd hairstyle, had just opened his mouth to say something about it.\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid sadly. \"S\\' okay, though, I\\'ve got \\'em in separate boxes now.\\n\\nStill got abou\\' twenty.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s lucky,\" said Ron. Hagrid missed the sarcasm.\\n\\nHagrid\\'s cabin comprised a single room, in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt. A similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling. They sat down at the table while Hagrid started to make tea, and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the Triwizard Tournament. Hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were.\\n\\n\"You wait,\" he said, grinning. \"You jus\\' wait. Yer going ter see some stuff yeh\\'ve never seen before. Firs\\' task. . . ah, but I\\'m not supposed ter say.\"\\n\\n\"Go on, Hagrid!\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione urged him, but he just shook his head, grinning.\\n\\n\"I don\\' want ter spoil it fer yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"But it\\'s gonna be spectacular, I\\'ll tell yeh that. Them champions\\'re going ter have their work cut out. Never thought I\\'d live ter see the Triwizard Tournament played again!\"\\n\\nThey ended up having lunch with Hagrid, though they didn\\'t eat much � Hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole, but after Hermione unearthed a large talon in hers, she, Harry, and Ron rather lost their appetites. However, they enjoyed themselves trying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament were going to be, speculating which of the entrants were likely to be selected as champions, and wondering whether Fred and George were beardless yet.\\n\\nA light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was very cozy sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window, watching Hagrid darning his socks and arguing with Hermione about house�elves � for he flatly refused to\\n\\njoin S.P.E.W. when she showed him her badges.\\n\\n\"It\\'d be doin\\' \\'em an unkindness, Hermione,\" he said gravely, threading a massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn. \"It\\'s in their nature ter look after humans, that\\'s what they like, see? Yeh\\'d be makin\\' \\'em unhappy ter take away their work, an\\' insutin\\' \\'em if yeh tried ter pay \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"But Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon about it!\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"And we heard he\\'s asking for wages now!\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, well, yeh get weirdos in every breed. I\\'m not sayin\\' there isn\\'t the odd elf who\\'d take freedom, but yeh\\'ll never persuade most of \\'em ter do it � no, nothin\\' doin\\', Hermione.\"\\n\\nHermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into her cloak pocket.\\n\\nBy half past five it was growing dark, and Ron, Harry, and Hermione decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the Halloween feast � and, more important, the announcement of the school champions.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll come with yeh,\" said Hagrid, putting away his darning. \"Jus\\' give us a sec.\"\\n\\nHagrid got up, went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed, and began searching for something inside it. They didn\\'t pay too much attention until a truly horrible smell reached their nostrils. Coughing, Ron said, \"Hagrid, what\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"Eh?\" said Hagrid, turning around with a large bottle in his hand. \"Don\\' yeh like it?\"\\n\\n\"Is that aftershave?\" said Hermione in a slightly choked voice.\\n\\n\"Er � eau de cologne,\" Hagrid muttered. He was blushing.\\n\\n\"Maybe it\\'s a bit much,\" he said gruffly. \"I\\'ll go take it off, hang on...\"\\n\\nHe stumped out of the cabin, and they saw him washing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside the window.\\n\\n\"Eau de cologne?\" said Hermione in amazement. \"Hagrid?\"\\n\\n\"And what\\'s with the hair and the suit?\" said Harry in an undertone.\\n\\n\"Look!\" said Ron suddenly, pointing out of the window. Hagrid had just straightened up and turned \\'round. If he had been blushing before, it was nothing to what he was doing now. Getting to their feet very cautiously, so that Hagrid wouldn\\'t spot them, Harry, Ron, and Hermione peered through the window and saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage, clearly about to set off for the feast too. They couldn\\'t hear what Hagrid was saying, but he was talking to Madame Maxime with a rapt, misty�eyed expression Harry had only ever seen him wear once before � when he had been\\n\\nlooking at the baby dragon, Norbert.\\n\\n\"He\\'s going up to the castle with her!\" said Hermione indignantly. \"I thought he was waiting for us!\"\\n\\nWithout so much as a backward glance at his cabin, Hagrid was trudging off up the grounds with Madame Maxime, the Beaux�batons students following in their wake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.\\n\\n\"He fancies her!\" said Ron incredulously. \"Well, if they end up having children, they\\'ll be setting a world record � bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton.\"\\n\\nThey let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them. It was surprisingly dark outside. Drawing their cloaks more closely around themselves, they set off up the sloping lawns.\\n\\n\"Ooh it\\'s them, look!\" Hermione whispered.\\n\\nThe Durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from the lake. Viktor Krum was walking side by side with Karkaroff, and the other Durmstrang students were straggling along behind them. Ron watched Krum excitedly, but Krum did not look around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of Hermione, Ron, and Harry and proceeded through them.\\n\\nWhen they entered the candlelit Great Hall it was almost full. The Goblet of Fire had been moved; it was now standing in front of Dumbledore\\'s empty chair at the teachers\\' table. Fred and George � clean�shaven again � seemed to have taken their disappointment fairly well.\\n\\n\"Hope it\\'s Angelina,\" said Fred as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down.\\n\\n\"So do I!\" said Hermione breathlessly. \"Well, we\\'ll soon know!\"\\n\\nThe Halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual. Perhaps because it was their second feast in two days, Harry didn\\'t seem to fancy the extravagantly prepared food as much as he would have normally. Like everyone else in the Hall, judging by the constantly craning necks, the impatient expressions on every face, the fidgeting, and the standing up to see whether Dumbledore had finished eating yet, Harry simply wanted the plates to clear, and to hear who had been selected as champions.\\n\\nAt long last, the golden plates returned to their original spotless state; there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall, which died away almost instantly as Dumbledore got to his feet. On either side of him, Professor Karkaroff and Madame Maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone. Ludo Bagman was beaming and winking at various students. Mr. Crouch, however, looked quite uninterested, almost bored.\\n\\n\"Well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision,\" said Dumbledore. \"I estimate that it requires one more minute. Now, when the champions\\' names are\\n\\ncalled, I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall, walk along the staff table, and go through into the next chamber\" � he indicated the door behind the staff table � \"where they will be receiving their first instructions.\"\\n\\nHe took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it; at once, all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished, plunging them into a state of semidarkness. The Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly than anything in the whole Hall, the sparkling bright, bluey�whiteness of the flames almost painful on the eyes. Everyone watched, waiting. . . . A few people kept checking their watches. . .\\n\\n\"Any second,\" Lee Jordan whispered, two seats away from Harry.\\n\\nThe flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again. Sparks began to fly from it. Next moment, a tongue of flame shot into the air, a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it � the whole room gasped.\\n\\nDumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arm\\'s length, so that he could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to blue�white.\\n\\n\"The champion for Durmstrang,\" he read, in a strong, clear voice, \"will be Viktor Krum.\"\\n\\n\"No surprises there!\" yelled Ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the Hall. Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up toward Dumbledore; he turned right, walked along the staff table, and disappeared through the door into the next chamber.\\n\\n\"Bravo, Viktor!\" boomed Karkaroff, so loudly that everyone could hear him, even over all the applause. \"Knew you had it in you!\"\\n\\nThe clapping and chatting died down. Now everyone\\'s attention was focused again on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more. A second piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames.\\n\\n\"The champion for Beauxbatons,\" said Dumbledore, \"is Fleur Delacour!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s her, Ron!\" Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.\\n\\n\"Oh look, they\\'re all disappointed,\" Hermione said over the noise, nodding toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. \"Disappointed\" was a bit of an understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.\\n\\nWhen Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it. The Hogwarts champion next...\\n\\nAnd the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered out of it; the tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the third piece of parchment.\\n\\n\"The Hogwarts champion,\" he called, \"is Cedric Diggory!\"\\n\\n\"No! \" said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them, grinning broadly, and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers\\' table. Indeed, the applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some time before Dumbledore could make himself heard again.\\n\\n\"Excellent!\" Dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down. \"Well, we now have our three champions. I am sure I can count upon all of you, including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering your champion on, you will contribute in a very real ��\"\\n\\nBut Dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking, and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted him.\\n\\nThe fire in the goblet had just turned red again. Sparks were flying out of it. A long flame shot suddenly into the air, and borne upon it was another piece of parchment.\\n\\nAutomatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment. He held it out and stared at the name written upon it. There was a long pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared at Dumbledore. And then Dumbledore cleared his throat and read out � \"Harry Potter.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN � THE FOUR CHAMPIONS\\n\\nHarry sat there, aware that every head in the Great Hall had turned to look at him.\\n\\nHe was stunned. He felt numb. He was surely dreaming. He had not heard correctly.\\n\\nThere was no applause. A buzzing, as though of angry bees, was starting to fill the Hall; some students were standing up to get a better look at Harry as he sat, frozen, in his seat.\\n\\nUp at the top table, Professor McGonagall had got to her feet and swept past Ludo Bagman and Professor Karkaroff to whisper urgently to Professor Dumbledore, who bent his ear toward her, frowning slightly.\\n\\nHarry turned to Ron and Hermione; beyond them, he saw the long Gryffindor table all watching him, openmouthed.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t put my name in,\" Harry said blankly. \"You know I didn\\'t.\"\\n\\nBoth of them stared just as blankly back.\\n\\nAt the top table, Professor Dumbledore had straightened up, nodding to Professor McGonagall.\\n\\n\"Harry Potter!\" he called again. \"Harry! Up here, if you please!\"\\n\\n\"Go on,\" Hermione whispered, giving Harry a slight push.\\n\\nHarry got to his feet, trod on the hem of his robes, and stumbled slightly. He set off up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables. It felt like an immensely long walk; the top table didn\\'t seem to be getting any nearer at all, and he could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon him, as though each were a searchlight. The buzzing grew louder and louder. After what seemed like an hour, he was right in front of Dumbledore, feeling the stares of all the teachers upon him.\\n\\n\"Well.. . through the door, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. He wasn\\'t smiling.\\n\\nHarry moved off along the teachers\\' table. Hagrid was seated right at the end. He did not wink at Harry, or wave, or give any of his usual signs of greeting. He looked completely astonished and stared at Harry as he passed like everyone else.\\n\\nHarry went through the door out of the Great Hall and found himself in a smaller room, lined with paintings of witches and wizards. A handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace opposite him.\\n\\nThe faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered. He saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into the one next to it, which\\n\\ncontained a wizard with a walrus mustache. The wizened witch started whispering in his ear.\\n\\nViktor Krum, Cedric Diggory, and Fleur Delacour were grouped around the fire.\\n\\nThey looked strangely impressive, silhouetted against the flames. Krum, hunched� up and brooding, was leaning against the mantelpiece, slightly apart from the other two. Cedric was standing with his hands behind his back, staring into the fire.\\n\\nFleur Delacour looked around when Harry walked in and threw back her sheet of long, silvery hair.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" she said. \"Do zey want us back in ze Hall?\"\\n\\nShe thought he had come to deliver a message. Harry didn\\'t know how to explain what had just happened. He just stood there, looking at the three champions. It struck him how very tall all of them were.\\n\\nThere was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and Ludo Bagman entered the room. He took Harry by the arm and led him forward.\\n\\n\"Extraordinary!\" he muttered, squeezing Harry\\'s arm. \"Absolutely extraordinary!\\n\\nGentlemen. . . lady,\" he added, approaching the fireside and addressing the other three. \"May I introduce � incredible though it may seem � the fourth Triwizard champion?\"\\n\\nViktor Krum straightened up. His surly face darkened as he surveyed Harry.\\n\\nCedric looked nonplussed. He looked from Bagman to Harry and back again as though sure he must have misheard what Bagman had said. Fleur Delacour, however, tossed her hair, smiling, and said, \"Oh, vairy funny joke, Meester Bagman.\"\\n\\n\"Joke?\" Bagman repeated, bewildered. \"No, no, not at all! Harry\\'s name just came out of the Goblet of Fire!\"\\n\\nKrum\\'s thick eyebrows contracted slightly. Cedric was still looking politely bewildered. Fleur frowned.\\n\\n\"But evidently zair \\'as been a mistake,\" she said contemptuously to Bagman. \"E cannot compete. \\'E is too young.\"\\n\\n\"Well. . . it is amazing,\" said Bagman, rubbing his smooth chin and smiling down at Harry. \"But, as you know, the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure. And as his name\\'s come out of the goblet.. . I mean, I don\\'t think there can be any ducking out at this stage. . . . It\\'s down in the rules, you\\'re obliged. . . Harry will just have to do the best he ��\"\\n\\nThe door behind them opened again, and a large group of people came in: Professor Dumbledore, followed closely by Mr. Crouch, Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Snape. Harry heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall, before Professor\\n\\nMcGonagall closed the door.\\n\\n\"Madame Maxime!\" said Fleur at once, striding over to her headmistress. \"Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!\"\\n\\nSomewhere under Harry\\'s numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger. Little boy!\\n\\nMadame Maxime had drawn herself up to her full, and considerable, height. The top of her handsome head brushed the candle�filled chandelier, and her gigantic black�satin bosom swelled.\\n\\n\"What is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly�dorr?\" she said imperiously. \"I\\'d rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,\" said Professor Karkaroff. He was wearing a steely smile, and his blue eyes were like chips of ice. \"Two Hogwarts champions!\\n\\nI don\\'t remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions � or have I not read the rules carefully enough?\"\\n\\nHe gave a short and nasty laugh.\\n\\n\"C\\'est impossible,\" said Madame Maxime, whose enormous hand with its many superb opals was resting upon Fleur\\'s shoulder. \"Ogwarts cannot \\'ave two champions. It is most injust.\"\\n\\n\"We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out younger contestants, Dumbledore,\" said Karkaroff, his steely smile still in place, though his eyes were colder than ever. \"Otherwise, we would, of course, have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s no one\\'s fault but Potter\\'s, Karkaroff,\" said Snape softly. His black eyes were alight with malice. \"Don\\'t go blaming Dumbledore for Potter\\'s determination to break rules. He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here �\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Severus,\" said Dumbledore firmly, and Snape went quiet, though his eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain of greasy black hair.\\n\\nProfessor Dumbledore was now looking down at Harry, who looked right back at him, trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the half�moon spectacles.\\n\\n\"Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?\" he asked calmly.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry. He was very aware of everybody watching him closely. Snape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the shadows.\\n\\n\"Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you?\" said Professor Dumbledore, ignoring Snape.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry vehemently.\\n\\n\"Ah, but of course \\'e is lying!\" cried Madame Maxime. Snape was now shaking his head, his lip curling.\\n\\n\"He could not have crossed the Age Line,\" said Professor McGonagall sharply. \"I am sure we are all agreed on that �\"\\n\\n\"Dumbly�dorr must \\'ave made a mistake wiz ze line,\" said Madame Maxime, shrugging.\\n\\n\"It is possible, of course,\" said Dumbledore politely.\\n\\n\"Dumbledore, you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake!\" said Professor McGonagall angrily. \"Really, what nonsense! Harry could not have crossed the line himself, and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him, I\\'m sure that should be good enough for everybody else!\"\\n\\nShe shot a very angry look at Professor Snape.\\n\\n\"Mr. Crouch.. . Mr. Bagman,\" said Karkaroff, his voice unctuous once more, \"you are our � er � objective judges. Surely you will agree that this is most irregular?\"\\n\\nBagman wiped his round, boyish face with his handkerchief and looked at Mr.\\n\\nCrouch, who was standing outside the circle of the firelight, his face half hidden in shadow. He looked slightly eerie, the half darkness making him look much older, giving him an almost skull�like appearance. When he spoke, however, it was in his usual curt voice.\\n\\n\"We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,\" said Bagman, beaming and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter was now closed.\\n\\n\"I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,\" said Karkaroff.\\n\\nHe had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now. His face wore a very ugly look indeed. \"You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more, and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions. It\\'s only fair, Dumbledore.\"\\n\\n\"But Karkaroff, it doesn\\'t work like that,\" said Bagman. \"The Goblet of Fire\\'s just gone out � it won\\'t reignite until the start of the next tournament �\"\\n\\n\"� in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing!\" exploded Karkaroff. \"After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little expected something of this nature to occur! I have half a mind to leave now!\"\\n\\n\"Empty threat, Karkaroff,\" growled a voice from near the door. \"You can\\'t leave your champion now. He\\'s got to compete. They\\'ve all got to compete. Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh?\"\\n\\nMoody had just entered the room. He limped toward the fire, and with every right step he took, there was a loud clunk.\\n\\n\"Convenient?\" said Karkaroff. \"I\\'m afraid I don\\'t understand you, Moody.\"\\n\\nHarry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though what Moody was saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands gave him away; they had balled themselves into fists.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you?\" said Moody quietly. \"It\\'s very simple, Karkaroff. Someone put Potter\\'s name in that goblet knowing he\\'d have to compete if it came out.\"\\n\\n\"Evidently, someone \\'oo wished to give \\'Ogwarts two bites at ze apple!\" said Madame Maxime.\\n\\n\"I quite agree, Madame Maxime,\" said Karkaroff, bowing to her. \"I shall be lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation of Wizards �\"\\n\\n\"If anyone\\'s got reason to complain, it\\'s Potter,\" growled Moody, \"but. . . funny thing. . . I don\\'t hear him saying a word. . .\\n\\n\"Why should \\'e complain?\" burst out Fleur Delacour, stamping her foot. \"E \\'as ze chance to compete, \\'asn\\'t \\'e? We \\'ave all been \\'oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks! Ze honor for our schools! A thousand Galleons in prize money � zis is a chance many would die for!\"\\n\\n\"Maybe someone\\'s hoping Potter is going to die for it,\" said Moody, with the merest trace of a growl.\\n\\nAn extremely tense silence followed these words. Ludo Bagman, who was looking very anxious indeed, bounced nervously up and down on his feet and said, \"Moody, old man. . . what a thing to say!\"\\n\\n\"We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he hasn\\'t discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime,\" said Karkaroff loudly.\\n\\n\"Apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too. An odd quality in a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dumbledore, but no doubt you had your reasons.\\n\\n\"Imagining things, am I?\" growled Moody. \"Seeing things, eh? It was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boy\\'s name in that goblet. . .\\n\\n\"Ah, what evidence is zere of zat?\" said Madame Maxime, throwing up her huge hands.\\n\\n\"Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object!\" said Moody. \"It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament.. . . I\\'m guessing they submitted Potter\\'s name under a fourth school, to make sure he was the only one in his category.. . .\"\\n\\n\"You seem to have given this a great deal of thought, Moody,\" said Karkaroff\\n\\ncoldly, \"and a very ingenious theory it is � though of course, I heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg, and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock. So you\\'ll understand if we don\\'t take you entirely seriously. . . .\"\\n\\n\"There are those who\\'ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage,\" Moody retorted in a menacing voice. \"It\\'s my job to think the way Dark wizards do, Karkaroff � as you ought to remember...\\n\\n\"Alastor!\" said Dumbledore warningly. Harry wondered for a moment whom he was speaking to, but then realized \"Mad�Eye\" could hardly be Moody\\'s real first name. Moody fell silent, though still surveying Karkaroff with satisfaction � Karkaroff\\'s face was burning.\\n\\n\"How this situation arose, we do not know,\" said Dumbledore, speaking to everyone gathered in the room. \"It seems to me, however, that we have no choice but to accept it. Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to compete in the Tournament. This, therefore, they will do. . .\\n\\n\"Ah, but Dumbly�dorr �\"\\n\\n\"My dear Madame Maxime, if you have an alternative, I would be delighted to hear it.\"\\n\\nDumbledore waited, but Madame Maxime did not speak, she merely glared. She wasn\\'t the only one either. Snape looked furious; Karkaroff livid; Bagman, however, looked rather excited.\\n\\n\"Well, shall we crack on, then?\" he said, rubbing his hands together and smiling around the room. \"Got to give our champions their instructions, haven\\'t we? Barty, want to do the honors?\"\\n\\nMr. Crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverie.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"instructions. Yes . . . the first task . . .\"\\n\\nHe moved forward into the firelight. Close up, Harry thought he looked ill. There were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin, papery look about his wrinkled skin that had not been there at the Quidditch World Cup.\\n\\n\"The first task is designed to test your daring,\" he told Harry, Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor, \"so we are not going to be telling you what it is. Courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a wizard. . . very important.\\n\\n\"The first task will take place on November the twenty�fourth, in front of the other students and the panel of judges.\\n\\n\"The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament. The champions will face the first challenge armed only with their wands. They will receive information about the\\n\\nsecond task when the first is over. Owing to the demanding and time�consuming nature of the tournament, the champions are exempted from end�of�year tests.\"\\n\\nMr. Crouch turned to look at Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"I think that\\'s all, is it, Albus?\"\\n\\n\"I think so,\" said Dumbledore, who was looking at Mr. Crouch with mild concern.\\n\\n\"Are you sure you wouldn\\'t like to stay at Hogwarts tonight, Barty?\"\\n\\n\"No, Dumbledore, I must get back to the Ministry,\" said Mr. Crouch. \"It is a very busy, very difficult time at the moment.... I\\'ve left young Weatherby in charge.. . .\\n\\nVery enthusiastic. . . a little overenthusiastic, if truth be told. . .\\n\\n\"You\\'ll come and have a drink before you go, at least?\" said Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"Come on, Barry, I\\'m staying!\" said Bagman brightly. \"It\\'s all happening at Hogwarts now, you know, much more exciting here than at the office!\"\\n\\n\"I think not, Ludo,\" said Crouch with a touch of his old impatience.\\n\\n\"Professor Karkaroff � Madame Maxime � a nightcap?\" said Dumbledore.\\n\\nBut Madame Maxime had already put her arm around Fleur\\'s shoulders and was leading her swiftly out of the room. Harry could hear them both talking very fast in French as they went off into the Great Hall. Karkaroff beckoned to Krum, and they, too, exited, though in silence.\\n\\n\"Harry, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed,\" said Dumbledore, smiling at both of them. \"I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you, and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise.\"\\n\\nHarry glanced at Cedric, who nodded, and they left together.\\n\\nThe Great Hall was deserted now; the candles had burned low, giving the jagged smiles of the pumpkins an eerie, flickering quality.\\n\\n\"So,\" said Cedric, with a slight smile. \"We\\'re playing against each other again!\"\\n\\n\"I s\\'pose,\" said Harry. He really couldn\\'t think of anything to say. The inside of his head seemed to be in complete disarray, as though his brain had been ransacked.\\n\\n\"So. . . tell me. . .\" said Cedric as they reached the entrance hall, which was now lit only by torches in the absence of the Goblet of Fire. \"How did you get your name in?\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t,\" said Harry, staring up at him. \"I didn\\'t put it in. I was telling the truth.\"\\n\\n\"Ah. . . okay,\" said Cedric. Harry could tell Cedric didn\\'t believe him. \"Well . . .\\n\\nsee you, then.\"\\n\\nInstead of going up the marble staircase, Cedric headed for a door to its right.\\n\\nHarry stood listening to him going down the stone steps beyond it, then, slowly, he started to climb the marble ones.\\n\\nWas anyone except Ron and Hermione going to believe him, or would they all think he\\'d put himself in for the tournament? Yet how could anyone think that, when he was facing competitors who\\'d had three years\\' more magical education than he had � when he was now facing tasks that not only sounded very dangerous, but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of people? Yes, he\\'d thought about it. . . he\\'d fantasized about it.. . but it had been a joke, really, an idle sort of dream. . . he\\'d never really, seriously considered entering. .\\n\\nBut someone else had considered it. . . someone else had wanted him in the tournament, and had made sure he was entered. Why? To give him a treat? He didn\\'t think so, somehow...\\n\\nTo see him make a fool of himself? Well, they were likely to get their wish. .\\n\\nBut to get him killed!\\n\\nWas Moody just being his usual paranoid self? Couldn\\'t someone have put Harry\\'s name in the goblet as a trick, a practical joke? Did anyone really want him dead!\\n\\nHarry was able to answer that at once. Yes, someone wanted him dead, someone had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year old. . . Lord Voldemort. But how could Voldemort have ensured that Harry\\'s name got into the Goblet of Fire!\\n\\nVoldemort was supposed to be far away, in some distant country, in hiding, alone.\\n\\n. . feeble and powerless....\\n\\nYet in that dream he had had, just before he had awoken with his scar hurting, Voldemort had not been alone. . . he had been talking to Wormtail.. . plotting Harry\\'s murder.\\n\\nHarry got a shock to find himself facing the Fat Lady already. He had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him. It was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbor\\'s painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest.\\n\\n\"Well, well, well,\" said the Fat Lady, \"Violet\\'s just told me everything. Who\\'s just been chosen as school champion, then?\"\\n\\n\"Balderdash,\" said Harry dully.\\n\\n\"It most certainly isn\\'t!\" said the pale witch indignantly.\\n\\n\"No, no, Vi, it\\'s the password,\" said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room.\\n\\nThe blast of noise that met Harry\\'s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.\\n\\n\"You should\\'ve told us you\\'d entered!\" bellowed Fred; he looked half annoyed, half deeply impressed.\\n\\n\"How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!\" roared George.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t,\" Harry said. \"I don\\'t know how �\"\\n\\nBut Angelina had now swooped down upon him; \"Oh if it couldn\\'t be me, at least it\\'s a Gryffindor �\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match, Harry!\"\\n\\nshrieked Katie Bell, another of the Gryffindor Chasers.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got food, Harry, come and have some �\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not hungry, I had enough at the feast �\"\\n\\nBut nobody wanted to hear that he wasn\\'t hungry; nobody wanted to hear that he hadn\\'t put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to have noticed that he wasn\\'t at all in the mood to celebrate. . . . Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it around Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn\\'t get away; whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks, forcing another butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands. . . . Everyone wanted to know how he had done it, how he had tricked Dumbledore\\'s Age Line and managed to get his name into the goblet....\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t,\" he said, over and over again, \"I don\\'t know how it happened.\"\\n\\nBut for all the notice anyone took, he might just as well not have answered at all.\\n\\n\"I\\'m tired!\" he bellowed finally, after nearly half an hour. \"No, seriously, George � I\\'m going to bed �\"\\n\\nHe wanted more than anything to find Ron and Hermione, to find a bit of sanity, but neither of them seemed to be in the common room. Insisting that he needed to sleep, and almost flattening the little Creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs, Harry managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as he could.\\n\\nTo his great relief, he found Ron was lying on his bed in the otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed. He looked up when Harry slammed the door behind him.\\n\\n\"Where\\'ve you been?\" Harry said.\\n\\n\"Oh hello,\" said Ron.\\n\\nHe was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin. Harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it was knotted very tightly. Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.\\n\\n\"So,\" he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner. \"Congratulations.\"\\n\\n\"What d\\'you mean, congratulations?\" said Harry, staring at Ron. There was definitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling: It was more like a grimace.\\n\\n\"Well. . . no one else got across the Age Line,\" said Ron. \"Not even Fred and George. What did you use � the Invisibility Cloak?\"\\n\\n\"The Invisibility Cloak wouldn\\'t have got me over that line,\" said Harry slowly.\\n\\n\"Oh right,\" said Ron. \"I thought you might\\'ve told me if it was the cloak. . .\\n\\nbecause it would\\'ve covered both of us, wouldn\\'t it? But you found another way, did you?\"\\n\\n\"Listen,\" said Harry, \"I didn\\'t put my name in that goblet. Someone else must\\'ve done it.\"\\n\\nRon raised his eyebrows.\\n\\n\"What would they do that for?\"\\n\\n\"I dunno,\" said Harry. He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, \"To kill me.\"\\n\\nRon\\'s eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair.\\n\\n\"It\\'s okay, you know, you can tell me the truth,\" he said. \"If you don\\'t want everyone else to know, fine, but I don\\'t know why you\\'re bothering to lie, you didn\\'t get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady\\'s, that Violet, she\\'s already told us all Dumbledore\\'s letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? And you don\\'t have to do end�of�year tests either. . .\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t put my name in that goblet!\" said Harry, starting to feel angry.\\n\\n\"Yeah, okay,\" said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric. \"Only you said this morning you\\'d have done it last night, and no one would\\'ve seen you.. . .\\n\\nI\\'m not stupid, you know.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re doing a really good impression of it,\" Harry snapped.\\n\\n\"Yeah?\" said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his face now. \"You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect you\\'ll need to be up early\\n\\ntomorrow for a photo�call or something.\"\\n\\nHe wrenched the hangings shut around his four�poster, leaving Harry standing there by the door, staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding one of the few people he had been sure would believe him.\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN � THE WEIGHING OF THE WANDS\\n\\nWhen Harry woke up on Sunday morning, it took him a moment to remember why he felt so miserable and worried. Then the memory of the previous night rolled over him. He sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own four�poster, intending to talk to Ron, to force Ron to believe him � only to find that Ron\\'s bed was empty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast.\\n\\nHarry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room. The moment he appeared, the people who had already finished breakfast broke into applause again. The prospect of going down into the Great Hall and facing the rest of the Gryffindors, all treating him like some sort of hero, was not inviting; it was that, however, or stay here and allow himself to be cornered by the Creevey brothers, who were both beckoning frantically to him to join them. He walked resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open, climbed out of it, and found himself face�to�face with Hermione.\\n\\n\"Hello,\" she said, holding up a stack of toast, which she was carrying in a napkin.\\n\\n\"I brought you this. . . . Want to go for a walk?\"\\n\\n\"Good idea,\" said Harry gratefully.\\n\\nThey went downstairs, crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking in at the Great Hall, and were soon striding across the lawn toward the lake, where the Durmstrang ship was moored, reflected blackly in the water. It was a chilly morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as Harry told Hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before.\\n\\nTo his immense relief, Hermione accepted his story without question.\\n\\n\"Well, of course I knew you hadn\\'t entered yourself,\" she said when he\\'d finished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the Hall. \"The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name! But the question is, who did put it in!\\n\\nBecause Moody\\'s right, Harry... I don\\'t think any student could have done it. . .\\n\\nthey\\'d never be able to fool the Goblet, or get over Dumbledore\\'s �\"\\n\\n\"Have you seen Ron?\" Harry interrupted.\\n\\nHermione hesitated.\\n\\n\"Erm. . . yes. . . he was at breakfast,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Does he still think I entered myself?\"\\n\\n\"Well. . . no, I don\\'t think so . . . not really,\" said Hermione awkwardly.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that supposed to mean, \\'not really\\'?\"\\n\\n\"Oh Harry, isn\\'t it obvious?\" Hermione said despairingly. \"He\\'s jealous!\"\\n\\n\"Jealous?\" Harry said incredulously. \"Jealous of what? He wants to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school, does he?\"\\n\\n\"Look,\" said Hermione patiently, \"it\\'s always you who gets all the attention, you know it is. I know it\\'s not your fault,\" she added quickly, seeing Harry open his mouth furiously. \"I know you don\\'t ask for it.. . but � well � you know, Ron\\'s got all those brothers to compete against at home, and you\\'re his best friend, and you\\'re really famous � he\\'s always shunted to one side whenever people see you, and he puts up with it, and he never mentions it, but I suppose this is just one time too many. . .\\n\\n\"Great,\" said Harry bitterly. \"Really great. Tell him from me I\\'ll swap any time he wants. Tell him from me he\\'s welcome to it.... People gawping at my forehead everywhere I go. . .\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not teiling him anything,\" Hermione said shortly. \"Tell him yourself. It\\'s the only way to sort this out.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not running around after him trying to make him grow up!\" Harry said, so loudly that several owls in a nearby tree took flight in alarm. \"Maybe he\\'ll believe I\\'m not enjoying myself once I\\'ve got my neck broken or �\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not funny,\" said Hermione quietly. \"That\\'s not funny at all.\" She looked extremely anxious. \"Harry, I\\'ve been thinking � you know what we\\'ve got to do, don\\'t you? Straight away, the moment we get back to the castle?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, give Ron a good kick up the �\"\\n\\n\"Write to Sirius. You\\'ve got to tell him what\\'s happened. He asked you to keep him posted on everything that\\'s going on at Hogwarts. . . . It\\'s almost as if he expected something like this to happen. I brought some parchment and a quill out with me �\"\\n\\n\"Come off it,\" said Harry, looking around to check that they couldn\\'t be overheard, but the grounds were quite deserted. \"He came back to the country just because my scar twinged. He\\'ll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone\\'s entered me in the Triwizard Tournament �\"\\n\\n\"He\\'d want you to tell him,\" said Hermione sternly. \"He\\'s going to find out anyway.\"\\n\\n\"How?\"\\n\\n\"Harry, this isn\\'t going to be kept quiet,\" said Hermione, very seriously. \"This tournament\\'s famous, and you\\'re famous. I\\'ll be really surprised if there isn\\'t anything in the Daily Prophet about you competing. . . . You\\'re already in half the books about You�Know�Who, you know.. . and Sirius would rather hear it from you, I know he would.\"\\n\\n\"Okay, okay, I\\'ll write to him,\" said Harry, throwing his last piece of toast into the lake. They both stood and watched it floating there for a moment, before a large tentacle rose out of the water and scooped it beneath the surface. Then they returned to the castle.\\n\\n\"Whose owl am I going to use?\" Harry said as they climbed the stairs. \"He told me not to use Hedwig again.\"\\n\\n\"Ask Ron if you can borrow �\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not asking Ron for anything,\" Harry said flatly.\\n\\n\"Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use them,\" said Hermione.\\n\\nThey went up to the Owlery. Hermione gave Harry a piece of parchment, a quill, and a bottle of ink, then strolled around the long lines of perches, looking at all the different owls, while Harry sat down against a wall and wrote his letter.\\n\\nDear Sirius, You told me to keep you posted on what\\'s happening at Hogwarts, so here goes � I don\\'t know if you\\'ve heard, but the Triwizard Tournament\\'s happening this year and on Saturday night I got picked as a fourth champion. I don\\'t who put my name in the Goblet of Fire, because I didn\\'t. The other Hogwarts champion is Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff He paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night, but he couldn\\'t think how to translate this into words, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote, Hope you\\'re okay, and Buckbeak � Harry \"Finished,\" he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes.\\n\\nAt this, Hedwig fluttered down onto his shoulder and held out her leg.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t use you,\" Harry told her, looking around for the school owls. \"I\\'ve got to use one of these.\"\\n\\nHedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her talons cut into his shoulder. She kept her back to Harry all the time he was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl. When the barn owl had flown off, Harry reached out to stroke Hedwig, but she clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the rafters out of reach.\\n\\n\"First Ron, then you,\" Harry said angrily. \"This isn\\'t my fault.\"\\n\\nIf Harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of him being champion, the following day showed him how mistaken he was.\\n\\nHe could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessons � and it\\n\\nwas clear that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors, thought Harry had entered himself for the tournament. Unlike the Gryffindors, however, they did not seem impressed.\\n\\nThe Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the Gryffindors, had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them. One Herbology lesson was enough to demonstrate this. It was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their champion\\'s glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin FinchFletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray � though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry\\'s grip and smacked him hard in the face. Ron wasn\\'t talking to Harry either. Hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though both answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him � but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.\\n\\nHe would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under normal circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too � the first time he would come face�to�face with them since becoming champion.\\n\\nPredictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid\\'s cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in place.\\n\\n\"Ah, look, boys, it\\'s the champion,\" he said to Crabbe and Goyle the moment he got within earshot of Harry. \"Got your autograph books? Better get a signature now, because I doubt he\\'s going to be around much longer. . . . Half the Triwizard champions have died.. . how long d\\'you reckon you\\'re going to last, Potter? Ten minutes into the first task\\'s my bet.\"\\n\\nCrabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfoy had to stop there, because Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower of crates, each containing a very large Blast�Ended Skrewt. To the class\\'s horror, Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was an excess of pent�up energy, and that the solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk. The only good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy completely.\\n\\n\"Take this thing for a walk?\" he repeated in disgust, staring into one of the boxes.\\n\\n\"And where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash? Around the sting, the blasting end, or the sucker?\"\\n\\n\"Roun\\' the middle,\" said Hagrid, demonstrating. \"Er � yeh might want ter put on yer dragon�hide gloves, jus\\' as an extra precaution, like. Harry � you come here an\\' help me with this big one....\\n\\nHagrid\\'s real intention, however, was totalk to Harry away from the rest of the class. He waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then turned to Harry and said, very seriously, \"So � yer competin\\', Harry. In the tournament.\\n\\nSchool champion.\"\\n\\n\"One of the champions,\" Harry corrected him.\\n\\nHagrid\\'s beetle�black eyes looked very anxious under his wild eyebrows.\\n\\n\"No idea who put yeh in fer it, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"You believe I didn\\'t do it, then?\" said Harry, concealing with difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt at Hagrid\\'s words.\\n\\n\"Course I do,\" Hagrid grunted. \"Yeh say it wasn\\' you, an\\' I believe yeh � an\\' Dumbledore believes yer, an\\' all.\"\\n\\n\"Wish I knew who did do it,\" said Harry bitterly.\\n\\nThe pair of them looked out over the lawn; the class was widely scattered now, and all in great difficulty. The skrewts were now over three feet long, and extremely powerful. No longer shell�less and colorless, they had developed a kind of thick, grayish, shiny armor. They looked like a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs � but still without recognizable heads or eyes. They had become immensely strong and very hard to control.\\n\\n\"Look like they\\'re havin\\' fun, don\\' they?\" Hagrid said happily. Harry assumed he was talking about the skrewts, because his classmates certainly weren\\'t; every now and then, with an alarming bang, one of the skrewts\\' ends would explode, causing it to shoot forward several yards, and more than one person was being dragged along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back on their feet.\\n\\n\"Ah, I don\\' know, Harry,\" Hagrid sighed suddenly, looking back down at him with a worried expression on his face. \"School champion. . . everythin\\' seems ter happen ter you, doesn\\' it?\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t answer. Yes, everything did seem to happen to him. . . that was more or less what Hermione had said as they had walked around the lake, and that was the reason, according to her, that Ron was no longer talking to him.\\n\\nThe next few days were some of Harry\\'s worst at Hogwarts. The closest he had ever come to feeling like this had been during those months, in his second year, when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow students.\\n\\nBut Ron had been on his side then. He thought he could have coped with the rest of the school\\'s behavior if he could just have had Ron back as a friend, but he wasn\\'t going to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron didn\\'t want to.\\n\\nNevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all sides.\\n\\nHe could understand the Hufflepuffs\\' attitude, even if he didn\\'t like it; they had their own champion to support. He expected nothing less than vicious insults from\\n\\nthe Slytherins � he was highly unpopular there and always had been, because he had helped Gryffindor beat them so often, both at Quidditch and in the Inter� House Championship. But he had hoped the Ravenclaws might have found it in their hearts to support him as much as Cedric. He was wrong, however. Most Ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name.\\n\\nThen there was the fact that Cedric looked the part of a champion so much more than he did. Exceptionally handsome, with his straight nose, dark hair, and gray eyes, it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days, Cedric or Viktor Krum. Harry actually saw the same sixth�year girls who had been so keen to get Krum\\'s autograph begging Cedric to sign their school bags one lunchtime.\\n\\nMeanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig was refusing to come anywhere near him, Professor Trelawney was predicting his death with even more certainty than usual, and he did so badly at Summoning Charms in Professor Flitwick\\'s class that he was given extra homework � the only person to get any, apart from Neville.\\n\\n\"It\\'s really not that difficult, Harry,\" Hermione tried to reassure him as they left Flitwick\\'s class � she had been making objects zoom across the room to her all lesson, as though she were some sort of weird magnet for board dusters, wastepaper baskets, and lunascopes. \"You just weren\\'t concentrating properly �\"\\n\\n\"Wonder why that was,\" said Harry darkly as Cedric Diggory walked past, surrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of whom looked at Harry as though he were a particularly large Blast�Ended Skrewt. \"Still � never mind, eh!\\n\\nDouble Potions to look forward to this afternoon. . .\"\\n\\nDouble Potions was always a horrible experience, but these days it was nothing short of torture. Being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with Snape and the Slytherins, all of whom seemed determined to punish Harry as much as possible for daring to become school champion, was about the most unpleasant thing Harry could imagine. He had already struggled through one Friday\\'s worth, with Hermione sitting next to him intoning \"ignore them, ignore them, ignore them\"\\n\\nunder her breath, and he couldn\\'t see why today should be any better.\\n\\nWhen he and Hermione arrived at Snape\\'s dungeon after lunch, they found the Slytherins waiting outside, each and every one of them wearing a large badge on the front of his or her robes. For one wild moment Harry thought they were S.P.E.W. badges � then he saw that they all bore the same message, in luminous red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passage: SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY�� THE REAL HOGWARTS CHAMPION!\\n\\n\"Like them, Potter?\" said Malfoy loudly as Harry approached. \"And this isn\\'t all they do � look!\"\\n\\nHe pressed his badge into his chest, and the message upon it vanished, to be replaced by another one, which glowed green: POTTER STINKS!\\n\\nThe Slytherins howled with laughter. Each of them pressed their badges too, until the message POTTER STINKS was shining brightly all around Harry. He felt the heat rise in his face and neck.\\n\\n\"Oh very funny,\" Hermione said sarcastically to Pansy Parkinson and her gang of Slytherin girls, who were laughing harder than anyone, \"really witty.\"\\n\\nRon was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus. He wasn\\'t laughing, but he wasn\\'t sticking up for Harry either.\\n\\n\"Want one, Granger?\" said Malfoy, holding out a badge to Hermione. \"I\\'ve got loads. But don\\'t touch my hand, now. I\\'ve just washed it, you see; don\\'t want a Mudblood sliming it up.\"\\n\\nSome of the anger Harry had been feeling for days and days seemed to burst through a dam in his chest. He had reached for his wand before he\\'d thought what he was doing. People all around them scrambled out of the way, backing down the corridor.\\n\\n\"Harry!\" Hermione said warningly.\\n\\n\"Go on, then, Potter,\" Malfoy said quietly, drawing out his own wand. \"Moody\\'s not here to look after you now � do it, if you\\'ve got the guts �\"\\n\\nFor a split second, they looked into each other\\'s eyes, then, at exactly the same time, both acted.\\n\\n\"Funnunculus!\" Harry yelled.\\n\\n\"Densaugeo!\" screamed Malfoy.\\n\\nJets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and ricocheted off at angles �� Harry\\'s hit Goyle in the face, and Malfoy\\'s hit Hermione. Goyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose, where great ugly boils were springing up � Hermione, whimpering in panic, was clutching her mouth.\\n\\n\"Hermione!\"\\n\\nRon had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her; Harry turned and saw Ron dragging Hermione\\'s hand away from her face. It wasn\\'t a pretty sight.\\n\\nHermione\\'s front teeth � already larger than average � were now growing at an alarming rate; she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated, past her bottom lip, toward her chin � panic�stricken, she felt them and let out a terrified cry.\\n\\n\"And what is all this noise about?\" said a soft, deadly voice.\\n\\nSnape had arrived. The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations; Snape pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said, \"Explain.\"\\n\\n\"Potter attacked me, sir �\"\\n\\n\"We attacked each other at the same time!\" Harry shouted.\\n\\n\"� and he hit Goyle � look �\"\\n\\nSnape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi.\\n\\n\"Hospital wing, Goyle,\" Snape said calmly.\\n\\n\"Malfoy got Hermione!\" Ron said. \"Look!\"\\n\\nHe forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth � she was doing her best to hide them with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar. Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing at Hermione from behind Snape\\'s back.\\n\\nSnape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, \"I see no difference.\".\\n\\nHermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears, she turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight.\\n\\nIt was lucky, perhaps, that both Harry and Ron started shouting at Snape at the same time; lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for in the confused din, it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling him. He got the gist, however.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s see,\" he said, in his silkiest voice. \"Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley. Now get inside, or it\\'ll be a week\\'s worth of detentions.\"\\n\\nHarry\\'s ears were ringing. The injustice of it made him want to curse Snape into a thousand slimy pieces. He passed Snape, walked with Ron to the back of the dungeon, and slammed his bag down onto the table. Ron was shaking with anger too � for a moment, it felt as though everything was back to normal between them, but then Ron turned and sat down with Dean and Seamus instead, leaving Harry alone at his table. On the other side of the dungeon, Malfoy turned his back on Snape and pressed his badge, smirking. POTTER STINKS flashed once more across the room.\\n\\nHarry sat there staring at Snape as the lesson began, picturing horrific things happening to him. . . . If only he knew how to do the Cruciatus Curse. . . he\\'d have Snape flat on his back like that spider, jerking and twitching.\\n\\n\"Antidotes!\" said Snape, looking around at them all, his cold black eyes glittering unpleasantly. \"You should all have prepared your recipes now. I want you to brew\\n\\nthem carefully, and then, we will be selecting someone on whom to test one. . .\"\\n\\nSnape\\'s eyes met Harry\\'s, and Harry knew what was coming. Snape was going to poison him. Harry imagined picking up his cauldron, and sprinting to the front of the class, and bringing it down on Snape\\'s greasy head � And then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on Harry\\'s thoughts.\\n\\nIt was Colin Creevey; he edged into the room, beaming at Harry, and walked up to Snape\\'s desk at the front of the room.\\n\\n\"Yes?\" said Snape curtly.\\n\\n\"Please, sir, I\\'m supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs.\" Snape stared down his hooked nose at Colin, whose smile faded from his eager face.\\n\\n\"Potter has another hour of Potions to complete,\" said Snape coldly. \"He will come upstairs when this class is finished.\"\\n\\nColin went pink.\\n\\n\"Sir � sir, Mr. Bagman wants him,\" he said nervously. \"All the champions have got to go, I think they want to take photographs. . .\"\\n\\nHarry would have given anything he owned to have stopped Colin saying those last few words. He chanced half a glance at Ron, but Ron was staring determinedly at the ceiling.\\n\\n\"Very well, very well,\" Snape snapped. \"Potter, leave your things here, I want you back down here later to test your antidote.\"\\n\\n\"Please, sir � he\\'s got to take his things with him,\" squeaked Cohn. \"All the champions...\"\\n\\n\"Very well!\" said Snape. \"Potter � take your bag and get out of my sight!\"\\n\\nHarry swung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and headed for the door. As he walked through the Slytherin desks, POTTER STINKS flashed at him from every direction.\\n\\n\"It\\'s amazing, isn\\'t it, Harry?\" said Colin, starting to speak the moment Harry had closed the dungeon door behind him. \"Isn\\'t it, though? You being champion?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, really amazing,\" said Harry heavily as they set off toward the steps into the entrance hall. \"What do they want photos for, Colin?\"\\n\\n\"The Daily Prophet, I think!\"\\n\\n\"Great,\" said Harry dully. \"Exactly what I need. More publicity.\"\\n\\n\"Good luck!\" said Colin when they had reached the right room. Harry knocked on the door and entered.\\n\\nHe was in a fairly small classroom; most of the desks had been pushed away to the back of the room, leaving a large space in the middle; three of them, however, had been placed end�to�end in front of the blackboard and covered with a long length of velvet. Five chairs had been set behind the velvet�covered desks, and Ludo Bagman was sitting in one of them, talking to a witch Harry had never seen before, who was wearing magenta robes.\\n\\nViktor Krum was standing moodily in a corner as usual and not talking to anybody. Cedric and Fheur were in conversation. Fheur looked a good deal happier than Harry had seen her so far; she kept throwing back her head so that her long silvery hair caught the light. A paunchy man, holding a large black camera that was smoking slightly, was watching Fleur out of the corner of his eye.\\n\\nBagman suddenly spotted Harry, got up quickly, and bounded forward.\\n\\n\"Ah, here he is! Champion number four! In you come, Harry, in you come.. .\\n\\nnothing to worry about, it\\'s just the wand weighing ceremony, the rest of the judges will be here in a moment �\"\\n\\n\"Wand weighing?\" Harry repeated nervously.\\n\\n\"We have to check that your wands are fully functional, no problems, you know, as they\\'re your most important tools in the tasks ahead,\" said Bagman. \"The expert\\'s upstairs now with Dumbledore. And then there\\'s going to be a little photo shoot. This is Rita Skeeter,\" he added, gesturing toward the witch in magenta robes. \"She\\'s doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily Prophet. .. .\"\\n\\n\"Maybe not that small, Ludo,\" said Rita Skeeter, her eyes on Harry.\\n\\nHer hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that contrasted oddly with her heavy�jawed face. She wore jeweled spectacles. The thick fingers clutching her crocodile�skin handbag ended in two�inch nails, painted crimson.\\n\\n\"I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start?\" she said to Bagman, but still gazing fixedly at Harry. \"The youngest champion, you know. . .\\n\\nto add a bit of color?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly!\" cried Bagman. \"That is � if Harry has no objection?\"\\n\\n\"Er �\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Lovely,\" said Rita Skeeter, and in a second, her scarlet�taloned fingers had Harry\\'s upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip, and she was steering him out of the room again and opening a nearby door.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t want to be in there with all that noise,\" she said. \"Let\\'s see . . . ah, yes, this is nice and cozy.\"\\n\\nIt was a broom cupboard. Harry stared at her.\\n\\n\"Come along, dear � that\\'s right � lovely,\" said Rita Skeeter again, perching herself precariously upon an upturned bucket, pushing Harry down onto a cardboard box, and closing the door, throwing them into darkness. \"Let\\'s see now. .\"\\n\\nShe unsnapped her crocodile�skin handbag and pulled out a handful of candles, which she lit with a wave of her wand and magicked into midair, so that they could see what they were doing.\\n\\n\"You won\\'t mind, Harry, if I use a Quick�Quotes Quill? It leaves me free to talk to you normally. ..\"\\n\\n\"A what?\" said Harry.\\n\\nRita Skeeter\\'s smile widened. Harry counted three gold teeth. She reached again into her crocodile bag and drew out a long acid�green quill and a roll of parchment, which she stretched out between them on a crate of Mrs. Skower\\'s All� Purpose Magical Mess Remover. She put the tip of the green quill into her mouth, sucked it for a moment with apparent relish, then placed it upright on the parchment, where it stood balanced on its point, quivering slightly.\\n\\n\"Testing. . . my name is Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter.\"\\n\\nHarry hooked down quickly at the quill. The moment Rita Skeeter had spoken, the green quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchment: Attractive blonde Rita Skeeter, forty�three, who\\'s savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations � \"Lovely,\" said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped the top piece of parchment off, crumpled it up, and stuffed it into her handbag. Now she leaned toward Harry and said, \"So, Harry... what made you decide to enter the Triwizard Tournament?\"\\n\\n\"Er �\" said Harry again, but he was distracted by the quill. Even though he wasn\\'t speaking, it was dashing across the parchment, and in its wake he could make out a fresh sentence: An ugly scar, souvenier of a tragic past, disfigures the otherwise charming face of Harry Potter, whose eyes �� \"Ignore the quill, Harry,\" said Rita Skeeter firmly. Reluctantly Harry looked up at her instead. \"Now �� why did you decide to enter the tournament, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t,\" said Harry. \"I don\\'t know how my name got into the Goblet of Fire. I didn\\'t put it in there.\"\\n\\nRita Skeeter raised one heavily penciled eyebrow.\\n\\n\"Come now, Harry, there\\'s no need to be scared of getting into trouble. We all know you shouldn\\'t really have entered at all. But don\\'t worry about that. Our readers hove a rebel.\"\\n\\n\"But I didn\\'t enter,\" Harry repeated. \"I don\\'t know who �\"\\n\\n\"How do you feel about the tasks ahead?\" said Rita Skeeter. \"Excited? Nervous?\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t really thought. . . yeah, nervous, I suppose,\" said Harry. His insides squirmed uncomfortably as he spoke.\\n\\n\"Champions have died in the past, haven\\'t they?\" said Rita Skeeter briskly. \"Have you thought about that at all?\"\\n\\n\"Well. . . they say it\\'s going to be a lot safer this year,\" said Harry.\\n\\nThe quill whizzed across the parchment between them, back and forward as though it were skating.\\n\\n\"Of course, you\\'ve looked death in the face before, haven\\'t you?\" said Rita Skeeter, watching him closely. \"How would you say that\\'s affected you?\"\\n\\n\"Er,\" said Harry, yet again.\\n\\n\"Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove yourself? To live up to your name? Do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because � \"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t enter,\" said Harry, starting to feel irritated.\\n\\n\"Can you remember your parents at all?\" said Rita Skeeter, talking over him.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"How do you think they\\'d feel if they knew you were competing in the Triwizard Tournament? Proud? Worried? Angry?\"\\n\\nHarry was feeling really annoyed now. How on earth was he to know how his parents would feel if they were alive? He could feel Rita Skeeter watching him very intently. Frowning, he avoided her gaze and hooked down at words the quill had just written: Tears fill those startlingly green eyes as our conversation turns to the parents he can barely remember.\\n\\n\"I have NOT got tears in my eyes!\" said Harry loudly.\\n\\nBefore Rita Skeeter could say a word, the door of the broom cupboard was pulled open. Harry looked around, blinking in the bright light. Albus Dumbledore stood there, looking down at both of them, squashed into the cupboard.\\n\\n\"Dumbledore!\" cried Rita Skeeter, with every appearance of delight � but Harry noticed that her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from the box of Magical Mess Remover, and Rita\\'s clawed fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her crocodile�skin bag. \"How are you?\" she said, standing up and holding\\n\\nout one of her large, mannish hands to Dumbledore. \"I hope you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards\\' Conference?\"\\n\\n\"Enchantingly nasty,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. \"I particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat.\"\\n\\nRita Skeeter didn\\'t look remotely abashed.\\n\\n\"I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old�fashioned, Dumbhedore, and that many wizards in the street �\"\\n\\n\"I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness, Rita,\" said Dumbledore, with a courteous bow and a smile, \"but I\\'m afraid we will have to discuss the matter later. The Weighing of the Wands is about to start, and it cannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard.\"\\n\\nVery glad to get away from Rita Skeeter, Harry hurried back into the room. The other champions were now sitting in chairs near the door, and he sat down quickly next to Cedric, hooking up at the velvet�covered table, where four of the five judges were now sitting � Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Mr. Crouch, and Ludo Bagman. Rita Skeeter settled herself down in a corner; Harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again, spread it on her knee, suck the end of the Quick�Quotes Quill, and place it once more on the parchment.\\n\\n\"May I introduce Mr. Ollivander?\" said Dumbledore, taking his place at the judges\\' table and talking to the champions. \"He will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament.\"\\n\\nHarry hooked around, and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with large, pale eyes standing quietly by the window. Harry had met Mr. Ollivander before � he was the wand�maker from whom Harry had bought his own wand over three years ago in Diagon Alley.\\n\\n\"Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first, please?\" said Mr. Ollivander, stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room.\\n\\nFleur Delacour swept over to Mr. Olhivander and handed him her wand.\\n\\n\"Hmm...\" he said.\\n\\nHe twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a number of pink and gold sparks. Then he held it chose to his eyes and examined it carefully.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he said quietly, \"nine and a half inches. . . inflexible.. rosewood.. . and containing. . . dear me. . .\"\\n\\n\"An \\'air from ze \\'ead of a veela,\" said Fleur. \"One of my grandmuzzer\\'s.\"\\n\\nSo Fleur was part veela, thought Harry, making a mental note to tell Ron. . . then\\n\\nhe remembered that Ron wasn\\'t speaking to him.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Ollivander, \"yes, I\\'ve never used veela hair myself, of course. I find it makes for rather temperamental wands...however, to each his own, and if this suits you..\"\\n\\nMr. Ollivander ran his fingers along the wand, apparently checking for scratches or bumps; then he muttered, \"Orchideous!\" and a bunch of flowers burst from the wand tip.\\n\\n\"Very well, very well, it\\'s in fine working order,\" said Mr. Ollivander, scooping up the flowers and handing them to Fleur with her wand. \"Mr. Diggory, you next.\"\\n\\nFleur glided back to her seat, smiling at Cedric as he passed her.\\n\\n\"Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn\\'t it?\" said Mr. Ollivander, with much more enthusiasm, as Cedric handed over his wand. \"Yes, I remember it well. Containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn. . . must have been seventeen hands; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked his tail. Twelve and a quarter inches. . . ash. . . pleasantly springy. It\\'s in fine condition...You treat it regularly?\"\\n\\n\"Polished it last night,\" said Cedric, grinning.\\n\\nHarry hooked down at his own wand. He could see finger marks all over it. He gathered a fistful of robe from his knee and tried to rub it clean surreptitiously.\\n\\nSeveral gold sparks shot out of the end of it. Fleur Delacour gave him a very patronizing look, and he desisted.\\n\\nMr. Ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the room from the tip of Cedric\\'s wand, pronounced himself satisfied, and then said, \"Mr. Krum, if you please.\"\\n\\nViktor Krum got up and slouched, round�shouldered and duck�footed, toward Mr.\\n\\nOllivander. He thrust out his wand and stood scowling, with his hands in the pockets of his robes.\\n\\n\"Hmm,\" said Mr. Olhivander, \"this is a Gregorovitch creation, unless I\\'m much mistaken? A fine wand�maker, though the styling is never quite what I. . .\\n\\nhowever. .\"\\n\\nHe lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning it over and over before his eyes.\\n\\n\"Yes.. . hornbeam and dragon heartstring?\" he shot at Krum, who nodded. \"Rather thicker than one usually sees. . . quite rigid. . . ten and a quarter inches. . . Avis!\"\\n\\nThe hornbeam wand let off a blast hike a gun, and a number of small, twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the watery sunlight.\\n\\n\"Good,\" said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his wand. \"Which leaves. . . Mr.\\n\\nPotter.\"\\n\\nHarry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr. Ollivander. He handed over his wand.\\n\\n\"Aaaah, yes,\" said Mr. Ohlivander, his pale eyes suddenly gleaming. \"Yes, yes, yes. How well I remember.\"\\n\\nHarry could remember too. He could remember it as though it had happened yesterday....\\n\\nFour summers ago, on his eleventh birthday, he had entered Mr. Ollivander\\'s shop with Hagrid to buy a wand. Mr. Ollivander had taken his measurements and then started handing him wands to try. Harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until at last he had found the one that suited him � this one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix. Mr. Ollivander had been very surprised that Harry had been so compatible with this wand. \"Curious,\" he had said, \"curious,\" and not until Harry asked what was curious had Mr. Olhivander explained that the phoenix feather in Harry\\'s wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of Lord Voldemort\\'s.\\n\\nHarry had never shared this piece of information with anybody. He was very fond of his wand, and as far as he was concerned its relation to Voldemort\\'s wand was something it couldn\\'t help � rather as he couldn\\'t help being related to Aunt Petunia. However, he really hoped that Mr. Ollivander wasn\\'t about to tell the room about it. He had a funny feeling Rita Skeeter\\'s Quick�Quotes Quill might just explode with excitement if he did.\\n\\nMr. Ollivander spent much longer examining Harry\\'s wand than anyone else\\'s.\\n\\nEventually, however, he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it back to Harry, announcing that it was still in perfect condition.\\n\\n\"Thank you all,\" said Dumbledore, standing up at the judges\\' table. \"You may go back to your lessons now � or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to end �\"\\n\\nFeeling that at last something had gone right today, Harry got up to leave, but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat.\\n\\n\"Photos, Dumbledore, photos!\" cried Bagman excitedly. \"All the judges and champions, what do you think, Rita?\"\\n\\n\"Er � yes, let\\'s do those first,\" said Rita Skeeter, whose eyes were upon Harry again. \"And then perhaps some individual shots.\"\\n\\nThe photographs took a long time. Madame Maxime cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood, and the photographer couldn\\'t stand far enough back\\n\\nto get her into the frame; eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood around her. Karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl; Krum, whom Harry would have thought would have been used to this sort of thing, skulked, half�hidden, at the back of the group. The photographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging Harry into greater prominence. Then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions. At last, they were free to go.\\n\\nHarry went down to dinner. Hermione wasn\\'t there � he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed. He ate alone at the end of the table, then returned to Gryffindor Tower, thinking of all the extra work on Summoning Charms that he had to do. Up in the dormitory, he came across Ron.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve had an owl,\" said Ron brusquely the moment he walked in. He was pointing at Harry\\'s pillow. The school barn owl was waiting for him there.\\n\\n\"Oh � right,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"And we\\'ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape\\'s dungeon,\" said Ron.\\n\\nHe then walked straight out of the room, not looking at Harry. For a moment, Harry considered going after him � he wasn\\'t sure whether he wanted to talk to him or hit him, both seemed quite appealing � but the lure of Sirius\\'s answer was too strong. Harry strode over to the barn owl, took the letter off its leg, and unrolled it.\\n\\nHarry � I can\\'t say everything I would like to in a letter, it\\'s too risky in case the owl is intercepted � we need to talk face�to�face. Can you ensure that you are alone by the fire in Gryffindor Tower at one o\\'clock in the morning on the 22nd ofNovember!\\n\\nI know better than anyone that you can look after yourself and while you\\'re around Dumbledore and Moody I don\\'t think anyone will be able to hurt you. However, someone seems to be having a good try. Entering you in that tournament would have been very risky, especially right under Dumbkdore\\'s nose.\\n\\nBe on the watch, Harry. I still want to hear about anything unusual. Let me know about the 22nd ofNovember as quickly as you can.\\n\\nSirius\\n\\nCHAPTER NINETEEN � THE HUNGARIAN HORNTAIL\\n\\nThe prospect of talking face�to�face with Sirius was all that sustained Harry over the next fortnight, the only bright spot on a horizon that had never looked darker.\\n\\nThe shock of finding himself school champion had worn off slightly now, and the fear of what was facing him had started to sink in. The first task was drawing steadily nearer; he felt as though it were crouching ahead of him hike some horrific monster, barring his path. He had never suffered nerves like these; they were way beyond anything he had experienced before a Quidditch match, not even his last one against Slytherin, which had decided who would win the Quidditch Cup. Harry was finding it hard to think about the future at all; he felt as though his whole life had been heading up to, and would finish with, the first task.\\n\\nAdmittedly, he didn\\'t see how Sirius was going to make him feel any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people, but the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment. Harry wrote back to Sirius saying that he would be beside the common room fire at the time Sirius had suggested; and he and Hermione spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the common room on the night in question. If the worst came to the worst, they were going to drop a bag of Dungbombs, but they hoped they wouldn\\'t have to resort to that � Filch would skin them alive.\\n\\nIn the meantime, life became even worse for Harry within the confines of the castle, for Rita Skeeter had published her piece about the Triwizard Tournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of Harry. Much of the front page had been given over to a picture of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two, six, and seven) had been all about Harry, the names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions (misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of the article, and Cedric hadn\\'t been mentioned at all.\\n\\nThe article had appeared ten days ago, and Harry still got a sick, burning feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought about it. Rita Skeeter had reported him saying an awful lot of things that he couldn\\'t remember ever saying in his life, let alone in that broom cupboard.\\n\\nI suppose I get my strength from my parents. I know they\\'d be very proud of me if they could see me now. . . . Yes, sometimes at night I still cry about them, I\\'m not ashamed to admit it. . . . I know nothing will hurt me during the tournament, because they\\'re watching over me. . .\\n\\nBut Rita Skeeter had gone even further than transforming his \"er\\'s\" into long, sickly sentences: She had interviewed other people about him too.\\n\\nHarry has at last found love at Hogwarts. His close friend, Colin Creevey, says that Harry is rarely seen out of the company of one Hermione Granger, a stunningly pretty Muggle�born girl who, like Harry, is one of the top students in the school.\\n\\nFrom the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to endure people �� Slytherins, mainly �� quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering comments.\\n\\n\"Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration?\"\\n\\n\"Since when have you been one of the top students in the school, Potter? Or is this a school you and Longbottom have set up together?\"\\n\\n\"Hey � Harry!\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, that\\'s right!\" Harry found himself shouting as he wheeled around in the corridor, having had just about enough. \"I\\'ve just been crying my eyes out over my dead mum, and I\\'m just off to do a bit more. . .\\n\\n\"No � it was just � you dropped your quill.\"\\n\\nIt was Cho. Harry felt the color rising in his face.\\n\\n\"Oh � right � sorry,\" he muttered, taking the quill back.\\n\\n\"Er. . . good luck on Tuesday,\" she said. \"I really hope you do well.\"\\n\\nWhich left Harry feeling extremely stupid.\\n\\nHermione had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too, but she hadn\\'t yet started yelling at innocent bystanders; in fact, Harry was full of admiration for the way she was handling the situation.\\n\\n\"Stunningly pretty? Her?\" Pansy Parkinson had shrieked the first time she had come face�to�face with Hermione after Rita\\'s article had appeared. \"What was she judging against � a chipmunk?\"\\n\\n\"Ignore it,\" Hermione said in a dignified voice, holding her head in the air and stalking past the sniggering Slytherin girls as though she couldn\\'t hear them. \"Just ignore it, Harry.\"\\n\\nBut Harry couldn\\'t ignore it. Ron hadn\\'t spoken to him at all since he had told him about Snape\\'s detentions. Harry had half hoped they would make things up during the two hours they were forced to pickle rats\\' brains in Snape\\'s dungeon, but that had been the day Rita\\'s article had appeared, which seemed to have confirmed Ron\\'s belief that Harry was really enjoying all the attention.\\n\\nHermione was furious with the pair of them; she went from one to the other, trying to force them to talk to each other, but Harry was adamant: He would talk to Ron again only if Ron admitted that Harry hadn\\'t put his name in the Goblet of Fire and\\n\\napologized for calling him a liar.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t start this,\" Harry said stubbornly. \"It\\'s his problem.\"\\n\\n\"You miss him!\" Hermione said impatiently. \"And I know he misses you �\"\\n\\n\"Miss him?\" said Harry. \"I don\\'t miss him. . .\\n\\nBut this was a downright lie. Harry liked Hermione very much, but she just wasn\\'t the same as Ron. There was much hess laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when Hermione was your best friend. Harry still hadn\\'t mastered Summoning Charms, he seemed to have developed something of a block about them, and Hermione insisted that learning the theory would help. They consequently spent a lot of time poring over books during their lunchtimes.\\n\\nViktor Krum was in the library an awful lot too, and Harry wondered what he was up to. Was he studying, or was he looking for things to help him through the first task? Hermione often complained about Krum being there � not that he ever bothered them � but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy on him from behind bookshelves, and Hermione found the noise distracting.\\n\\n\"He\\'s not even good�looking!\" she muttered angrily, glaring at Krum\\'s sharp profile. \"They only like him because he\\'s famous! They wouldn\\'t look twice at him if he couldn\\'t do that WonkyFaint thing �\"\\n\\n\"Wronski Feint,\" said Harry, through gritted teeth. Quite apart from liking to get Quidditch terms correct, it caused him another pang to imagine Ron\\'s expression if he could have heard Hermione talking about Wonky�Faints.\\n\\nIt is a strange thing, but when you are dreading something, and would give anything to slow down time, it has a disobliging habit of speeding up. The days until the first task seemed to slip by as though someone had fixed the clocks to work at double speed. Harry\\'s feeling of barely controlled panic was with him wherever he went, as everpresent as the snide comments about the Daily Prophet article.\\n\\nOn the Saturday before the first task, all students in the third year and above were permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade. Hermione told Harry that it would do him good to get away from the castle for a bit, and Harry didn\\'t need much persuasion.\\n\\n\"What about Ron, though?\" he said. \"Don\\'t you want to go with him?\"\\n\\n\"Oh. . . well.. .\" Hermione went slightly pink. \"I thought we might meet up with him in the Three Broomsticks. . . .\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry flatly.\\n\\n\"Oh Harry, this is so stupid �\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll come, but I\\'m not meeting Ron, and I\\'m wearing my Invisibility Cloak.\"\\n\\n\"Oh all right then. . .\" Hermione snapped, \"but I hate talking to you in that cloak, I never know if I\\'m looking at you or not.\"\\n\\nSo Harry put on his Invisibility Cloak in the dormitory, went back downstairs, and together he and Hermione set off for Hogsmeade.\\n\\nHarry felt wonderfully free under the cloak; he watched other students walking past them as they entered the village, most of them sporting Support Cedric Diggory! badges, but no horrible remarks came his way for a change, and nobody was quoting that stupid article.\\n\\n\"People keep looking at me now,\" said Hermione grumpily as they came out of Honeydukes Sweetshop later, eating large cream�filled chocolates. \"They think I\\'m talking to myself.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t move your lips so much then.\"\\n\\n\"Come on, please just take off your cloak for a bit, no one\\'s going to bother you here.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yeah?\" said Harry. \"Look behind you.\"\\n\\nRita Skeeter and her photographer friend had just emerged from the Three Broomsticks pub. Talking in low voices, they passed right by Hermione without hooking at her. Harry backed into the wall of Honeydukes to stop Rita Skeeter from hitting him with her crocodile�skin handbag. When they were gone, Harry said, \"She\\'s staying in the village. I bet she\\'s coming to watch the first task.\"\\n\\nAs he said it, his stomach flooded with a wave of molten panic. He didn\\'t mention this; he and Hermione hadn\\'t discussed what was coming in the first task much; he had the feeling she didn\\'t want to think about it.\\n\\n\"She\\'s gone,\" said Hermione, looking right through Harry toward the end of the street. \"Why don\\'t we go and have a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks, it\\'s a bit cold, isn\\'t it? You don\\'t have to talk to Ron!\" she added irritably, correctly interpreting his silence.\\n\\nThe Three Broomsticks was packed, mainly with Hogwarts students enjoying their free afternoon, but also with a variety of magical people Harry rarely saw anywhere else. Harry supposed that as Hogsmeade was the only all�wizard village in Britain, it was a bit of a haven for creatures like hags, who were not as adept as wizards at disguising themselves.\\n\\nIt was very hard to move through crowds in the Invisibility Cloak, in case you accidentally trod on someone, which tended to lead to awkward questions. Harry edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner while Hermione went to buy drinks. On his way through the pub, Harry spotted Ron, who was sitting with Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Resisting the urge to give Ron a good hard poke in the\\n\\nback of the head, he finally reached the table and sat down at it.\\n\\nHermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butterbeer under his cloak.\\n\\n\"I look like such an idiot, sitting here on my own,\" she muttered. \"Lucky I brought something to do.\"\\n\\nAnd she pulled out a notebook in which she had been keeping a record of S.P.E.W. members. Harry saw his and Ron\\'s names at the top of the very short list.\\n\\nIt seemed a long time ago that they had sat making up those predictions together, and Hermione had turned up and appointed them secretary and treasurer.\\n\\n\"You know, maybe I should try and get some of the villagers involved in S.P.E.W.,\" Hermione said thoughtfully, looking around the pub.\\n\\n\"Yeah, right,\" said Harry. He took a swig of butterbeer under his cloak.\\n\\n\"Hermione, when are you going to give up on this spew stuff?\"\\n\\n\"When house�elves have decent wages and working conditions!\" she hissed back.\\n\\n\"You know, I\\'m starting to think it\\'s time for more direct action. I wonder how you get into the school kitchens?\"\\n\\n\"No idea, ask Fred and George,\" said Harry.\\n\\nHermione lapsed into thoughtful silence, while Harry drank his butterbeer, watching the people in the pub. All of them looked cheerful and relaxed. Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbot were swapping Chocolate Frog cards at a nearby table; both of them sporting Support Cedric Diggory! badges on their cloaks.\\n\\nRight over by the door he saw Cho and a large group of her Ravenclaw friends.\\n\\nShe wasn\\'t wearing a Cedric badge though. . . . This cheered up Harry very slightly.\\n\\nWhat wouldn\\'t he have given to be one of these peophe, sitting around laughing and talking, with nothing to worry about but homework? He imagined how it would have felt to be here if his name hadn\\'t come out of the Goblet of Fire. He wouldn\\'t be wearing the Invisibility Cloak, for one thing. Ron would be sitting with him. The three of them would probably be happily imagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing on Tuesday. He\\'d have been really hooking forward to it, watching them do whatever it was...cheering on Cedric with everyone else, safe in a seat at the back of the stands...\\n\\nHe wondered how the other champions were feeling. Every time he had seen Cedric lately, he had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but excited. Harry glimpsed Fleur Delacour from time to time in the corridors; she looked exactly as she always did, haughty and unruffled. And Krum just sat in the library, poring over books.\\n\\nHarry thought of Sirius, and the tight, tense knot in his chest seemed to ease slightly. He would be speaking to him in just over twelve hours, for tonight was\\n\\nthe night they were meeting at the common room fire � assuming nothing went wrong, as everything else had done lately...\\n\\n\"Look, it\\'s Hagrid!\" said Hermione.\\n\\nThe back of Hagrid\\'s enormous shaggy head � he had mercifully abandoned his bunches � emerged over the crowd. Harry wondered why he hadn\\'t spotted him at once, as Hagrid was so large, but standing up carefully, he saw that Hagrid had been leaning low, talking to Professor Moody. Hagrid had his usual enormous tankard in front of him, but Moody was drinking from his hip flask. Madam Rosmerta, the pretty landlady, didn\\'t seem to think much of this; she was looking askance at Moody as she collected glasses from tables around them. Perhaps she thought it was an insult to her mulled mead, but Harry knew better. Moody had told them all during their last Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson that he preferred to prepare his own food and drink at all times, as it was so easy for Dark wizards to poison an unattended cup.\\n\\nAs Harry watched, he saw Hagrid and Moody get up to leave. He waved, then remembered that Hagrid couldn\\'t see him. Moody, however, paused, his magical eye on the corner where Harry was standing. He tapped Hagrid in the small of the back (being unable to reach his shoulder), muttered something to him, and then the pair of them made their way back across the pub toward Harry and Hermione\\'s table.\\n\\n\"All right, Hermione?\" said Hagrid loudly.\\n\\n\"Hello,\" said Hermione, smiling back.\\n\\nMoody limped around the table and bent down; Harry thought he was reading the S.P.E.W. notebook, until he muttered, \"Nice cloak, Potter.\"\\n\\nHarry stared at him in amazement. The large chunk missing from Moody\\'s nose was particularly obvious at a few inches\\' distance. Moody grinned.\\n\\n\"Can your eye � I mean, can you � ?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, it can see through Invisibility Cloaks,\" Moody said quietly. \"And it\\'s come in useful at times, I can tell you.\"\\n\\nHagrid was beaming down at Harry too. Harry knew Hagrid couldn\\'t see him, but Moody had obviously told Hagrid he was there. Hagrid now bent down on the pretext of reading the S.P.E.W. notebook as well, and said in a whisper so low that only Harry could hear it, \"Harry, meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin. Wear that cloak.\"\\n\\nStraightening up, Hagrid said loudly, \"Nice ter see yeh, Hermione,\" winked, and departed. Moody followed him.\\n\\n\"Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight?\" Harry said, very surprised.\\n\\n\"Does he?\" said Hermione, looking startled. \"I wonder what he\\'s up to? I don\\'t know whether you should go, Harry. . . .\" She looked nervously around and hissed, \"It might make you late for Sirius.\"\\n\\nIt was true that going down to Hagrid\\'s at midnight would mean cutting his meeting with Sirius very fine indeed; Hermione suggested sending Hedwig down to Hagrid\\'s to tell him he couldn\\'t go � always assuming she would consent to take the note, of course � Harry, however, thought it better just to be quick at whatever Hagrid wanted him for. He was very curious to know what this might be; Hagrid had never asked Harry to visit him so late at night.\\n\\nAt half past eleven that evening, Harry, who had pretended to go up to bed early, pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs through the common room. Quite a few people were still in there. The Creevey brothers had managed to get hold of a stack of Support Cedric Diggory! badges and were trying to bewitch them to make them say Support Harry Potter! instead. So far, however, all they had managed to do was get the badges stuck on POTTER STINKS. Harry crept past them to the portrait hole and waited for a minute or so, keeping an eye on his watch. Then Hermione opened the Fat Lady for him from outside as they had planned. He slipped past her with a whispered \"Thanks!\" and set off through the castle.\\n\\nThe grounds were very dark. Harry walked down the lawn toward the lights shining in Hagrid\\'s cabin. The inside of the enormous Beauxbatons carriage was also lit up; Harry could hear Madame Maxime talking inside it as he knocked on Hagrid\\'s front door.\\n\\n\"You there, Harry?\" Hagrid whispered, opening the door and looking around.\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, slipping inside the cabin and pulling the cloak down off his head. \"What\\'s up?\"\\n\\n\"Got summat ter show yeh,\" said Hagrid.\\n\\nThere was an air of enormous excitement about Hagrid. He was wearing a flower that resembled an oversized artichoke in his buttonhole. It looked as though he had abandoned the use of axle grease, but he had certainly attempted to comb his hair � Harry could see the comb\\'s broken teeth tangled in it.\\n\\n\"What\\'re you showing me?\" Harry said warily, wondering if the skrewts had laid eggs, or Hagrid had managed to buy another giant three�headed dog off a stranger in a pub.\\n\\n\"Come with me, keep quiet, an\\' keep yerself covered with that cloak,\" said Hagrid.\\n\\n\"We won\\' take Fang, he won\\' like it. . .\\n\\n\"Listen, Hagrid, I can\\'t stay long. . . . I\\'ve got to be back up at the castle by one o\\'clock �\"\\n\\nBut Hagrid wasn\\'t listening; he was opening the cabin door and striding off into the night. Harry hurried to follow and found, to his great surprise, that Hagrid was leading him to the Beauxbatons carriage.\\n\\n\"Hagrid, what � ?\"\\n\\n\"Shhh!\" said Hagrid, and he knocked three times on the door bearing the crossed golden wands.\\n\\nMadame Maxime opened it. She was wearing a silk shawl wrapped around her massive shoulders. She smiled when she saw Hagrid.\\n\\n\"Ah, \\'Agrid . . . it is time?\"\\n\\n\"Bong�sewer,\" said Hagrid, beaming at her, and holding out a hand to help her down the golden steps.\\n\\nMadame Maxime closed the door behind her, Hagrid offered her his arm, and they set off around the edge of the paddock containing Madame Maxime\\'s giant winged horses, with Harry, totally bewildered, running to keep up with them. Had Hagrid wanted to show him Madame Maxime? He could see her any old time he wanted..\\n\\n. she wasn\\'t exactly hard to miss....\\n\\nBut it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the same treat as Harry, because after a while she said playfully, \"Wair is it you are taking me, \\'Agrid?\"\\n\\n\"Yeh\\'ll enjoy this,\" said Hagrid gruffly, \"worth seein\\', trust me. On\\'y � don\\' go tellin\\' anyone I showed yeh, right? Yeh\\'re not s\\'posed ter know.\"\\n\\n\"Of course not,\" said Madame Maxime, fluttering her long black eyelashes.\\n\\nAnd still they walked, Harry getting more and more irritated as he jogged along in their wake, checking his watch every now and then. Hagrid had some harebrained scheme in hand, which might make him miss Sirius. If they didn\\'t get there soon, he was going to turn around, go straight back to the castle, and leave Hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with Madame Maxime.\\n\\nBut then � when they had walked so far around the perimeter of the forest that the castle and the lake were out of sight � Harry heard something. Men were shouting up ahead. . . then came a deafening, earsplitting roar. . .\\n\\nHagrid led Madame Maxime around a clump of trees and came to a halt. Harry hurried up alongside them � for a split second, he thought he was seeing bonfires, and men darting around them � and then his mouth fell open.\\n\\nDragons.\\n\\nFour fully grown, enormous, vicious�looking dragons were rearing onto their hind legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks of wood, roaring and snorting � torrents of fire were shooting into the dark sky from their open, fanged mouths,\\n\\nfifty feet above the ground on their outstretched necks. There was a silvery�blue one with long, pointed horns, snapping and snarling at the wizards on the ground; a smooth�scaled green one, which was writhing and stamping with all its might; a red one with an odd fringe of fine gold spikes around its face, which was shooting mushroom�shaped fire clouds into the air; and a gigantic black one, more lizard� hike than the others, which was nearest to them.\\n\\nAt least thirty wizards, seven or eight to each dragon, were attempting to control them, pulling on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around their necks and legs. Mesmerized, Harry looked up, high above him, and saw the eyes of the black dragon, with vertical pupils like a cat\\'s, bulging with either fear or rage, he couldn\\'t tell which. . . . It was making a horrible noise, a yowling, screeching scream.\\n\\n\"Keep back there, Hagrid!\" yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the chain he was holding. \"They can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet, you know! I\\'ve seen this Horntail do forty!\"\\n\\n\"Is\\'n\\' it beautiful?\" said Hagrid softly.\\n\\n\"It\\'s no good!\" yelled another wizard. \"Stunning Spells, on the count of three!\"\\n\\nHarry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wand.\\n\\n\"Stupefy!\" they shouted in unison, and the Stunning Spells shot into the darkness like fiery rockets, bursting in showers of stars on the dragons\\' scaly hides � Harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back legs; its jaws stretched wide in a silent howl; its nostrils were suddenly devoid of flame, though still smoking � then, very slowly, it fell. Several tons of sinewy, scaly� black dragon hit the ground with a thud that Harry could have sworn made the trees behind him quake.\\n\\nThe dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward to their fallen charges, each of which was the size of a small hill. They hurried to tighten the chains and fasten them securely to iron pegs, which they forced deep into the ground with their wands.\\n\\n\"Wan\\' a closer look?\" Hagrid asked Madame Maxime excitedly. The pair of them moved right up to the fence, and Harry followed. The wizard who had warned Hagrid not to come any closer turned, and Harry realized who it was: Charlie Weasley.\\n\\n\"All right, Hagrid?\" he panted, coming over to talk. \"They should be okay now � we put them out with a Sleeping Draft on the way here, thought it might be better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet � but, like you saw, they weren\\'t happy, not happy at all �\"\\n\\n\"What breeds you got here, Charlie?\" said Hagrid, gazing at the closest dragon, the\\n\\nblack one, with something chose to reverence. Its eyes were still just open. Harry could see a strip of gleaming yellow beneath its wrinkled black eyelid.\\n\\n\"This is a Hungarian Horntail,\" said Charlie. \"There\\'s a Common Welsh Green over there, the smaller one �� a Swedish Short�Snout, that blue�gray �� and a Chinese Fireball, that\\'s the red.\"\\n\\nCharlie looked around; Madame Maxime was strolling away around the edge of the enclosure, gazing at the stunned dragons.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know you were bringing her, Hagrid,\" Charlie said, frowning. \"The champions aren\\'t supposed to know what\\'s coming � she\\'s bound to tell her student, isn\\'t she?\"\\n\\n\"Jus\\' thought she\\'d like ter see \\'em,\" shrugged Hagrid, still gazing, enraptured, at the dragons.\\n\\n\"Really romantic date, Hagrid,\" said Charlie, shaking his head.\\n\\n\"Four. . .\" said Hagrid, \"so it\\'s one fer each o\\' the champions, is it? What\\'ve they gotta do � fight \\'em?\"\\n\\n\"Just get past them, I think,\" said Charlie. \"We\\'ll be on hand if it gets nasty, Extinguishing Spells at the ready. They wanted nesting mothers, I don\\'t know why. . . but I tell you this, I don\\'t envy the one who gets the Horntail. Vicious thing. Its back end\\'s as dangerous as its front, look.\"\\n\\nCharlie pointed toward the Horntail\\'s tail, and Harry saw long, bronze�colored spikes protruding along it every few inches.\\n\\nFive of Charlie\\'s fellow keepers staggered up to the Horntail at that moment, carrying a clutch of huge granite�gray eggs between them in a blanket. They placed them carefully at the Horntail\\'s side. Hagrid let out a moan of longing.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got them counted, Hagrid,\" said Charlie sternly. Then he said, \"How\\'s Harry?\"\\n\\n\"Fine,\" said Hagrid. He was still gazing at the eggs.\\n\\n\"Just hope he\\'s still fine after he\\'s faced this lot,\" said Charlie grimly, looking out over the dragons\\' enclosure. \"I didn\\'t dare tell Mum what he\\'s got to do for the first task; she\\'s already having kittens about him. . . .\" Charlie imitated his mother\\'s anxious voice. \"How could they let him enter that tournament, he\\'s much too young! I thought they were all safe, I thought there was going to be an age limit!\\' She was in floods after that Daily Prophet article about him. \\'He still cries about his parents! Oh bless him, I never knew!\"\\n\\nHarry had had enough. Trusting to the fact that Hagrid wouldn\\'t miss him, with the attractions of four dragons and Madame Maxime to occupy him, he turned silently and began to walk away, back to the castle.\\n\\nHe didn\\'t know whether he was glad he\\'d seen what was coming or not. Perhaps this way was better. The first shock was over now. Maybe if he\\'d seen the dragons for the first time on Tuesday, he would have passed out cold in front of the whole school. . . but maybe he would anyway. .. . He was going to be armed with his wand � which, just now, felt like nothing more than a narrow strip of wood �� against a fifty�foot�high, scaly, spike�ridden, fire�breathing dragon. And he had to get past it. With everyone watching. How!\\n\\nHarry sped up, skirting the edge of the forest; he had just under fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside and talk to Sirius, and he couldn\\'t remember, ever, wanting to talk to someone more than he did right now �� when, without warning, he ran into something very solid.\\n\\nHarry fell backward, his glasses askew, clutching the cloak around him. A voice nearby said, \"Ouch! Who\\'s there?\"\\n\\nHarry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and hay very still, staring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit. He recognized the goatee. . . it was Karkaroff.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s there?\" said Karkaroff again, very suspiciously, looking around in the darkness. Harry remained still and silent. After a minute or so, Karkaroff seemed to decide that he had hit some sort of animal; he was looking around at waist height, as though expecting to see a dog. Then he crept back under the cover of the trees and started to edge forward toward the place where the dragons were.\\n\\nVery slowly and very carefully, Harry got to his feet and set off again as fast as he could without making too much noise, hurrying through the darkness back toward Hogwarts.\\n\\nHe had no doubt whatsoever what Karkaroff was up to. He had sneaked off his ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be. He might even have spotted Hagrid and Madame Maxime heading off around the forest together � they were hardly difficult to spot at a distance. . . and now all Karkaroff had to do was follow the sound of voices, and he, like Madame Maxime, would know what was in store for the champions.\\n\\nBy the looks of it, the only champion who would be facing the unknown on Tuesday was Cedric.\\n\\nHarry reached the castle, slipped in through the front doors, and began to climb the marble stairs; he was very out of breath, but he didn\\'t dare slow down. . . . He had less than five minutes to get up to the fire.\\n\\n\"Balderdash!\" he gasped at the Fat Lady, who was snoozing in her frame in front of the portrait hole.\\n\\n\"If you say so,\" she muttered sleepily, without opening her eyes, and the picture swung forward to admit him. Harry climbed inside. The common room was\\n\\ndeserted, and, judging by the fact that it smelled quite normal, Hermione had not needed to set off any Dungbombs to ensure that he and Sirius got privacy.\\n\\nHarry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and threw himself into an armchair in front of the fire. The room was in semidarkness; the flames were the only source of light. Nearby, on a table, the Support Cedric Diggory! badges the Creeveys had been trying to improve were glinting in the firelight. They now read POTTER REALLY STINKS. Harry looked back into the flames, and jumped.\\n\\nSirius\\'s head was sitting in the fire. If Harry hadn\\'t seen Mr. Diggory do exactly this back in the Weasleys\\' kitchen, it would have scared him out of his wits.\\n\\nInstead, his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days, he scrambled out of his chair, crouched down by the hearth, and said, \"Sirius � how\\'re you doing?\"\\n\\nSirius looked different from Harry\\'s memory of him. When they had said good� bye, Sirius\\'s face had been gaunt and sunken, surrounded by a quantity of long, black, matted hair � but the hair was short and clean now, Sirius\\'s face was fuller, and he looked younger, much more like the only photograph Harry had of him, which had been taken at the Potters\\' wedding.\\n\\n\"Never mind me, how are you?\" said Sirius seriously.\\n\\n\"I\\'m �\" For a second, Harry tried to say \"fine\" � but he couldn\\'t do it. Before he could stop himself, he was talking more than he\\'d talked in days � about how no one believed he hadn\\'t entered the tournament of his own free will, how Rita Skeeter had lied about him in the Daily Prophet, how he couldn\\'t walk down a corridor without being sneered at � and about Ron, Ron not believing him, Ron\\'s jealousy...\\n\\n\". . . and now Hagrid\\'s just shown me what\\'s coming in the first task, and it\\'s dragons, Sirius, and I\\'m a goner,\" he finished desperately.\\n\\nSirius looked at him, eyes full of concern, eyes that had not yet lost the look that Azkaban had given them � that deadened, haunted look He had let Harry talk himself into silence without interruption, but now he said, \"Dragons we can deal with, Harry, but we\\'ll get to that in a minute � I haven\\'t got long here. . . I\\'ve broken into a wizarding house to use the fire, but they could be back at any time.\\n\\nThere are things I need to warn you about.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry, feeling his spirits slip a further few notches.. . . Surely there could be nothing worse than dragons coming!\\n\\n\"Karkaroff,\" said Sirius. \"Harry, he was a Death Eater. You know what Death Eaters are, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes � he � what?\"\\n\\n\"He was caught, he was in Azkaban with me, but he got released. I\\'d bet\\n\\neverything that\\'s why Dumbledore wanted an Auror at Hogwarts this year � to keep an eye on him. Moody caught Karkaroff. Put him into Azkaban in the first place.\"\\n\\n\"Karkaroff got released?\" Harry said slowly � his brain seemed to be struggling to absorb yet another piece of shocking information. \"Why did they release him?\"\\n\\n\"He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic,\" said Sirius bitterly. \"He said he\\'d seen the error of his ways, and then he named names. . . he put a load of other people into Azkaban in his place. . . . He\\'s not very popular in there, I can tell you. And since he got out, from what I can tell, he\\'s been teaching the Dark Arts to every student who passes through that school of his. So watch out for the Durmstrang champion as well.\"\\n\\n\"Okay,\" said Harry slowly. \"But. . . are you saying Karkaroff put my name in the goblet? Because if he did, he\\'s a really good actor. He seemed furious about it. He wanted to stop me from competing.\"\\n\\n\"We know he\\'s a good actor,\" said Sirius, \"because he convinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free, didn\\'t he? Now, I\\'ve been keeping an eye on the Daily Prophet, Harry..\"\\n\\n\"� you and the rest of the world,\" said Harry bitterly.\\n\\n\"� and reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman\\'s article last month, Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts. Yes, I know she says it was another false alarm,\" Sirius said hastily, seeing Harry about to speak, \"but I don\\'t think so, somehow. I think someone tried to stop him from getting to Hogwarts. I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around. And no one\\'s going to look into it too closely; Mad�Eye\\'s heard intruders a bit too often. But that doesn\\'t mean he can\\'t still spot the real thing. Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had.\"\\n\\n\"So. . . what are you saying?\" said Harry slowly. \"Karkaroff\\'s trying to kill me!\\n\\nBut � why?\"\\n\\nSirius hesitated.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been nearing some very strange things,\" he said slowly. \"The Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately. They showed themselves at the Quidditch World Cup, didn\\'t they? Someone set off the Dark Mark.. . and then � did you hear about that Ministry of Magic witch who\\'s gone missing?\"\\n\\n\"Bertha Jorkins?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Exactly. . . she disappeared in Albania, and that\\'s definitely where Voldemort was rumored to be last. . . and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn\\'t she?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, but. . . it\\'s not very likely she\\'d have walked straight into Voldemort, is it?\"\\n\\nsaid Harry.\\n\\n\"Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,\" said Sirius grimly. \"She was at Hogwarts when I was, a few years above your dad and me. And she was an idiot. Very nosy, but no brains, none at all. It\\'s not a good combination, Harry. I\\'d say she\\'d be very easy to lure into a trap.\"\\n\\n\"So. . . so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament?\" said Harry. \"Is that what you mean? You think Karkaroff might be here on his orders?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Sirius slowly, \"I just don\\'t know...Karkaroff doesn\\'t strike me as the type who\\'d go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was powerful enough to protect him. But whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason, and I can\\'t help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to attack you and make it hook like an accident.\"\\n\\n\"Looks hike a really good plan from where I\\'m standing,\" said Harry grinning bleaky. \"They\\'ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff.\"\\n\\n\"Right � these dragons,\" said Sirius, speaking very quickly now. \"There\\'s a way, Harry. Don\\'t be tempted to try a Stunning Spell � dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon �\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I know, I just saw,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"But you can do it alone,\" said Sirius. \"There is away, and a simple spell\\'s all you need. Just �\"\\n\\nBut Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart suddenly pounding as though it would burst. He could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind him.\\n\\n\"Go!\" he hissed at Sirius. \" Go! There\\'s someone coming!\"\\n\\nHarry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire � if someone saw Sirius\\'s face within the walls of Hogwarts, they would raise an almighty uproar � the Ministry would get dragged in � he, Harry, would be questioned about Sirius\\'s whereabouts � Harry heard a tiny pop! in the fire behind him and knew Sirius had gone. He watched the bottom of the spiral staircase. Who had decided to go for a stroll at one o\\'clock in the morning, and stopped Sirius from telling him how to get past a dragon!\\n\\nIt was Ron. Dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas, Ron stopped dead facing Harry across the room, and looked around.\\n\\n\"Who were you talking to?\" he said.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that got to do with you?\" Harry snarled. \"What are you doing down here at this time of night?\"\\n\\n\"I just wondered where you �\" Ron broke off, shrugging. \"Nothing. I\\'m going back to bed.\"\\n\\n\"Just thought you\\'d come nosing around, did you?\" Harry shouted. He knew that Ron had no idea what he\\'d walked in on, knew he hadn\\'t done it on purpose, but he didn\\'t care � at this moment he hated everything about Ron, right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama trousers.\\n\\n\"Sorry about that,\" said Ron, his face reddening with anger. \"Should\\'ve realized you didn\\'t want to be disturbed. I\\'ll let you get on with practicing for your next interview in peace.\"\\n\\nHarry seized one of the POTTER REALLY STINKS badges off the table and chucked it, as hard as he could, across the room. It hit Ron on the forehead and bounced off.\\n\\n\"There you go,\" Harry said. \"Something for you to wear on Tuesday. You might even have a scar now, if yon\\'re lucky.. . . That\\'s what you want, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\nHe strode across the room toward the stairs; he half expected Ron to stop him, he would even have liked Ron to throw a punch at him, but Ron just stood there in his too�small pajamas, and Harry, having stormed upstairs, lay awake in bed fuming for a long time afterward and didn\\'t hear him come up to bed.\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY � THE FIRST TASK\\n\\nHarry got up on Sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock.\\n\\nWhen he\\'d finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body, he hurried off to find Hermione, locating her at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, where she was eating breakfast with Ginny. Feeling too queasy to eat, Harry waited until Hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge, then dragged her out onto the grounds. There, he told her all about the dragons, and about everything Sirius had said, while they took another long walk around the lake.\\n\\nAlarmed as she was by Sirius\\'s warnings about Karkaroff, Hermione still thought that the dragons were the more pressing problem.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s just try and keep you alive until Tuesday evening,\" she said desperately, \"and then we can worry about Karkaroff.\"\\n\\nThey walked three times around the lake, trying all the way to think of a simple spell that would subdue a dragon. Nothing whatsoever occurred to them, so they retired to the library instead. Here, Harry pulled down every book he could find on dragons, and both of them set to work searching through the large pile.\\n\\n\"Talon�clipping by charms. .. treating scale�rot. . .\\' This is no good, this is for nutters like Hagrid who want to keep them healthy. ..\\n\\n\"Dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides, which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate. . .\\' But Sirius said a simple one would do it.. .\\n\\n\"Let\\'s try some simple spellbooks, then,\" said Harry, throwing aside Men Who Love Dragons Too Much.\\n\\nHe returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks, set them down, and began to flick through each in turn, Hermione whispering nonstop at his elbow.\\n\\n\"Well, there are Switching Spells. . . but what\\'s the point of Switching it? Unless you swapped its fangs for wine�gums or something that would make it less dangerous.. . . The trouble is, like that book said, not much is going to get through a dragon\\'s hide. . . . I\\'d say Transfigure it, but something that big, you really haven\\'t got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall. . . unless you\\'re supposed to put the spell on yourself? Maybe to give yourself extra powers? But they\\'re not simple spells, I mean, we haven\\'t done any of those in class, I only know about them because I\\'ve been doing O.W.L. practice papers. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Hermione,\" Harry said, through gritted teeth, \"will you shut up for a bit, please? I m trying to concentrate.\"\\n\\nBut all that happened, when Hermione fell silent, was that Harry\\'s brain filled with a sort of blank buzzing, which didn\\'t seem to allow room for concentration. He stared hopelessly down the index of Basic Hexes for the Busy and Vexed. Instant scalping. . . but dragons had no hair. . . pepper breath.. . that would probably increase a dragon\\'s firepower. . . horn tongue. . . just what he needed, to give it an extra weapon...\\n\\n\"Oh no, he\\'s back again, why can\\'t he read on his stupid ship?\" said Hermione irritably as Viktor Krum slouched in, cast a surly look over at the pair of them, and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of books. \"Come on, Harry, we\\'ll go back to the common room. . . his fan club\\'ll be here in a moment, twittering away... .\"\\n\\nAnd sure enough, as they left the library, a gang of girls tiptoed past them, one of them wearing a Bulgaria scarf tied around her waist.\\n\\nHarry barely slept that night. When he awoke on Monday morning, he seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from Hogwarts. But as he looked around the Great Hall at breakfast time, and thought about what leaving the castle would mean, he knew he couldn\\'t do it. It was the only place he had ever been happy. . . well, he supposed he must have been happy with his parents too, but he couldn\\'t remember that.\\n\\nSomehow, the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on Privet Drive with Dudley was good to know; it made him feel slightly calmer. He finished his bacon with difficulty (his throat wasn\\'t working too well), and as he and Hermione got up, he saw Cedric Diggory leaving the Hufflepuff table.\\n\\nCedric still didn\\'t know about the dragons. . . the only champion who didn\\'t, if Harry was right in thinking that Maxime and Karkaroff would have told Fleur and Krum....\\n\\n\"Hermione, I\\'ll see you in the greenhouses,\" Harry said, coming to his decision as he watched Cedric leaving the Hall. \"Go on, I\\'ll catch you up.\"\\n\\n\"Harry, you\\'ll be late, the bell\\'s about to ring �\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll catch you up, okay?\"\\n\\nBy the time Harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase, Cedric was at the top. He was with a load of sixth�year friends. Harry didn\\'t want to talk to Cedric in front of them; they were among those who had been quoting Rita Skeeter\\'s article at him every time he went near them. He followed Cedric at a distance and saw that he was heading toward the Charms corridor. This gave Harry an idea. Pausing at a distance from them, he pulled out his wand, and took careful aim.\\n\\n\"Diffindo!\"\\n\\nCedric\\'s bag split. Parchment, quills, and books spilled out of it onto the floor.\\n\\nSeveral bottles of ink smashed.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t bother,\" said Cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down to help him. \"Tell Flitwick I\\'m coming, go on. . .\\n\\nThis was exactly what Harry had been hoping for. He slipped his wand back into his robes, waited until Cedric\\'s friends had disappeared into their classroom, and hurried up the corridor, which was now empty of everyone but himself and Cedric.\\n\\n\"Hi,\" said Cedric, picking up a copy of A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration that was now splattered with ink. \"My bag just split. . . brand�new and all. . .\"\\n\\n\"Cedric,\" said Harry, \"the first task is dragons.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Cedric, looking up.\\n\\n\"Dragons,\" said Harry, speaking quickly, in case Professor Flitwick came out to see where Cedric had got to. \"They\\'ve got four, one for each of us, and we\\'ve got to get past them.\"\\n\\nCedric stared at him. Harry saw some of the panic he\\'d been feeling since Saturday night flickering in Cedric\\'s gray eyes.\\n\\n\"Are you sure?\" Cedric said in a hushed voice.\\n\\n\"Dead sure,\" said Harry. \"I\\'ve seen them.\"\\n\\n\"But how did you find out? We\\'re not supposed to know. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Never mind,\" said Harry quickly � he knew Hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth. \"But I\\'m not the only one who knows. Fleur and Krum will know by now � Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the dragons too.\"\\n\\nCedric straightened up, his arms full of inky quills, parchment, and books, his ripped bag dangling off one shoulder. He stared at Harry, and there was a puzzled, almost suspicious look in his eyes.\\n\\n\"Why are you telling me?\" he asked.\\n\\nHarry looked at him in disbelief. He was sure Cedric wouldn\\'t have asked that if he had seen the dragons himself. Harry wouldn\\'t have let his worst enemy face those monsters unprepared � well, perhaps Malfoy or Snape...\\n\\n\"It\\'s just . . . fair, isn\\'t it?\" he said to Cedric. \"We all know now. . . we\\'re on an even footing, aren\\'t we?\"\\n\\nCedric was still hooking at him in a slightly suspicious way when Harry heard a familiar clunking noise behind him. He turned around and saw Mad�Eye Moody emerging from a nearby classroom.\\n\\n\"Come with me, Potter,\" he growled. \"Diggory, off you go.\"\\n\\nHarry stared apprehensively at Moody. Had he overheard them!\\n\\n\"Er � Professor, I\\'m supposed to be in Herbology �\"\\n\\n\"Never mind that, Potter. In my office, please...\\n\\nHarry followed him, wondering what was going to happen to him now. What if Moody wanted to know how he\\'d found out about the dragons? Would Moody go to Dumbledore and tell on Hagrid, or just turn Harry into a ferret? Well, it might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret, Harry thought dully, he\\'d be smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet..\\n\\nHe followed Moody into his office. Moody closed the door behind them and turned to look at Harry, his magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal one.\\n\\n\"That was a very decent thing you just did, Potter,\" Moody said quietly.\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t know what to say; this wasn\\'t the reaction he had expected at all.\\n\\n\"Sit down,\" said Moody, and Harry sat, looking around.\\n\\nHe had visited this office under two of its previous occupants. In Professor Lockhart\\'s day, the walls had been plastered with beaming, winking pictures of Professor Lockhart himself. When Lupin had lived here, you were more likely to come across a specimen of some fascinating new Dark creature he had procured for them to study in class. Now, however, the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that Harry supposed Moody had used in the days when he had been an Auror.\\n\\nOn his desk stood what looked hike a large, cracked, glass spinning top; Harry recognized it at once as a Sneakoscope, because he owned one himself, though it was much smaller than Moody\\'s. In the corner on a small table stood an object that looked something like an extra�squiggly, golden television aerial. It was humming slightly. What appeared to be a mirror hung opposite Harry on the wall, but it was not reflecting the room. Shadowy figures were moving around inside it, none of them clearly in focus.\\n\\n\"Like my Dark Detectors, do you?\" s aid Moody, who was watching Harry closely.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" Harry asked, pointing at the squiggly golden aerial.\\n\\n\"Secrecy Sensor. Vibrates when it detects concealment and lies.. . no use here, of course, too much interference � students in every direction lying about why they haven\\'t done their homework Been humming ever since I got here. I had to disable my Sneakoscope because it wouldn\\'t stop whistling. It\\'s extra�sensitive, picks up stuff about a mile around. Of course, it could be picking up more than kid stuff,\"\\n\\nhe added in a growl.\\n\\n\"And what\\'s the mirror for?\"\\n\\n\"Oh that\\'s my Foe�Glass. See them out there, skulking around? I\\'m not really in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes. That\\'s when I open my trunk.\"\\n\\nHe let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the large trunk under the window. It had seven keyholes in a row. Harry wondered what was in there, until Moody\\'s next question brought him sharply back to earth.\\n\\n\"So. . . found out about the dragons, have you?\"\\n\\nHarry hesitated. He\\'d been afraid of this � but he hadn\\'t told Cedric, and he certainly wasn\\'t going to tell Moody, that Hagrid had broken the rules.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right,\" said Moody, sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg with a groan. \"Cheating\\'s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t cheat,\" said Harry sharply. \"It was � a sort of accident that I found out.\"\\n\\nMoody grinned. \"I wasn\\'t accusing you, laddie. I\\'ve been telling Dumbledore from the start, he can be as high�minded as he likes, but you can bet old Karkaroff and Maxime won\\'t be. They\\'ll have told their champions everything they can. They want to win. They want to beat Dumbledore. They\\'d like to prove he\\'s only human.\"\\n\\nMoody gave another harsh laugh, and his magical eye swiveled around so fast it made Harry feel queasy to watch it.\\n\\n\"So. . . got any ideas how you\\'re going to get past your dragon yet?\" said Moody.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m not going to tell you,\" said Moody gruffly. \"I don\\'t show favoritism, me. I\\'m just going to give you some good, general advice. And the first bit is � play to your strengths.\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t got any,\" said Harry, before he could stop himself. \"Excuse me,\"\\n\\ngrowled Moody, \"you\\'ve got strengths if I say you\\'ve got them. Think now. What are you best at?\"\\n\\nHarry tried to concentrate. What was he best at? Well, that was easy, really �� \"Quidditch,\" he said dully, \"and a fat lot of help �\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" said Moody, staring at him very hard, his magical eye barely moving at all. \"You\\'re a damn good flier from what I\\'ve heard.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, but.. .\" Harry stared at him. \"I\\'m not allowed a broom, I\\'ve only got my wand...\"\\n\\n\"My second piece of general advice,\" said Moody loudly, interrupting him, \"is to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to get what you need.\"\\n\\nHarry looked at him blankly. What did he need!\\n\\n\"Come on, boy. . .\" whispered Moody. \"Put them together... it\\'s not that difficult...\"\\n\\nAnd it clicked. He was best at flying. He needed to pass the dragon in the air. For that, he needed his Firebolt. And for his Fire�bolt, he needed � \"Hermione,\" Harry whispered, when he had sped into greenhouse three minutes later, uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout as he passed her. \"Hermione � I need you to help me.\"\\n\\n\"What d\\'you think I\\'ve been trying to do, Harry?\" she whispered back, her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was pruning.\\n\\n\"Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by tomorrow afternoon.\"\\n\\nAnd so they practiced. They didn\\'t have lunch, but headed for a free classroom, where Harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room toward him. He was still having problems. The books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping hike stones to the floor.\\n\\n\"Concentrate, Harry, concentrate. . . .\"\\n\\n\"What d\\'you think I\\'m trying to do?\" said Harry angrily. \"A great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason...Okay, try again. . . .\"\\n\\nHe wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but Hermione refused point� blank to skive off Arithmancy, and there was no point in staying without her. He therefore had to endure over an hour of Professor Trelawney, who spent half the lesson telling everyone that the position of Mars with relation to Saturn at that moment meant that people born in July were in great danger of sudden, violent deaths.\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s good,\" said Harry loudly, his temper getting the better of him, \"just as long as it\\'s not drawn�out. I don\\'t want to suffer.\"\\n\\nRon looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh; he certainly caught Harry\\'s eye for the first time in days, but Harry was still feeling too resentful toward Ron to care. He spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the table with his wand. He managed to make a fly zoom straight into his hand, though he wasn\\'t entirely sure that was his prowess at Summoning Charms � perhaps the fly was just stupid.\\n\\nHe forced down some dinner after Divination, then returned to the empty classroom with Hermione, using the Invisibility Cloak to avoid the teachers. They\\n\\nkept practicing until past midnight. They would have stayed longer, but Peeves turned up and, pretending to think that Harry wanted things thrown at him, started chucking chairs across the room. Harry and Hermione left in a hurry before the noise attracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor common room, which was now mercifully empty.\\n\\nAt two o\\'clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace, surrounded by heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of Gobstones, and Neville\\'s toad, Trevor. Only in the last hour had Harry really got the hang of the Summoning Charm.\\n\\n\"That\\'s better, Harry, that\\'s loads better,\" Hermione said, looking exhausted but very pleased.\\n\\n\"Well, now we know what to do next time I can\\'t manage a spell,\" Harry said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again, \"threaten me with a dragon. Right...\" He raised his wand once more. \"Accio Dictionary!\"\\n\\nThe heavy book soared out of Hermione\\'s hand, flew across the room, and Harry caught it.\\n\\n\"Harry, I really think you\\'ve got it!\" said Hermione delightedly.\\n\\n\"Just as long as it works tomorrow,\" Harry said. \"The Firebolt\\'s going to be much farther away than the stuff in here, it\\'s going to be in the castle, and I\\'m going to be out there on the grounds. . . .\"\\n\\n\"That doesn\\'t matter,\" said Hermione firmly.\" Just as long as you\\'re concentrating really, really hard on it, it\\'ll come. Harry, we\\'d better get some sleep.. . you\\'re going to need it.\"\\n\\nHarry had been focusing so hard on learning the Summoning Charm that evening that some of his blind panic had heft him. It returned in full measure, however, on the following morning. The atmosphere in the school was one of great tension and excitement. Lessons were to stop at midday, giving all the students time to get down to the dragons\\' enclosure � though of course, they didn\\'t yet know what they would find there.\\n\\nHarry felt oddly separate from everyone around him, whether they were wishing him good luck or hissing \"We\\'ll have a box of tissues ready, Potter\" as he passed.\\n\\nIt was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he mightn\\'t just lose his head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon, and start trying to curse everyone in sight. Time was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever, rushing past in great dollops, so that one moment he seemed to be sitting down in his first lesson, History of Magic, and the next, walking into lunch.. . and then (where had the morning gone? the last of the dragon�free hours?), Professor McGonagall was hurrying over to him in the Great Hall. Lots of people were watching.\\n\\n\"Potter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds now... . You have to get ready for your first task.\"\\n\\n\"Okay,\" said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto his plate with a clatter.\\n\\n\"Good luck, Harry,\" Hermione whispered. \"You\\'ll be fine!\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry in a voice that was most unlike his own.\\n\\nHe heft the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall. She didn\\'t seem herself either; in fact, she looked nearly as anxious as Hermione. As she walked him down the stone steps and out into the cold November afternoon, she put her hand on his shoulder.\\n\\n\"Now, don\\'t panic,\" she said, \"just keep a cool head. . . . We\\'ve got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of hand. . . . The main thing is just to do your best, and nobody will think any the worse of you. . . . Are you all right?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" Harry heard himself say. \"Yes, I\\'m fine.\"\\n\\nShe was leading him toward the place where the dragons were, around the edge of the forest, but when they approached the clump of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible, Harry saw that a tent had been erected, its entrance facing them, screening the dragons from view.\\n\\n\"You\\'re to go in here with the other champions,\" said Professor McGonagall, in a rather shaky sort of voice, \"and wait for your turn, Potter. Mr. Bagman is in there.\\n\\n. . he\\'ll be telling you the � the procedure. . . . Good luck.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, in a flat, distant voice. She left him at the entrance of the tent. Harry went inside.\\n\\nFleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a how wooden stool. She didn\\'t look nearly as composed as usual, but rather pale and clammy. Viktor Krum looked even surlier than usual, which Harry supposed was his way of showing nerves.\\n\\nCedric was pacing up and down. When Harry entered, Cedric gave him a small smile, which Harry returned, feeling the muscles in his face working rather hard, as though they had forgotten how to do it.\\n\\n\"Harry! Good�o!\" said Bagman happily, looking around at him. \"Come in, come in, make yourself at home!\"\\n\\nBagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure, standing amid all the pale�faced champions. He was wearing his old Wasp robes again.\\n\\n\"Well, now we\\'re all here � time to fill you in!\" said Bagman brightly. \"When the audience has assembled, I\\'m going to be offering each of you this bag\" � he held up a small sack of purple silk and shook it at them � \"from which you will each select a small model of the thing you are about to face! There are different � er �\\n\\nvarieties, you see. And I have to tell you something else too.. . ah, yes... your task is to collect the golden egg!\"\\n\\nHarry glanced around. Cedric had nodded once, to show that he understood Bagman\\'s words, and then started pacing around the tent again; he looked slightly green. Fleur Delacour and Krum hadn\\'t reacted at all. Perhaps they thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths; that was certainly how Harry felt. But they, at least, had volunteered for this. .\\n\\nAnd in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be heard passing the tent, their owners talking excitedly, laughing, joking. . . . Harry felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species. And then � it seemed like about a second later to Harry � Bagman was opening the neck of the purple silk sack.\\n\\n\"Ladies first,\" he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour.\\n\\nShe put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny, perfect model of a dragon � a Welsh Green. It had the number two around its neck And Harry knew, by the fact that Fleur showed no sign of surprise, but rather a determined resignation, that he had been right: Madame Maxime had told her what was coming.\\n\\nThe same held true for Krum. He pulled out the scarlet Chinese Fireball. It had a number three around its neck. He didn\\'t even blink, just sat back down and stared at the ground.\\n\\nCedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the blueish�gray Swedish Short� Snout, the number one tied around its neck. Knowing what was left, Harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the Hungarian Horntail, and the number four.\\n\\nIt stretched its wings as he looked down at it, and bared its minuscule fangs.\\n\\n\"Well, there you are!\" said Bagman. \"You have each pulled out the dragon you will face, and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on the dragons, do you see? Now, I\\'m going to have to leave you in a moment, because I\\'m commentating. Mr. Diggory, you\\'re first, just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle, all right? Now. . . Harry. . . could I have a quick word!\\n\\nOutside?\"\\n\\n\"Er. . . yes,\" said Harry blankly, and he got up and went out of the tent with Bagman, who walked him a short distance away, into the trees, and then turned to him with a fatherly expression on his face.\\n\\n\"Feeling all right, Harry? Anything I can get you?\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry. \"I � no, nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Got a plan?\" said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially. \"Because I don\\'t mind sharing a few pointers, if you\\'d like them, you know. I mean,\" Bagman\\n\\ncontinued, lowering his voice still further, \"you\\'re the underdog here, Harry. . . .\\n\\nAnything I can do to help. . .\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude, \"no � I � I know what I\\'m going to do, thanks.\"\\n\\n\"Nobody would know, Harry,\" said Bagman, winking at him.\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m fine,\" said Harry, wondering why he kept telling people this, and wondering whether he had ever been less fine. \"I\\'ve got a plan worked out, I �\"\\n\\nA whistle had blown somewhere.\\n\\n\"Good lord, I\\'ve got to run!\" said Bagman in alarm, and he hurried off.\\n\\nHarry walked back to the tent and saw Cedric emerging from it, greener than ever.\\n\\nHarry tried to wish him luck as he walked past, but all that came out of his mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt.\\n\\nHarry went back inside to Fleur and Krum. Seconds hater, they heard the roar of the crowd, which meant Cedric had entered the enclosure and was now face�to� face with the living counterpart of his model.\\n\\nIt was worse than Harry could ever have imagined, sitting there and listening. The crowd screamed. . . yelled.. . gasped like a single many�headed entity, as Cedric did whatever he was doing to get past the Swedish Short�Snout. Krum was still staring at the ground. Fleur had now taken to retracing Cedric\\'s steps, around and around the tent. And Bagman\\'s commentary made everything much, much worse..\\n\\n. . Horrible pictures formed in Harry\\'s mind as he heard: \"Oooh, narrow miss there, very narrow\". . . \"He\\'s taking risks, this one!\". . . \"Clever move � pity it didn\\'t work!\"\\n\\nAnd then, after about fifteen minutes, Harry heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing: Cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the golden egg.\\n\\n\"Very good indeed!\" Bagman was shouting. \"And now the marks from the judges!\"\\n\\nBut he didn\\'t shout out the marks; Harry supposed the judges were holding them up and showing them to the crowd.\\n\\n\"One down, three to go!\" Bagman yelled as the whistle blew again. \"Miss Delacour, if you please!\"\\n\\nFleur was trembling from head to foot; Harry felt more warmly toward her than he had done so far as she heft the tent with her head held high and her hand clutching her wand. He and Krum were left alone, at opposite sides of the tent, avoiding each other\\'s gaze.\\n\\nThe same process started again. . . .\"Oh I\\'m not sure that was wise!\" they could hear Bagman shouting gleefully. \"Oh. . . nearly! Careful now. . . good lord, I thought she\\'d had it then!\"\\n\\nTen minutes later, Harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once more. . . . Fleur must have been successful too. A pause, while Fleur\\'s marks were being shown. . .\\n\\nmore clapping.. . then, for the third time, the whistle.\\n\\n\"And here comes Mr. Krum!\" cried Bagman, and Krum slouched out, leaving Harry quite alone.\\n\\nHe felt much more aware of his body than usual; very aware of the way his heart was pumping fast, and his fingers tingling with fear. . . yet at the same time, he seemed to be outside himself, seeing the walls of the tent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far away.\\n\\n\"Very daring!\" Bagman was yelling, and Harry heard the Chinese Fireball emit a horrible, roaring shriek, while the crowd drew its collective breath. \"That\\'s some nerve he\\'s showing � and � yes, he\\'s got the egg!\"\\n\\nApplause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass; Krum had finished � it would be Harry\\'s turn any moment.\\n\\nHe stood up, noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of marshmallow. He waited. And then he heard the whistle blow. He walked out through the entrance of the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo inside him. And now he was walking past the trees, through a gap in the enclosure fence.\\n\\nHe saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly colored dream.\\n\\nThere were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that had been magicked there since he\\'d last stood on this spot. And there was the Horntail, at the other end of the enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of eggs, her wings half�furled, her evil, yellow eyes upon him, a monstrous, scaly, black lizard, thrashing her spiked tail, heaving yard�long gouge marks in the hard ground. The crowd was making a great deal of noise, but whether friendly or not, Harry didn\\'t know or care. It was time to do what he had to do. . . to focus his mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing that was his only chance.\\n\\nHe raised his wand.\\n\\n\"Accio Firebolt!\" he shouted.\\n\\nHarry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying. . . . If it hadn\\'t worked. . . if it wasn\\'t coming. . . He seemed to be looking at everything around him through some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangely....\\n\\nAnd then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him; he turned and saw his Firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods, soaring into the\\n\\nenclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside him, waiting for him to mount. The crowd was making even more noise. . . . Bagman was shouting something. . . but Harry\\'s ears were not working properly anymore. . . listening wasn\\'t important....\\n\\nHe swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground. And a second later, something miraculous happened....\\n\\nAs he soared upward, as the wind rushed through his hair, as the crowd\\'s faces became mere flesh�colored pinpnicks below, and the Horntail shrank to the size of a dog, he realized that he had heft not only the ground behind, but also his fear. . . .\\n\\nHe was back where he belonged....\\n\\nThis was just another Quidditch match, that was all. . . just another Quidditch match, and that Horntail was just another ugly opposing team.\\n\\nHe looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one, gleaming against its cement�colored fellows, residing safely between the dragon\\'s front legs.\\n\\n\"Okay,\" Harry told himself, \"diversionary tactics. . . let\\'s go. . .\"\\n\\nHe dived. The Horntail\\'s head followed him; he knew what it was going to do and pulled out of the dive just in time; a jet of fire had been released exactly where he would have been had he not swerved away. . . but Harry didn\\'t care.. . that was no more than dodging a Bludger.\\n\\n\"Great Scott, he can fly!\" yelled Bagman as the crowd shrieked and gasped. \"Are you watching this, Mr. Krum?\"\\n\\nHarry soared higher in a circle; the Horntail was still following his progress; its head revolving on its long neck � if he kept this up, it would be nicely dizzy � but better not push it too long, or it would be breathing fire again � Harry plummeted just as the Horntail opened its mouth, but this time he was less lucky � he missed the flames, but the tail came whipping up to meet him instead, and as he swerved to the left, one of the long spikes grazed his shoulder, ripping his robes �� He could feel it stinging, he could hear screaming and groans from the crowd, but the cut didn\\'t seem to be deep. . . . Now he zoomed around the back of the Horntail, and a possibility occurred to him....\\n\\nThe Horntail didn\\'t seem to want to take off, she was too protective of her eggs.\\n\\nThough she writhed and twisted, furling and unfurling her wings and keeping those fearsome yellow eyes on Harry, she was afraid to move too far from them. . .\\n\\nbut he had to persuade her to do it, or he\\'d never get near them. . . . The trick was to do it carefully, gradually....\\n\\nHe began to fly, first this way, then the other, not near enough to make her breathe fire to stave him off, but still posing a sufficient threat to ensure she kept her eyes on him. Her head swayed this way and that, watching him out of those vertical\\n\\npupils, her fangs bared...\\n\\nHe flew higher. The Horntail\\'s head rose with him, her neck now stretched to its fullest extent, still swaying, hike a snake before its charmer. . .\\n\\nHarry rose a few more feet, and she let out a roar of exasperation. He was like a fly to her, a fly she was longing to swat; her tail thrashed again, but he was too high to reach now. . . . She shot fire into the air, which he dodged.. . . Her jaws opened wide....\\n\\n\"Come on,\" Harry hissed, swerving tantalizingly above her, \"come on, come and get me. . . up you get now. .\"\\n\\nAnd then she reared, spreading her great, black, leathery wings at last, as wide as those of a small airplane � and Harry dived. Before the dragon knew what he had done, or where he had disappeared to, he was speeding toward the ground as fast as he could go, toward the eggs now unprotected by her clawed front legs � he had taken his hands off his Firebolt � he had seized the golden egg � And with a huge spurt of speed, he was off, he was soaring out over the stands, the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm, and it was as though somebody had just turned the volume back up � for the first time, he became properly aware of the noise of the crowd, which was screaming and applauding as loudly as the Irish supporters at the World Cup � \"Look at that!\" Bagman was yelling. \"Will you look at that! Our youngest champion is quickest to get his egg! Well, this is going to shorten the odds on Mr.\\n\\nPotter!\"\\n\\nHarry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the Horntail, and, over at the entrance to the enclosure, Professor McGonagalh, Professor Moody, and Hagrid hurrying to meet him, all of them waving him toward them, their smiles evident even from this distance. He flew back over the stands, the noise of the crowd pounding his eardrums, and came in smoothly to land, his heart lighter than it had been in weeks. . . . He had got through the first task, he had survived.\\n\\n\"That was excellent, Potter!\" cried Professor McGonagall as he got off the Firebolt � which from her was extravagant praise. He noticed that her hand shook as she pointed at his shoulder. \"You\\'ll need to see Madam Pomfrey before the judges give out your score. . . . Over there, she\\'s had to mop up Diggory already. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yeh did it, Harry!\" said Hagrid hoarsely. \"Yeh did it! An\\' agains\\' the Horntail an\\' all, an\\' yeh know Charlie said that was the wors\\' � \"\\n\\n\"Thanks, Hagrid,\" said Harry loudly, so that Hagrid wouldn\\'t blunder on and reveal that he had shown Harry the dragons beforehand.\\n\\nProfessor Moody looked very pleased too; his magical eye was dancing in its socket.\\n\\n\"Nice and easy does the trick, Potter,\" he growled.\\n\\n\"Right then, Potter, the first aid tent, please. . .\" said Professor McGonagall.\\n\\nHarry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and saw Madam Pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent, looking worried.\\n\\n\"Dragons!\" she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling Harry inside. The tent was divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric\\'s shadow through the canvas, but Cedric didn\\'t seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey examined Harry\\'s shoulder, talking furiously all the while. \"Last year dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next? You\\'re very lucky. . . this is quite shallow. . . it\\'ll need cleaning before I heal it up, though... .\"\\n\\nShe cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly.\\n\\n\"Now, just sit quietly for a minute � sit! And then you can go and get your score.\"\\n\\nShe bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say, \"How does it feel now, Diggory?\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t want to sit still: He was too full of adrenaline. He got to his feet, wanting to see what was going on outside, but before he\\'d reached the mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside � Hermione, followed closely by Ron.\\n\\n\"Harry, you were brilliant!\" Hermione said squeakily. There were fingernail marks on her face where she had been clutching it in fear. \"You were amazing! You really were!\"\\n\\nBut Harry was looking at Ron, who was very white and staring at Harry as though he were a ghost.\\n\\n\"Harry,\" he said, very seriously, \"whoever put your name in that goblet � I � I reckon they\\'re trying to do you in!\"\\n\\nIt was as though the last few weeks had never happened � as though Harry were meeting Ron for the first time, right after he\\'d been made champion.\\n\\n\"Caught on, have you?\" said Harry coldly. \"Took you long enough.\"\\n\\nHermione stood nervously between them, looking from one to the other. Ron opened his mouth uncertainly. Harry knew Ron was about to apologize and suddenly he found he didn\\'t need to hear it.\\n\\n\"It\\'s okay,\" he said, before Ron could get the words out. \"Forget it.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ron, \"I shouldn\\'t\\'ve �\"\\n\\n\"Forget it, \"Harry said.\\n\\nRon grinned nervously at him, and Harry grinned back Hermione burst into tears.\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing to cry about!\" Harry told her, bewildered.\\n\\n\"You two are so stupid!\" she shouted, stamping her foot on the ground, tears splashing down her front. Then, before either of them could stop her, she had given both of them a hug and dashed away, now positively howling.\\n\\n\"Barking mad,\" said Ron, shaking his head. \"Harry, c\\'mon, they\\'ll be putting up your scores. . . .\"\\n\\nPicking up the golden egg and his Firebolt, feeling more elated than he would have believed possible an hour ago, Harry ducked out of the tent, Ron by his side, talking fast.\\n\\n\"You were the best, you know, no competition. Cedric did this weird thing where he Transfigured a rock on the ground. . . turned it into a dog. . . he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him. Well, it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration, and it sort of worked, because he did get the egg, but he got burned as well � the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the Labrador; he only just got away. And that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm, I think she was trying to put it into a trance � well, that kind of worked too, it went all sleepy, but then it snored, and this great jet of flame shot out, and her skirt caught fire � she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand. And Krum � you won\\'t believe this, but he didn\\'t even think of flying! He was probably the best after you, though. Hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye. Only thing is, it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs � they took marks off for that, he wasn\\'t supposed to do any damage to them.\"\\n\\nRon drew breath as he and Harry reached the edge of the enclosure. Now that the Horntail had been taken away, Harry could see where the five judges were sitting � right at the other end, in raised seats draped in gold.\\n\\n\"It\\'s marks out of ten from each one,\" Ron said, and Harry squinting up the field, saw the first judge � Madame Maxime � raise her wand in the air. What hooked like a long silver ribbon shot out of it, which twisted itself into a large figure eight.\\n\\n\"Not bad!\" said Ron as the crowd applauded. \"I suppose she took marks off for your shoulder. . .\\n\\nMr. Crouch came next. He shot a number nine into the air.\\n\\n\"Looking good!\" Ron yelled, thumping Harry on the back.\\n\\nNext, Dumbledore. He too put up a nine. The crowd was cheering harder than ever.\\n\\nLudo Bagman � ten.\\n\\n\"Ten?\" said Harry in disbelief. \"But. . . I got hurt. . . . What\\'s he playing at?\"\\n\\n\"Harry, don\\'t complain!\" Ron yelled excitedly.\\n\\nAnd now Karkaroff raised his wand. He paused for a moment, and then a number shot out of his wand too � four.\\n\\n\"What?\" Ron bellowed furiously. \"Four? You lousy, biased scum�bag, you gave Krum ten!\"\\n\\nBut Harry didn\\'t care, he wouldn\\'t have cared if Karkaroff had given him zero; Ron\\'s indignation on his behalf was worth about a hundred points to him. He didn\\'t tell Ron this, of course, but his heart felt lighter than air as he turned to leave the enclosure. And it wasn\\'t just Ron. . . those weren\\'t only Gryffindors cheering in the crowd. When it had come to it, when they had seen what he was facing, most of the school had been on his side as well as Cedric\\'s. . . . He didn\\'t care about the Slytherins, he could stand whatever they threw at him now.\\n\\n\"You\\'re tied in first place, Harry! You and Krum!\" said Charlie Weasley, hurrying to meet them as they set off back toward the school. \"Listen, I\\'ve got to run, I\\'ve got to go and send Mum an owl, I swore I\\'d tell her what happened � but that was unbelievable! Oh yeah � and they told me to tell you you\\'ve got to hang around for a few more minutes.. . . Bagman wants a word, back in the champions\\' tent.\"\\n\\nRon said he would wait, so Harry reentered the tent, which somehow looked quite different now: friendly and welcoming. He thought back to how he\\'d felt while dodging the Horntail, and compared it to the long wait before he\\'d walked out to face it.... There was no comparison; the wait had been immeasurably worse.\\n\\nFleur, Cedric, and Krum all came in together. One side of Cedric\\'s face was covered in a thick orange paste, which was presumably mending his burn. He grinned at Harry when he saw him.\\n\\n\"Good one, Harry.\"\\n\\n\"And you,\" said Harry, grinning back.\\n\\n\"Well done, all of you!\" said Ludo Bagman, bouncing into the tent and looking as pleased as though he personally had just got past a dragon. \"Now, just a quick few words. You\\'ve got a nice long break before the second task, which will take place at half past nine on the morning of February the twenty�fourth � but we\\'re giving you something to think about in the meantime! If you look down at those golden eggs you\\'re all holding, you will see that they open. . . see the hinges there? You need to solve the clue inside the egg � because it will tell you what the second task is, and enable you to prepare for it! All clear? Sure? Well, off you go, then!\"\\n\\nHarry left the tent, rejoined Ron, and they started to walk back around the edge of the forest, talking hard; Harry wanted to hear what the other champions had done in more detail. Then, as they rounded the clump of trees behind which Harry had\\n\\nfirst heard the dragons roar, a witch leapt out from behind them.\\n\\nIt was Rita Skeeter. She was wearing acid�green robes today; the Quick�Quotes Quill in her hand blended perfectly against them.\\n\\n\"Congratulations, Harry!\" she said, beaming at him. \"I wonder if you could give me a quick word? How you felt facing that dragon? How you feel now, about the fairness of the scoring?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, you can have a word,\" said Harry savagely. \"Good�bye.\"\\n\\nAnd he set off back to the castle with Ron.\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY�ONE � THE HOUSE�ELF LIBERATION FRONT\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery that evening to find Pigwidgeon, so that Harry could send Sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get past his dragon unscathed. On the way, Harry filled Ron in on everything Sirius had told him about Karkaroff. Though shocked at first to hear that Karkaroff had been a Death Eater, by the time they entered the Owlery Ron was saying that they ought to have suspected it all along.\\n\\n\"Fits, doesn\\'t it?\" he said. \"Remember what Malfoy said on the train, about his dad being friends with Karkaroff? Now we know where they knew each other. They were probably running around in masks together at the World Cup.... I\\'ll tell you one thing, though, Harry, if it was Karkaroff who put your name in the goblet, he\\'s going to be feeling really stupid now, isn\\'t he? Didn\\'t work, did it? You only got a scratch! Come here � I\\'ll do it �\"\\n\\nPigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery he was flying around and around Harry\\'s head, hooting incessantly. Ron snatched Pigwidgeon out of the air and held him still while Harry attached the letter to his leg.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous, how could they be?\" Ron went on as he carried Pigwidgeon to the window. \"You know what!\\n\\nI reckon you could win this tournament, Harry, I\\'m serious.\"\\n\\nHarry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior of the last few weeks, but he appreciated it all the same. Hermione, however, leaned against the Owlery wall, folded her arms, and frowned at Ron.\\n\\n\"Harry\\'s got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament,\" she said seriously. \"If that was the first task, I hate to think what\\'s coming next.\"\\n\\n\"Right little ray of sunshine, aren\\'t you?\" said Ron. \"You and Professor Trelawney should get together sometime.\"\\n\\nHe threw Pigwidgeon out of the window. Pigwidgeon plummeted twelve feet before managing to pull himself back up again; the letter attached to his leg was much longer and heavier than usual � Harry hadn\\'t been able to resist giving Sirius a blow�by�blow account of exactly how he had swerved, circled, and dodged the Horntail. They watched Pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness, and then Ron said, \"Well, we\\'d better get downstairs for your surprise party, Harry � Fred and George should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now.\"\\n\\nSure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor common room it exploded with cheers and yells again. There were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface; Lee Jordan had let off some Filibuster\\'s Fireworks, so that the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean Thomas, who\\n\\nwas very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new banners, most of which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail\\'s head on his Firebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his head on fire.\\n\\nHarry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione. He couldn\\'t believe how happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he\\'d gotten through the first task, and he wouldn\\'t have to face the second one for three months.\\n\\n\"Blimey, this is heavy,\" said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands. \"Open it, Harry, go on! Let\\'s just see what\\'s inside it!\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s supposed to work out the clue on his own,\" Hermione said swiftly. \"It\\'s in the tournament rules. . . .\"\\n\\n\"I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too,\" Harry muttered, so only Hermione could hear him, and she grinned rather guiltily.\\n\\n\"Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!\" several people echoed.\\n\\nLee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open.\\n\\nIt was hollow and completely empty � but the moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room. The nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick\\'s deathday party, who had all been playing the musical saw.\\n\\n\"Shut it!\" Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.\\n\\n\"What was that?\" said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry slammed it shut again. \"Sounded like a banshee ... Maybe you\\'ve got to get past one of those next, Harry!\"\\n\\n\"It was someone being tortured!\" said Neville, who had gone very white and spilled sausage rolls all over the floor. \"You\\'re going to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be a prat, Neville, that\\'s illegal,\" said George. \"They wouldn\\'t use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions. I thought it sounded a bit like Percy singing . ..\\n\\nmaybe you\\'ve got to attack him while he\\'s in the shower. Harry.\"\\n\\n\"Want a jam tart, Hermione?\" said Fred.\\n\\nHermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her. Fred grinned.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right,\" he said. \"I haven\\'t done anything to them. It\\'s the custard creams you\\'ve got to watch �\"\\n\\nNeville, who had just bitten into a custard cream, choked and spat it out. Fred\\n\\nlaughed.\\n\\n\"Just my little joke, Neville.. . .\"\\n\\nHermione took a jam tart. Then she said, \"Did you get all this from the kitchens, Fred?\"\\n\\n\"Yep,\" said Fred, grinning at her. He put on a high�pitched squeak and imitated a house�elf. \"\\'Anything we can get you, sir, anything at all!\\' They\\'re dead helpful...\\n\\nget me a roast ox if I said I was peckish.\"\\n\\n\"How do you get in there?\" Hermione said in an innocently casual sort of voice.\\n\\n\"Easy,\" said Fred, \"concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit. Just tickle the pear, and it giggles and �\" He stopped and looked suspiciously at her. \"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" said Hermione quickly.\\n\\n\"Going to try and lead the house�elves out on strike now, are you?\" said George.\\n\\n\"Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion?\"\\n\\nSeveral people chortled. Hermione didn\\'t answer.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you go upsetting them and telling them they\\'ve got to take clothes and salaries!\" said Fred warningly. \"You\\'ll put them off their cooking!\"\\n\\nJust then, Neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a large canary.\\n\\n\"Oh � sorry, Neville!\" Fred shouted over all the laughter. \"I forgot � it was the custard creams we hexed �\"\\n\\nWithin a minute, however, Neville had molted, and once his feathers had fallen off, he reappeared looking entirely normal. He even joined in laughing.\\n\\n\"Canary Creams!\" Fred shouted to the excitable crowd. \"George and I invented them � seven Sickles each, a bargain!\"\\n\\nIt was nearly one in the morning when Harry finally went up to the dormitory with Ron, Neville, Seamus, and Dean. Before he pulled the curtains of his four�poster shut. Harry set his tiny model of the Hungarian Horntail on the table next to his bed, where it yawned, curled up, and closed its eyes. Really, Harry thought, as he pulled the hangings on his four�poster closed, Hagrid had a point.. . they were all right, really, dragons. . . .\\n\\nThe start of December brought wind and sleet to Hogwarts. Drafty though the castle always was in winter. Harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake, which was pitching in the high winds, its black sails billowing\\n\\nagainst the dark skies. He thought the Beauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty chilly too. Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping Madame Maxime\\'s horses well provided with their preferred drink of single�malt whiskey; the fumes wafting from the trough in the comer of their paddock was enough to make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class light�headed. This was unhelpful, as they were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about them.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not sure whether they hibernate or not,\" Hagrid told the shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson. \"Thought we\\'d jus\\' try an see if they fancied a kip . . . we\\'ll jus\\' settle \\'em down in these boxes. . . .\"\\n\\nThere were now only ten skrewts left; apparently their desire to kill one another had not been exercised out of them. Each of them was now approaching six feet in length. Their thick gray armor; their powerful, scuttling legs; their fire�blasting ends; their stings and their suckers, combined to make the skrewts the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen. The class looked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes Hagrid had brought out, all lined with pillows and fluffy blankets.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll jus\\' lead \\'em in here,\" Hagrid said, \"an\\' put the lids on, and we\\'ll see what happens.\"\\n\\nBut the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and did not appreciate being forced into pillow�lined boxes and nailed in. Hagrid was soon yelling, \"Don panic, now, don\\' panic!\" while the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin patch, now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes. Most of the class � Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle in the lead � had fled into Hagrid\\'s cabin through the back door and barricaded themselves in; Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were among those who remained outside trying to help Hagrid. Together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts, though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts; finally, only one skrewt was left.\\n\\n\"Don\\' frighten him, now!\" Hagrid shouted as Ron and Harry used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back. \"Jus\\' try an slip the rope \\'round his sting, so he won hurt any o\\' the others!\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, we wouldn\\'t want that!\" Ron shouted angrily as he and Harry backed into the wall of Hagrid\\'s cabin, still holding the skrewt off with their sparks.\\n\\n\"Well, well, well. . . this does look like fun.\"\\n\\nRita Skeeter was leaning on Hagrid\\'s garden fence, looking in at the mayhem. She was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today, and her crocodile�skin handbag was over her arm.\\n\\nHagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering Harry and Ron and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of its end, withering the pumpkin plants nearby.\\n\\n\"Who\\'re you?\" Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope around the skrewt\\'s sting and tightened it.\\n\\n\"Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter,\" Rita replied, beaming at him. Her gold teeth glinted.\\n\\n\"Thought Dumbledore said you weren\\' allowed inside the school anymore,\" said Hagrid, frowning slightly as he got off the slightly squashed skrewt and started tugging it over to its fellows.\\n\\nRita acted as though she hadn\\'t heard what Hagrid had said.\\n\\n\"What are these fascinating creatures called?\" she asked, beaming still more widely.\\n\\n\"Blast�Ended Skrewts,\" grunted Hagrid.\\n\\n\"Really?\" said Rita, apparently full of lively interest. \"I\\'ve never heard of them before...where do they come from?\"\\n\\nHarry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of Hagrid\\'s wild black beard, and his heart sank. Where had Hagrid got the skrewts from? Hermione, who seemed to be thinking along these lines, said quickly, \"They\\'re very interesting, aren\\'t they!\\n\\nAren\\'t they. Harry?\"\\n\\n\"What? Oh yeah . . . ouch . . . interesting,\" said Harry as she stepped on his foot.\\n\\n\"Ah, you\\'re here. Harry!\" said Rita Skeeter as she looked around. \"So you like Care of Magical Creatures, do you? One of your favorite lessons?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry stoutly. Hagrid beamed at him.\\n\\n\"Lovely,\" said Rita. \"Really lovely. Been teaching long?\" she added to Hagrid.\\n\\nHarry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut across one cheek).\\n\\nLavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where most of the class stood, their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear.\\n\\n\"This is o\\'ny me second year,\" said Hagrid.\\n\\n\"Lovely... I don\\'t suppose you\\'d like to give an interview, would you? Share some of your experience of magical creatures? The Prophet does a zoological column every Wednesday, as I\\'m sure you know. We could feature these � er � Bang� Ended Scoots.\"\\n\\n\"Blast�Ended Skrewts,\" Hagrid said eagerly. \"Er � yeah, why not?\"\\n\\nHarry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of communicating it to Hagrid without Rita Skeeter seeing, so he had to stand and watch in silence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for\\n\\na good long interview later that week. Then the bell rang up at the castle, signaling the end of the lesson.\\n\\n\"Well, good�bye, Harry!\" Rita Skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with Ron and Hermione. \"Until Friday night, then, Hagrid!\"\\n\\n\"She\\'ll twist everything he says,\" Harry said under his breath.\\n\\n\"Just as long as he didn\\'t import those skrewts illegally or anything,\" said Hermione desperately. They looked at one another � it was exactly the sort of thing Hagrid might do.\\n\\n\"Hagrids been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledores never sacked him,\"\\n\\nsaid Ron consolingly. \"Worst that can happen is Hagrid\\'ll have to get rid of the skrewts. Sorry . . . did I say worst? I meant best.\"\\n\\nHarry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly more cheerful, went off to lunch.\\n\\nHarry thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that afternoon; they were still doing star charts and predictions, but now that he and Ron were friends once more, the whole thing seemed very funny again. Professor Trelawney, who had been so pleased with the pair of them when they had been predicting their own horrific deaths, quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her explanation of the various ways in which Pluto could disrupt everyday life.\\n\\n\"I would think,\" she said, in a mystical whisper that did not conceal her obvious annoyance, \"that some of us\" � she stared very meaningfully at Harry� \"might be a little less frivolous had they seen what I have seen during my crystal gazing last night. As I sat here, absorbed in my needlework, the urge to consult the orb overpowered me. I arose, I settled myself before it, and I gazed into its crystalline depths . . . and what do you think I saw gazing back at me?\"\\n\\n\"An ugly old bat in outsize specs?\" Ron muttered under his breath.\\n\\nHarry fought hard to keep his face straight.\\n\\n\"Death, my dears.\"\\n\\nParvati and Lavender both put their hands over their mouths, looking horrified.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Professor Trelawney, nodding impressively, \"it comes, ever closer, it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower. . . ever lower over the castle. . . .\"\\n\\nShe stared pointedly at Harry, who yawned very widely and obviously.\\n\\n\"It\\'d be a bit more impressive if she hadn\\'t done it about eighty times before,\"\\n\\nHarry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the staircase beneath Professor Trelawney\\'s room. \"But if I\\'d dropped dead every time she\\'s told me I\\'m going to, I\\'d be a medical miracle.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'d be a sort of extra�concentrated ghost,\" said Ron, chortling, as they passed the Bloody Baron going in the opposite direction, his wide eyes staring sinisterly.\\n\\n\"At least we didn\\'t get homework. I hope Hermione got loads off Professor Vector, I love not working when she is. . . .\"\\n\\nBut Hermione wasn\\'t at dinner, nor was she in the library when they went to look for her afterward. The only person in there was Viktor Krum. Ron hovered behind the bookshelves for a while, watching Krum, debating in whispers with Harry whether he should ask for an autograph � but then Ron realized that six or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books, debating exactly the same thing, and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea.\\n\\n\"Wonder where she\\'s got to?\" Ron said as he and Harry went back to Gryffindor Tower.\\n\\n\"Dunno . . . balderdash.\"\\n\\nBut the Fat Lady had barely begun to swing forward when the sound of racing feet behind them announced Hermione\\'s arrival.\\n\\n\"Harry!\" she panted, skidding to a halt beside him (the Fat Lady stared down at her, eyebrows raised). \"Harry, you\\'ve got to come � you\\'ve got to come, the most amazing thing\\'s happened� please �\"\\n\\nShe seized Harry\\'s arm and started to try to drag him back along the corridor.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" Harry said.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll show you when we get there � oh come on, quick �\"\\n\\nHarry looked around at Ron; he looked back at Harry, intrigued.\\n\\n\"Okay,\" Harry said, starting off back down the corridor with Hermione, Ron hurrying to keep up.\\n\\n\"Oh don\\'t mind me!\" the Fat Lady called irritably after them. \"Don\\'t apologize for bothering me! I\\'ll just hang here, wide open, until you get back, shall I?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, thanks!\" Ron shouted over his shoulder.\\n\\n\"Hermione, where are we going?\" Harry asked, after she had led them down through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hall.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll see, you\\'ll see in a minute!\" said Hermione excitedly.\\n\\nShe turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had regurgitated his and Harry\\'s names. Harry had never been through here before. He and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of ending up in a\\n\\ngloomy underground passage like the one that led to Snape\\'s dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of food.\\n\\n\"Oh hang on . . .\" said Harry slowly, halfway down the corridor. \"Wait a minute, Hermione. . . .\"\\n\\n\"What?\" She turned around to look at him, anticipation all over her face.\\n\\n\"I know what this is about,\" said Harry.\\n\\nHe nudged Ron and pointed to the painting just behind Hermione. It showed a gigantic silver fruit bowl.\\n\\n\"Hermione!\" said Ron, cottoning on. \"You\\'re trying to rope us into that spew stuff again!\"\\n\\n\"No, no, I\\'m not!\" she said hastily. \"And it\\'s not spew, Ron �\"\\n\\n\"Changed the name, have you?\" said Ron, frowning at her. \"What are we now, then, the House�Elf Liberation Front? I\\'m not barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work, I\\'m not doing it �\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not asking you to!\" Hermione said impatiently. \"I came down here just now, to talk to them all, and I found � oh come on, Harry, I want to show you!\"\\n\\nShe seized his arm again, pulled him in front of the picture of the giant fruit bowl, stretched out her forefinger, and tickled the huge green pear. It began to squirm, chuckling, and suddenly turned into a large green door handle. Hermione seized it, pulled the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back, forcing him inside.\\n\\nHe had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high�ceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room, squealing, \"Harry Potter, sir!\\n\\nHarry Potter!\"\\n\\nNext second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break.\\n\\n\"D�Dobby?\" Harry gasped.\\n\\n\"It is Dobby, sir, it is!\" squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel.\\n\\n\"Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!\"\\n\\nDobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his enormous, green, tennis�ball�shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness. He looked almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil�shaped nose, the batlike ears, the long fingers and feet � all except the clothes, which were very different.\\n\\nWhen Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn the same filthy old pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments Harry had ever seen; he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the World Cup. He was wearing a tea cozy for a hat, on which he had pinned a number of bright badges; a tie patterned with horseshoes over a bare chest, a pair of what looked like children\\'s soccer shorts, and odd socks. One of these, Harry saw, was the black one Harry had removed from his own foot and tricked Mr. Malfoy into giving Dobby, thereby setting Dobby free. The other was covered in pink and orange stripes.\\n\\n\"Dobby, what\\'re you doing here?\" Harry said in amazement. \"Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts, sir!\" Dobby squealed excitedly. \"Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky jobs, sir!\\n\\n\"Winky?\" said Harry. \"She\\'s here too?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, yes!\" said Dobby, and he seized Harry\\'s hand and pulled him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there. Each of these tables, Harry noticed as he passed them, was positioned exactly beneath the four House tables above, in the Great Hall. At the moment, they were clear of food, dinner having finished, but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above.\\n\\nAt least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen, beaming, bowing, and curtsying as Dobby led Harry past them. They were all wearing the same uniform: a tea towel stamped with the Hogwarts crest, and tied, as Winky\\'s had been, like a toga.\\n\\nDobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed.\\n\\n\"Winky, sir!\" he said.\\n\\nWinky was sitting on a stool by the fire. Unlike Dobby, she had obviously not foraged for clothes. She was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a matching blue hat, which had holes in it for her large ears. However, while every one of Dobby\\'s strange collection of garments was so clean and well cared for that it looked brand�new, Winky was plainly not taking care other clothes at all. There were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt.\\n\\n\"Hello, Winky,\" said Harry.\\n\\nWinky\\'s lip quivered. Then she burst into tears, which spilled out of her great brown eyes and splashed down her front, just as they had done at the Quidditch World Cup.\\n\\n\"Oh dear,\" said Hermione. She and Ron had followed Harry and Dobby to the end of the kitchen. \"Winky, don\\'t cry, please don\\'t...\"\\n\\nBut Winky cried harder than ever. Dobby, on the other hand, beamed up at Harry.\\n\\n\"Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea?\" he squeaked loudly, over Winky\\'s sobs.\\n\\n\"Er � yeah, okay,\" said Harry.\\n\\nInstantly, about six house�elves came trotting up behind him, bearing a large silver tray laden with a teapot, cups for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a milk jug, and a large plate of biscuits.\\n\\n\"Good service!\" Ron said, in an impressed voice. Hermione frowned at him, but the elves all looked delighted; they bowed very low and retreated.\\n\\n\"How long have you been here, Dobby?\" Harry asked as Dobby handed around the tea.\\n\\n\"Only a week. Harry Potter, sir!\" said Dobby happily. \"Dobby came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir. You see, sir, it is very difficult for a house�elf who has been dismissed to get a new position, sir, very difficult indeed �\"\\n\\nAt this, Winky howled even harder, her squashed�tomato of a nose dribbling all down her front, though she made no effort to stem the flow.\\n\\n\"Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years, sir, trying to find work!\"\\n\\nDobby squeaked. \"But Dobby hasn\\'t found work, sir, because Dobby wants paying now!\"\\n\\nThe house�elves all around the kitchen, who had been listening and watching with interest, all looked away at these words, as though Dobby had said something rude and embarrassing. Hermione, however, said, \"Good for you, Dobby!\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, miss!\" said Dobby, grinning toothily at her. \"But most wizards doesn\\'t want a house�elf who wants paying, miss. \\'That\\'s not the point of a house� elf,\\' they says, and they slammed the door in Dobby\\'s face! Dobby likes work, but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid. Harry Potter.... Dobby likes being free!\"\\n\\nThe Hogwarts house�elves had now started edging away from Dobby, as though he were carrying something contagious. Winky, however, remained where she was, though there was a definite increase in the volume other crying.\\n\\n\"And then, Harry Potter, Dobby goes to visit Winky, and finds out Winky has been freed too, sir!\" said Dobby delightedly.\\n\\nAt this, Winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay face�down on the flagged stone floor, beating her tiny fists upon it and positively screaming with misery. Hermione hastily dropped down to her knees beside her and tried to comfort her, but nothing she said made the slightest difference. Dobby continued with his story, shouting shrilly over Winky\\'s screeches.\\n\\n\"And then Dobby had the idea. Harry Potter, sir! \\'Why doesn\\'t Dobby and Winky find work together?\\' Dobby says. \\'Where is there enough work for two house�\\n\\nelves?\\' says Winky. And Dobby thinks, and it comes to him, sir! Hogwarts! So Dobby and Winky came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir, and Professor Dumbledore took us on!\"\\n\\nDobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled in his eyes again.\\n\\n\"And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby, sir, if Dobby wants paying!\\n\\nAnd so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not very much!\" Hermione shouted indignantly from the floor, over Winky\\'s continued screaming and fist�beating.\\n\\n\"Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends off,\"\\n\\nsaid Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as though the prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening, \"but Dobby beat him down, miss. . . . Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he isn\\'t wanting too much, miss, he likes work better.\"\\n\\n\"And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you, Winky?\" Hermione asked kindly.\\n\\nIf she had thought this would cheer up Winky, she was wildly mistaken. Winky did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her massive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furious.\\n\\n\"Winky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting paid!\" she squeaked.\\n\\n\"Winky is not sunk so low as that! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed!\"\\n\\n\"Ashamed?\" said Hermione blankly. \"But � Winky, come on! It\\'s Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed, not you! You didn\\'t do anything wrong, he was really horrible to you �\"\\n\\nBut at these words, Winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat, flattening her ears so that she couldn\\'t hear a word, and screeched, \"You is not insulting my master, miss! You is not insulting Mr. Crouch! Mr. Crouch is a good wizard, miss!\\n\\nMr. Crouch is right to sack bad Winky!\"\\n\\n\"Winky is having trouble adjusting, Harry Potter,\" squeaked Dobby confidentially.\\n\\n\"Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr. Crouch anymore; she is allowed to speak her mind now, but she won\\'t do it.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t house�elves speak their minds about their masters, then?\" Harry asked.\\n\\n\"Oh no, sir, no,\" said Dobby, looking suddenly serious. \"\\'Tis part of the house�elf\\'s enslavement, sir. We keeps their secrets and our silence, sir. We upholds the family\\'s honor, and we never speaks ill of them � though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he does not insist upon this. Professor Dumbledore said we is free to � to�\"\\n\\nDobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry closer. Harry bent forward.\\n\\nDobby whispered, \"He said we is free to call him a � a barmy old codger if we likes, sir!\"\\n\\nDobby gave a frightened sort of giggle.\\n\\n\"But Dobby is not wanting to, Harry Potter,\" he said, talking normally again, and shaking his head so that his ears flapped. \"Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore very much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him.\"\\n\\n\"But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now?\" Harry asked him, grinning.\\n\\nA slightly fearful look came into Dobby\\'s immense eyes.\\n\\n\"Dobby � Dobby could,\" he said doubtfully. He squared his small shoulders.\\n\\n\"Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were � were � bad Dark wizards\\'.\"\\n\\nDobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror�struck by his own daring � then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard, squealing, \"Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!\"\\n\\nHarry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the table.\\n\\n\"Thank you. Harry Potter, thank you,\" said Dobby breathlessly, rubbing his head.\\n\\n\"You just need a bit of practice,\" Harry said.\\n\\n\"Practice!\" squealed Winky furiously. \"You is ought to be ashamed of yourself, Dobby, talking that way about your masters!\"\\n\\n\"They isn\\'t my masters anymore, Winky!\" said Dobby defiantly. \"Dobby doesn\\'t care what they think anymore!\"\\n\\n\"Oh you is a bad elf, Dobby!\" moaned Winky, tears leaking down her face once more. \"My poor Mr. Crouch, what is he doing without Winky? He is needing me, he is needing my help! I is looking after the Crouches all my life, and my mother is doing it before me, and my grandmother is doing it before her ... oh what is they saying if they knew Winky was freed? Oh the shame, the shame!\" She buried her face in her skirt again and bawled.\\n\\n\"Winky,\" said Hermione firmly, \"I\\'m quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you. We\\'ve seen him, you know �\"\\n\\n\"You is seeing my master?\" said Winky breathlessly, raising her tearstained face out of her skirt once more and goggling at Hermione. \"You is seeing him here at Hogwarts?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Hermione, \"he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard Tournament.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Bagman comes too?\" squeaked Winky, and to Harry \\'s great surprise (and Ron\\'s and Hermione\\'s too, by the looks on their faces), she looked angry again.\\n\\n\"Mr. Bagman is a bad wizard! A very bad wizard! My master isn\\'t liking him, oh no, not at all!\"\\n\\n\"Bagman � bad?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Oh yes,\" Winky said, nodding her head furiously, \"My master is telling Winky some things! But Winky is not saying.. . Winky � Winky keeps her master\\'s secrets. ...\"\\n\\nShe dissolved yet again in tears; they could hear her sobbing into her skirt, \"Poor master, poor master, no Winky to help him no more!\"\\n\\nThey couldn\\'t get another sensible word out of Winky. They left her to her crying and finished their tea, while Dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf and his plans for his wages.\\n\\n\"Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!\" he said happily, pointing at his bare chest, \"Tell you what, Dobby,\" said Ron, who seemed to have taken a great liking to the elf, \"I\\'ll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas, I always get one from her. You don\\'t mind maroon, do you?\"\\n\\nDobby was delighted.\\n\\n\"We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you,\" Ron told him, \"but it\\'ll go well with your tea cozy.\"\\n\\nAs they prepared to take their leave, many of the surrounding elves pressed in upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs. Hermione refused, with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying, but Harry and Ron loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies.\\n\\n\"Thanks a lot!\" Harry said to the elves, who had all clustered around the door to say good night. \"See you, Dobby!\"\\n\\n\"Harry Potter . . . can Dobby come and see you sometimes, sir?\" Dobby asked tentatively.\\n\\n\" \\'Course you can,\" said Harry, and Dobby beamed.\\n\\n\"You know what?\" said Ron, once he, Hermione, and Harry had left the kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again. \"All these years I\\'ve been really impressed with Fred and George, nicking food from the kitchens � well, it\\'s not exactly difficult, is it? They can\\'t wait to give it away!\"\\n\\n\"I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves, you know,\"\\n\\nsaid Hermione, leading the way back up the marble staircase. \"Dobby coming to\\n\\nwork here, I mean. The other elves will see how happy he is, being free, and slowly it\\'ll dawn on them that they want that too!\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s hope they don\\'t look too closely at Winky,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Oh she\\'ll cheer up,\" said Hermione, though she sounded a bit doubtful. \"Once the shock\\'s worn off, and she\\'s got used to Hogwarts, she\\'ll see how much better off she is without that Crouch man.\"\\n\\n\"She seems to love him,\" said Ron thickly (he had just started on a cream cake).\\n\\n\"Doesn\\'t think much of Bagman, though, does she?\" said Harry. \"Wonder what Crouch says at home about him?\"\\n\\n\"Probably says he\\'s not a very good Head of Department,\" said Hermione, \"and let\\'s face it... he\\'s got a point, hasn\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d still rather work for him than old Crouch,\" said Ron. \"At least Bagman\\'s got a sense of humor.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t let Percy hear you saying that,\" Hermione said, smiling slightly.\\n\\n\"Yeah, well, Percy wouldn\\'t want to work for anyone with a sense of humor, would he?\" said Ron, now starting on a chocolate eclair. \"Percy wouldn\\'t recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby\\'s tea cozy.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY�TWO � THE UNEXPECTED TASK\\n\\nPotter! Weasley! Will you pay attention?\"\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall\\'s irritated voice cracked like a whip through the Transfiguration class on Thursday, and Harry and Ron both jumped and looked up.\\n\\nIt was the end of the lesson; they had finished their work; the guinea fowl they had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on Professor McGonagall\\'s desk (Neville\\'s still had feathers); they had copied down their homework from the blackboard (\"Describe, with examples, the ways in which Transforming Spells must be adapted when performing Cross�Species Switches\"}.\\n\\nThe bell was due to ring at any moment, and Harry and Ron, who had been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George\\'s fake wands at the back of the class, looked up, Ron holding a tin parrot and Harry, a rubber haddock.\\n\\n\"Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age,\" said Professor McGonagall, with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of Harry\\'s haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor � Ron\\'s parrot\\'s beak had severed it moments before � \"I have something to say to you all.\\n\\n\"The Yule Ball is approaching � a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and an opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign guests. Now, the ball will be open only to fourth years and above � although you may invite a younger student if you wish �\"\\n\\nLavender Brown let out a shrill giggle. Parvati Patil nudged her hard in the ribs, her face working furiously as she too fought not to giggle. They both looked around at Harry, Professor McGonagall ignored them, which Harry thought was distinctly unfair, as she had just told off him and Ron.\\n\\n\"Dress robes will be worn,\" Professor McGonagall continued, \"and the ball will start at eight o\\'clock on Christmas Day, finishing at midnight in the Great Hall.\\n\\nNow then �\"\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall stared deliberately around the class.\\n\\n\"The Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to � er � let our hair down,\" she said, in a disapproving voice.\\n\\nLavender giggled harder than ever, with her hand pressed hard against her mouth to stifle the sound. Harry could see what was funny this time: Professor McGonagall, with her hair in a tight bun, looked as though she had never let her hair down in any sense.\\n\\n\"But that does NOT mean,\" Professor McGonagall went on, \"that we will be\\n\\nrelaxing the standards of behavior we expect from Hogwarts students. I will be most seriously displeased if a Gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any way.\"\\n\\nThe bell rang, and there was the usual scuffle of activity as everyone packed their bags and swung them onto their shoulders.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall called above the noise, \"Potter � a word, if you please.\"\\n\\nAssuming this had something to do with his headless rubber haddock, Harry proceeded gloomily to the teacher\\'s desk. Professor McGonagall waited until the rest of the class had gone, and then said, \"Potter, the champions and their partners �\"\\n\\n\"What partners?\" said Harry.\\n\\nProfesor McGonagall looked suspiciously at him, as though she thought he was trying to be funny.\\n\\n\"Your partners for the Yule Ball, Potter,\" she said coldly. \"Your dance partners.\"\\n\\nHarry\\'s insides seemed to curl up and shrivel.\\n\\n\"Dance partners?\" He felt himself going red. \"I don\\'t dance,\" he said quickly.\\n\\n\"Oh yes, you do,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"That\\'s what I\\'m telling you. Traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball.\"\\n\\nHarry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and tails, accompanied by a girl in the sort of frilly dress Aunt Petunia always wore to Uncle Vernon\\'s work parties.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not dancing,\" he said.\\n\\n\"It is traditional,\" said Professor McGonagall firmly. \"You are a Hogwarts champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school. So make sure you get yourself a partner, Potter.\"\\n\\n\"But�I don\\'t�\"\\n\\n\"You heard me, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall in a very final sort of way.\\n\\nA week ago. Harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a cinch compared to taking on a Hungarian Horntail. But now that he had done the latter, and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball, he thought he\\'d rather have another round with the dragon.\\n\\nHarry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas; he always did, of course, because the alternative was usually going back to Privet Drive, but he had always been very much in the minority before now. This year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above\\n\\nseemed to be staying, and they all seemed to Harry to be obsessed with the coming ball � or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how many girls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never quite noticed that before. Girls giggling and whispering in the corridors, girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to wear on Christmas night... .\\n\\n\"Why do they have to move in packs?\" Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them, sniggering and staring at Harry. \"How\\'re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?\"\\n\\n\"Lasso one?\" Ron suggested. \"Got any idea who you\\'re going to try?\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t answer. He knew perfectly well whom he\\'d like to ask, but working up the nerve was something else. . . . Cho was a year older than he was; she was very pretty; she was a very good Quidditch player, and she was also very popular.\\n\\nRon seemed to know what was going on inside Harry\\'s head.\\n\\n\"Listen, you\\'re not going to have any trouble. You\\'re a champion. You\\'ve just beaten a Hungarian Horntail. I bet they\\'ll be queuing up to go with you.\"\\n\\nIn tribute to their recently repaired friendship, Ron had kept the bitterness in his voice to a bare minimum. Moreover, to Harry\\'s amazement, he turned out to be quite right.\\n\\nA curly�haired third�year Hufflepuff girl to whom Harry had never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day. Harry was so taken aback he said no before he\\'d even stopped to consider the matter. The girl walked off looking rather hurt, and Harry had to endure Dean\\'s, Seamus\\'s, and Ron\\'s taunts about her all through History of Magic. The following day, two more girls asked him, a second year and (to his horror) a fifth year who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused.\\n\\n\"She was quite good�looking,\" said Ron fairly, after he\\'d stopped laughing.\\n\\n\"She was a foot taller than me,\" said Harry, still unnerved. \"Imagine what I\\'d look like trying to dance with her.\"\\n\\nHermione\\'s words about Krum kept coming back to him. \"They only like him because he\\'s famous!\" Harry doubted very much if any of the girls who had asked to be his partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with him if he hadn\\'t been a school champion. Then he wondered if this would bother him if Cho asked him.\\n\\nOn the whole. Harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him, life had definitely improved since he had got through the first task. He wasn\\'t attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore, which he suspected had a lot to do with Cedric � he had an idea Cedric\\n\\nmight have told the Hufflepuffs to leave Harry alone, in gratitude for Harry\\'s tip� off about the dragons. There seemed to be fewer Support Cedric Diggory! badges around too. Draco Malfoy, of course, was still quoting Rita Skeeter\\'s article to him at every possible opportunity, but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it � and just to heighten Harry\\'s feeling of well�being, no story about Hagrid had appeared in the Daily Prophet.\\n\\n\"She didn\\' seem very int\\'rested in magical creatures, ter tell yeh the truth,\" Hagrid said, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione asked him how his interview with Rita Skeeter had gone during the last Care of Magical Creatures lesson of the term. To their very great relief, Hagrid had given up on direct contact with the skrewts now, and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today, sitting at a trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to tempt the skrewts.\\n\\n\"She jus\\' wanted me ter talk about you, Harry,\" Hagrid continued in a low voice.\\n\\n\"Well, I told her we\\'d been friends since I went ter fetch yeh from the Dursleys.\\n\\n\\'Never had to tell him off in four years?\\' she said. \\'Never played you up in lessons, has he?\\' I told her no, an she didn\\' seem happy at all. Yeh\\'d think she wanted me to say yeh were horrible, Harry.\"\\n\\n\" \\'Course she did,\" said Harry, throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more. \"She can\\'t keep writing about what a tragic little hero I am, it\\'ll get boring.\"\\n\\n\"She wants a new angle, Hagrid,\" said Ron wisely as he shelled salamander eggs.\\n\\n\"You were supposed to say Harry\\'s a mad delinquent!\"\\n\\n\"But he\\'s not!\" said Hagrid, looking genuinely shocked.\\n\\n\"She should\\'ve interviewed Snape,\" said Harry grimly. \"He\\'d give her the goods on me any day. \\'Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school. . . .\\'�\\n\\n\"Said that, did he?\" said Hagrid, while Ron and Hermione laughed. \"Well, yeh might\\'ve bent a few rules. Harry, bu\\' yeh\\'re all righ\\' really, aren\\' you?\"\\n\\n\"Cheers, Hagrid,\" said Harry, grinning.\\n\\n\"You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, Hagrid?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Though\\' I might look in on it, yeah,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"Should be a good do, I reckon. You\\'ll be openin the dancin\\', won yeh, Harry? Who\\'re you takin\\'?\"\\n\\n\"No one, yet,\" said Harry, feeling himself going red again. Hagrid didn\\'t pursue the subject.\\n\\nThe last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed. Rumors about the Yule Ball were flying everywhere, though Harry didn\\'t believe half of them � for instance, that Dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from Madam Rosmerta. It seemed to be fact, however, that he had booked\\n\\nthe Weird Sisters. Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters were Harry didn\\'t know, never having had access to a wizard\\'s wireless, but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless Network) that they were a very famous musical group.\\n\\nSome of the teachers, like little Professor Flitwick, gave up trying to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere; he allowed them to play games in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent most of it talking to Harry about the perfect Summoning Charm Harry had used during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. Other teachers were not so generous. Nothing would ever deflect Professor Binns, for example, from plowing on through his notes on goblin rebellions � as Binns hadn\\'t let his own death stand in the way of continuing to teach, they supposed a small thing like Christmas wasn\\'t going to put him off. It was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as Percys cauldron�bottom report. Professors McGonagall and Moody kept them working until the very last second of their classes too, and Snape, of course, would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt Harry. Staring nastily around at them all, he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the term.\\n\\n\"Evil, he is,\" Ron said bitterly that night in the Gryffindor common room.\\n\\n\"Springing a test on us on the last day. Ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studying.\"\\n\\n\"Mmm . . . you\\'re not exactly straining yourself, though, are you?\" said Hermione, looking at him over the top of her Potions notes. Ron was busy building a card castle out of his Exploding Snap pack � a much more interesting pastime than with Muggle cards, because of the chance that the whole thing would blow up at any second.\\n\\n\"It\\'s Christmas, Hermione,\" said Harry lazily; he was rereading Flying with the Cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire.\\n\\nHermione looked severely over at him too. \"I\\'d have thought you\\'d be doing something constructive, Harry, even if you don\\'t want to learn your antidotes!\"\\n\\n\"Like what?\" Harry said as he watched Joey Jenkins of the Cannons belt a Bludger toward a Ballycastle Bats Chaser.\\n\\n\"That egg!\" Hermione hissed.\\n\\n\"Come on, Hermione, I\\'ve got till February the twenty�fourth,\" Harry said.\\n\\nHe had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and hadn\\'t opened it since the celebration party after the first task. There were still two and a half months to go until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing meant, after all.\\n\\n\"But it might take weeks to work it out!\" said Hermione. \"You\\'re going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you don\\'t!\"\\n\\n\"Leave him alone, Hermione, he\\'s earned a bit of a break,\" said Ron, and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing his eyebrows.\\n\\n\"Nice look, Ron ... go well with your dress robes, that will.\"\\n\\nIt was Fred and George. They sat down at the table with Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Ron felt how much damage had been done.\\n\\n\"Ron, can we borrow Pigwidgeon?\" George asked.\\n\\n\"No, he\\'s off delivering a letter,\" said Ron. \"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Because George wants to invite him to the ball,\" said Fred sarcastically.\\n\\n\"Because we want to send a letter, you stupid great prat,\" said George.\\n\\n\"Who d\\'you two keep writing to, eh?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Nose out, Ron, or I\\'ll burn that for you too,\" said Fred, waving his wand threateningly. \"So . . . you lot got dates for the ball yet?\"\\n\\n\"Nope,\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'d better hurry up, mate, or all the good ones will be gone,\" said Fred.\\n\\n\"Who\\'re you going with, then?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Angelina,\" said Fred promptly, without a trace of embarrassment.\\n\\n\"What?\" said Ron, taken aback. \"You\\'ve already asked her?\"\\n\\n\"Good point,\" said Fred. He turned his head and called across the common room, \"Oi! Angelina!\"\\n\\nAngelina, who had been chatting with Alicia Spinnet near the fire, looked over at him.\\n\\n\"What?\" she called back.\\n\\n\"Want to come to the ball with me?\"\\n\\nAngelina gave Fred an appraising sort of look.\\n\\n\"All right, then,\" she said, and she turned back to Alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face.\\n\\n\"There you go,\" said Fred to Harry and Ron, \"piece of cake.\"\\n\\nHe got to his feet, yawning, and said, \"We\\'d better use a school owl then, George,\\n\\ncome on. .. .\"\\n\\nThey left. Ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle at Harry.\\n\\n\"We should get a move on, you know . . . ask someone. He\\'s right. We don\\'t want to end up with a pair of trolls.\"\\n\\nHermione let out a sputter of indignation.\\n\\n\"A pair of... what, excuse me?\"\\n\\n\"Well � you know,\" said Ron, shrugging. \"I\\'d rather go alone than with � with Eloise Midgen, say.\"\\n\\n\"Her acne\\'s loads better lately � and she\\'s really nice!\"\\n\\n\"Her nose is off�center,\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Oh I see,\" Hermione said, bristling. \"So basically, you\\'re going to take the best� looking girl who\\'ll have you, even if she\\'s completely horrible?\"\\n\\n\"Er � yeah, that sounds about right,\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to bed,\" Hermione snapped, and she swept off toward the girls\\' staircase without another word.\\n\\nThe Hogwarts staff, demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, seemed determined to show the castle at its best this Christmas. When the decorations went up. Harry noticed that they were the most stunning he had yet seen inside the school. Everlasting icicles had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase; the usual twelve Christmas trees in the Great Hall were bedecked with everything from luminous holly berries to real, hooting, golden owls, and the suits of armor had all been bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them. It was quite something to hear \"0 Come, All Ye Faithful\" sung by an empty helmet that only knew half the words. Several times, Filch the caretaker had to extract Peeves from inside the armor, where he had taken to hiding, filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of his own invention, all of which were very rude.\\n\\nAnd still. Harry hadn\\'t asked Cho to the ball. He and Ron were getting very nervous now, though as Harry pointed out, Ron would look much less stupid than he would without a partner; Harry was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other champions.\\n\\n\"I suppose there\\'s always Moaning Myrtle,\" he said gloomily, referring to the ghost who haunted the girls\\' toilets on the second floor.\\n\\n\"Harry � we\\'ve just got to grit our teeth and do it,\" said Ron on Friday morning, in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress.\\n\\n\"When we get back to the common room tonight, we\\'ll both have partners � agreed?\"\\n\\n\"Er . . . okay,\" said Harry.\\n\\nBut every time he glimpsed Cho that day � during break, and then lunchtime, and once on the way to History of Magic � she was surrounded by friends. Didn\\'t she ever go anywhere alone? Could he perhaps ambush her as she was going into a bathroom? But no � she even seemed to go there with an escort of four or five girls. Yet if he didn\\'t do it soon, she was bound to have been asked by somebody else.\\n\\nHe found it hard to concentrate on Snape\\'s Potions test, and consequently forgot to add the key ingredient � a bezoar � meaning that he received bottom marks. He didn\\'t care, though; he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do. When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and hurried to the dungeon door.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll meet you at dinner,\" he said to Ron and Hermione, and he dashed off upstairs.\\n\\nHe\\'d just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was all. ... He hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her, and (rather sooner than he had expected) he found her, emerging from a Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.\\n\\n\"Er � Cho? Could I have a word with you?\"\\n\\nGiggling should be made illegal. Harry thought furiously, as all the girls around Cho started doing it. She didn\\'t, though. She said, \"Okay,\" and followed him out of earshot other classmates.\\n\\nHarry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs.\\n\\n\"Er,\" he said.\\n\\nHe couldn\\'t ask her. He couldn\\'t. But he had to. Cho stood there looking puzzled, watching him. The words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue around them.\\n\\n\"Wangoballwime?\"\\n\\n\"Sorry?\" said Cho.\\n\\n\"D\\'you � d\\'you want to go to the ball with me?\" said Harry. Why did he have to go red now? Why!\\n\\n\"Oh!\" s aid Cho, and she went red too. \"Oh Harry, I\\'m really sorry,\" and she truly looked it. \"I\\'ve already said I\\'ll go with someone else.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Harry.\\n\\nIt was odd; a moment before his insides had been writhing like snakes, but suddenly he didn\\'t seem to have any insides at all.\\n\\n\"Oh okay,\" he said, \"no problem.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m really sorry,\" she said again.\\n\\n\"That\\'s okay,\" said Harry.\\n\\nThey stood there looking at each other, and then Cho said, \"Well�\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Well, \\'bye,\" said Cho, still very red. She walked away.\\n\\nHarry called after her, before he could stop himself.\\n\\n\"Who\\'re you going with?\"\\n\\n\"Oh � Cedric,\" she said. \"Cedric Diggory.\"\\n\\n\"Oh right,\" said Harry.\\n\\nHis insides had come back again. It felt as though they had been filled with lead in their absence.\\n\\nCompletely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly back up to Gryffindor Tower, Cho\\'s voice echoing in his ears with every step he took. \"Cedric � Cedric Diggory.\" He had been starting to quite like Cedric � prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at Quidditch, and was handsome, and popular, and nearly everyone\\'s favorite champion. Now he suddenly realized that Cedric was in fact a useless pretty boy who didn\\'t have enough brains to fill an eggcup.\\n\\n\"Fairy lights,\" he said dully to the Fat Lady � the password had been changed the previous day.\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed, dear!\" she trilled, straightening her new tinsel hair band as she swung forward to admit him.\\n\\nEntering the common room, Harry looked around, and to his surprise he saw Ron sitting ashen�faced in a distant corner. Ginny was sitting with him, talking to him in what seemed to be a low, soothing voice.\\n\\n\"What\\'s up, Ron?\" said Harry, joining them.\\n\\nRon looked up at Harry, a sort of blind horror in his face.\\n\\n\"Why did I do it?\" he said wildly. \"I don\\'t know what made me do it!\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"He � er � just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him,\" said Ginny. She\\n\\nlooked as though she was fighting back a smile, but she kept patting Ron\\'s arm sympathetically.\\n\\n\"You what?\\' said Harry.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what made me do it!\" Ron gasped again. \"What was I playing at!\\n\\nThere were people � all around � I\\'ve gone mad � everyone watching! I was just walking past her in the entrance hall � she was standing there talking to Diggory � and it sort of came over me � and I asked her!\"\\n\\nRon moaned and put his face in his hands. He kept talking, though the words were barely distinguishable.\\n\\n\"She looked at me like I was a sea slug or something. Didn\\'t even answer. And then � I dunno � I just sort of came to my senses and ran for it.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s part veela,\" said Harry. \"You were right � her grandmother was one. It wasn\\'t your fault, I bet you just walked past when she was turning on the old charm for Diggory and got a blast of it � but she was wasting her time. He\\'s going with Cho Chang.\"\\n\\nRon looked up.\\n\\n\"I asked her to go with me just now,\" Harry said dully, \"and she told me.\"\\n\\nGinny had suddenly stopped smiling.\\n\\n\"This is mad,\" said Ron. \"We\\'re the only ones left who haven\\'t got anyone � well, except Neville. Hey � guess who he asked? Hermione!\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry, completely distracted by this startling news.\\n\\n\"Yeah, I know!\" said Ron, some of the color coming back into his face as he started to laugh. \"He told me after Potions! Said she\\'s always been really nice, helping him out with work and stuff� but she told him she was already going with someone. Ha! As if! She just didn\\'t want to go with Neville ... I mean, who would?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t!\" said Ginny, annoyed. \"Don\\'t laugh �\"\\n\\nJust then Hermione climbed in through the portrait hole.\\n\\n\"Why weren\\'t you two at dinner?\" she said, coming over to join them.\\n\\n\"Because � oh shut up laughing, you two � because they\\'ve both just been turned down by girls they asked to the ball!\" said Ginny.\\n\\nThat shut Harry and Ron up.\\n\\n\"Thanks a bunch, Ginny,\" said Ron sourly.\\n\\n\"All the good�looking ones taken, Ron?\" said Hermione loftily. \"Eloise Midgen\\n\\nstarting to look quite pretty now, is she? Well, I\\'m sure you\\'ll find someone somewhere who\\'ll have you.\"\\n\\nBut Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light.\\n\\n\"Hermione, Neville\\'s right � you are a girl. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Oh well spotted,\" she said acidly.\\n\\n\"Well � you can come with one of us!\"\\n\\n\"No, I can\\'t,\" snapped Hermione.\\n\\n\"Oh come on,\" he said impatiently, \"we need partners, we\\'re going to look really stupid if we haven\\'t got any, everyone else has . . .\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t come with you,\" said Hermione, now blushing, \"because I\\'m already going with someone.\"\\n\\n\"No, you\\'re not!\" said Ron. \"You just said that to get rid of Neville!\"\\n\\n\"Oh did I?\" said Hermione, and her eyes flashed dangerously. \"Just because it\\'s taken you three years to notice, Ron, doesn\\'t mean no one else has spotted I\\'m a girl!\"\\n\\nRon stared at her. Then he grinned again.\\n\\n\"Okay, okay, we know you\\'re a girl,\" he said. \"That do? Will you come now?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve already told you!\" Hermione said very angrily. \"I\\'m going with someone else!\"\\n\\nAnd she stormed off toward the girls\\' dormitories again.\\n\\n\"She\\'s lying,\" said Ron flatly, watching her go.\\n\\n\"She\\'s not,\" said Ginny quietly.\\n\\n\"Who is it then?\" said Ron sharply.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not telling you, it\\'s her business,\" said Ginny.\\n\\n\"Right,\" said Ron, who looked extremely put out, \"this is getting stupid. Ginny, you can go with Harry, and I\\'ll just �\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t,\" said Ginny, and she went scarlet too. \"I\\'m going with � with Neville. He asked me when Hermione said no, and I thought. . . well. . . I\\'m not going to be able to go otherwise, I\\'m not in fourth year.\" She looked extremely miserable. \"I think I\\'ll go and have dinner,\" she said, and she got up and walked off to the portrait hole, her head bowed.\\n\\nRon goggled at Harry.\\n\\n\"What\\'s got into them?\" he demanded.\\n\\nBut Harry had just seen Parvati and Lavender come in through the portrait hole.\\n\\nThe time had come for drastic action.\\n\\n\"Wait here,\" he said to Ron, and he stood up, walked straight up to Parvati, and said, \"Parvati? Will you go to the ball with me?\"\\n\\nParvati went into a fit of giggles. Harry waited for them to subside, his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes.\\n\\n\"Yes, all right then,\" she said finally, blushing furiously.\\n\\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, in relief. \"Lavender � will you go with Ron?\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s going with Seamus,\" said Parvati, and the pair of them giggled harder than ever.\\n\\nHarry sighed.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t you think of anyone who\\'d go with Ron?\" he said, lowering his voice so that Ron wouldn\\'t hear.\\n\\n\"What about Hermione Granger?\" said Parvati.\\n\\n\"She\\'s going with someone else.\"\\n\\nParvati looked astonished.\\n\\n\"Ooooh � who?\" she said keenly.\\n\\nHarry shrugged. \"No idea,\" he said. \"So what about Ron?\"\\n\\n\"Well. . .\" said Parvati slowly, \"I suppose my sister might. . . Padma, you know ...\\n\\nin Ravenclaw. I\\'ll ask her if you like.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, that would be great,\" said Harry. \"Let me know, will you?\"\\n\\nAnd he went back over to Ron, feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble than it was worth, and hoping very much that Padma Patil\\'s nose was dead center.\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY�THREE � THE YULE BALL\\n\\nDespite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had been given for the holidays. Harry was in no mood to work when term ended, and spent the week leading up to Christmas enjoying himself as fully as possible along with everyone else. Gryffindor Tower was hardly less crowded now than during term�time; it seemed to have shrunk slightly too, as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual. Fred and George had had a great success with their Canary Creams, and for the first couple of days of the holidays, people kept bursting into feather all over the place. Before long, however, all the Gryffindors had learned to treat food anybody else offered them with extreme caution, in case it had a Canary Cream concealed in the center, and George confided to Harry that he and Fred were now working on developing something else. Harry made a mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from Fred and George in future. He still hadn\\'t forgotten Dudley and the Ton�Tongue Toffee.\\n\\nSnow was falling thickly upon the castle and its grounds now. The pale blue Beauxbatons carriage looked like a large, chilly, frosted pumpkin next to the iced gingerbread house that was Hagrid\\'s cabin, while the Durmstrang ship\\'s portholes were glazed with ice, the rigging white with frost. The house�elves down in the kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of rich, warming stews and savory puddings, and only Fleur Delacour seemed to be able to find anything to complain about.\\n\\n\"It is too \\'eavy, all zis \\'Ogwarts food,\" they heard her saying grumpily as they left the Great Hall behind her one evening (Ron skulking behind Harry, keen not to be spotted by Fleur). \"I will not fit into my dress robes!\"\\n\\n\"Oooh there\\'s a tragedy,\" Hermione snapped as Fleur went out into the entrance hall. \"She really thinks a lot of herself, that one, doesn\\'t she?\"\\n\\n\"Hermione � who are you going to the ball with?\" said Ron.\\n\\nHe kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it. However, Hermione merely frowned and said, \"I\\'m not telling you, you\\'ll just make fun of me.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re joking, Weasley!\" said Malfoy, behind them. \"You\\'re not telling me someone\\'s asked that to the ball? Not the long�molared Mudblood?\" ; Harry and Ron both whipped around, but Hermione said loudly, waving to somebody over Malfoys shoulder, \"Hello, Professor Moody!\"\\n\\nMalfoy went pale and jumped backward, looking wildly around for Moody, but he was still up at the staff table, finishing his stew.\\n\\n\"Twitchy little ferret, aren\\'t you, Malfoy?\" said Hermione scathingly, and she, Harry, and Ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartily.\\n\\n\"Hermione,\" said Ron, looking sideways at her, suddenly frowning, \"your teeth ...\"\\n\\n\"What about them?\" she said.\\n\\n\"Well, they\\'re different. . . I\\'ve just noticed. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Of course they are � did you expect me to keep those fangs Malfoy gave me?\"\\n\\n\"No, I mean, they\\'re different to how they were before he put that hex on you. . . .\\n\\nThey\\'re all... straight and � and normal�sized.\"\\n\\nHermione suddenly smiled very mischievously, and Harry noticed it too: It was a very different smile from the one he remembered.\\n\\n\"Well. . . when I went up to Madam Pomfrey to get them shrunk, she held up a mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they normally were,\"\\n\\nshe said. \"And I just. . . let her carry on a bit.\" She smiled even more widely.\\n\\n\"Mum and Dad won\\'t be too pleased. I\\'ve been trying to persuade them to let me shrink them for ages, but they wanted me to carry on with my braces. You know, they\\'re dentists, they just don\\'t think teeth and magic should � look! Pigwidgeons back!\"\\n\\nRon\\'s tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the icicle�laden banisters, a scroll of parchment tied to his leg. People passing him were pointing and laughing, and a group of third�year girls paused and said, \"Oh look at the weeny owl! Isn\\'t he cute?\"\\n\\nStupid little feathery git!\" Ron hissed, hurrying up the stairs and snatching up Pigwidgeon. \"You bring letters to the addressee! You don\\'t hang around showing off!\"\\n\\nPigwidgeon hooted happily, his head protruding over Ron\\'s fist. The third�year girls all looked very shocked.\\n\\n\"Clear off!\" Ron snapped at them, waving the fist holding Pigwidgeon, who hooted more happily than ever as he soared through the air. \"Here � take it, Harry,\"\\n\\nRon added in an undertone as the third�year girls scuttled away looking scandalized. He pulled Sirius\\'s reply off Pigwidgeons leg. Harry pocketed it, and they hurried back to Gryffindor Tower to read it.\\n\\nEveryone in the common room was much too busy in letting off more holiday steam to observe what anyone else was up to. Ron, Harry, and Hermione sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually filling up with snow, and Harry read out: Dear Harry,\\n\\nCongratulations on getting past the Horntail. Whoever put your name in that goblet shouldn\\'t be feeling too happy right now! I was going to suggest a Conjunctivitus Curse, as a dragon\\'s eyes are its weakest point � \"That\\'s what Krum did!\" Hermione whispered � but your way was better, I\\'m impressed.\\n\\nDon\\'t get complacent, though. Harry. You\\'ve only done one task; whoever put you in for the tournament\\'s got plenty more opportunity if they\\'re trying to hurt you.\\n\\nKeep your eyes open �particularly when the person we discussed is around and concentrate on keeping yourself out of trouble.\\n\\nKeep in touch, I still want to hear about anything unusual.\\n\\nSirius \"He sounds exactly like Moody,\" said Harry quietly, tucking the letter away again inside his robes. \"\\'Constant vigilance!\\' You\\'d think I walk around with my eyes shut, banging off the walls. ...\"\\n\\n\"But he\\'s right, Harry,\" said Hermione, \"you have still got two tasks to do. You really ought to have a look at that egg, you know, and start working out what it means. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Hermione, he\\'s got ages!\" snapped Ron. \"Want a game of chess, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, okay,\" said Harry. Then, spotting the look on Hermione\\'s face, he said, \"Come on, how\\'m I supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on? I won\\'t even be able to hear the egg over this lot.\"\\n\\n\"Oh I suppose not,\" she sighed, and she sat down to watch their chess match, which culminated in an exciting checkmate of Ron\\'s, involving a couple of recklessly brave pawns and a very violent bishop.\\n\\nHarry awoke very suddenly on Christmas Day. Wondering what had caused his abrupt return to consciousness, he opened his eyes, and saw something with very large, round, green eyes staring back at him in the darkness, so close they were almost nose to nose.\\n\\n\"Dobby!\" Harry yelled, scrambling away from the elf so fast he almost fell out of bed. \"Don\\'t do that!\"\\n\\n\"Dobby is sorry, sir!\" squeaked Dobby anxiously, jumping backward with his long fingers over his mouth. \"Dobby is only wanting to wish Harry Potter \\'Merry Christmas\\' and bring him a present, Sir! Harry Potter did say Dobby could come and see him sometimes, sir!\"\\n\\nIt\\'s okay,\" said Harry, still breathing rather faster than usual, while his heart rate returned to normal. \"Just � just prod me or something in future, all right, don\\'t bend over me like that. ..\"\\n\\nHarry pulled back the curtains around his four�poster, took his glasses from his\\n\\nbedside table, and put them on. His yell had awoken Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville. All of them were peering through the gaps in their own hangings, heavy� eyed and tousle�haired.\\n\\n\"Someone attacking you, Harry?\" Seamus asked sleepily.\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s just Dobby,\" Harry muttered. \"Go back to sleep.\"\\n\\n\"Nah . . . presents!\" said Seamus, spotting the large pile at the foot of his bed. Ron, Dean, and Neville decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some present�opening too. Harry turned back to Dobby, who was now standing nervously next to Harrys bed, still looking worried that he had upset Harry. There was a Christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea cozy.\\n\\n\"Can Dobby give Harry Potter his present?\" he squeaked tentatively.\\n\\n\"\\'Course you can,\" said Harry. \"Er. . . I\\'ve got something for you too.\"\\n\\nIt was a lie; he hadn\\'t bought anything for Dobby at all, but he quickly opened his trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly rolled�up pair of socks. They were his oldest and foulest, mustard yellow, and had once belonged to Uncle Vernon. The reason they were extra�knobbly was that Harry had been using them to cushion his Sneakoscope for over a year now. He pulled out the Sneako�scope and handed the socks to Dobby, saying, \"Sorry, I forgot to wrap them...\"\\n\\nBut Dobby was utterly delighted.\\n\\n\"Socks are Dobby\\'s favorite, favorite clothes, sir!\" he said, ripping off his odd ones and pulling on Uncle Vernon\\'s. \"I has seven now, sir. . . . But sir ...\" he said, his eyes widening, having pulled both socks up to their highest extent, so that they reached to the bottom of his shorts, \"they has made a mistake in the shop, Harry Potter, they is giving you two the same!\"\\n\\n\"Ah, no, Harry, how come you didn\\'t spot that?\" said Ron, grinning over from his own bed, which was now strewn with wrapping paper. \"Tell you what, Dobby � here you go � take these two, and you can mix them up properly. And here\\'s your sweater.\"\\n\\nHe threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped, and the hand� knitted sweater Mrs. Weasley had sent, Dobby looked quite overwhelmed.\\n\\n\"Sir is very kind!\" he squeaked, his eyes brimming with tears again, bowing deeply to Ron. \"Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard, for he is Harry Potter\\'s greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless �\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re only socks,\" said Ron, who had gone slightly pink around the ears, though he looked rather pleased all the same. \"Wow, Harry �\" He had just opened Harry\\'s present, a Chudley Cannon hat. \"Cool!\" He jammed it onto his head, where it clashed horribly with his hair.\\n\\nDobby now handed Harry a small package, which turned out to be � socks.\\n\\n\"Dobby is making them himself, sir!\" the elf said happily. \"He is buying the wool out of his wages, sir!\"\\n\\nThe left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it; the right sock was green with a pattern of Snitches.\\n\\n\"They\\'re . . . they\\'re really . . . well, thanks, Dobby,\" said Harry, and he pulled them on, causing Dobby\\'s eyes to leak with happiness again.\\n\\n\"Dobby must go now, sir, we is already making Christmas dinner in the kitchens!\"\\n\\nsaid Dobby, and he hurried out of the dormitory, waving good�bye to Ron and the others as he passed.\\n\\nHarry\\'s other presents were much more satisfactory than Dobby\\'s odd socks � with the obvious exception of the Dursleys\\', which consisted of a single tissue, an all� time low � Harry supposed they too were remember ing the Ton�Tongue Toffee.\\n\\nHermione had given Harry a book called Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland; Ron, a bulging bag of Dungbombs; Sirius, a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot; and Hagrid, a vast box of sweets including all Harrys favorites: Bertie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Drooble\\'s Best Blowing Gum, and Fizzing Whizbees. There was also, of course, Mrs.\\n\\nWeasley\\'s usual package, including a new sweater (green, with a picture of a dragon on it � Harry supposed Charlie had told her all about the Horntail), and a large quantity of homemade mince pies.\\n\\nHarry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common room, and they went down to breakfast together. They spent most of the morning in Gryffindor Tower, where everyone was enjoying their presents, then returned to the Great Hall for a magnificent lunch, which included at least a hundred turkeys and Christmas puddings, and large piles of Cribbage\\'s Wizarding Crackers.\\n\\nThey went out onto the grounds in the afternoon; the snow was untouched except for the deep channels made by the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle. Hermione chose to watch Harry and the Weasleys\\' snowball fight rather than join in, and at five o\\'clock said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball.\\n\\n\"What, you need three hours?\" said Ron, looking at her incredulously and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball, thrown by George, hit him hard on the side of the head. \"Who\\'re you going with?\" he yelled after Hermione, but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle.\\n\\nThere was no Christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at seven o\\'clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room. The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom other picture.\\n\\n\"Lairy fights, that\\'s the one!\" she giggled when they gave the password, and she swung forward to let them inside.\\n\\nHarry, Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them looking very self�conscious, but none as much as Ron, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face.\\n\\nThere was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else. In a desperate attempt to make them look more manly, he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs. It worked fairly well; at least he was now lace�free, although he hadn\\'t done a very neat job, and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs.\\n\\n\"I still can\\'t work out how you two got the best�looking girls in the year,\" muttered Dean.\\n\\n\"Animal magnetism,\" said Ron gloomily, pulling stray threads out of his cuffs.\\n\\nThe common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black. Parvati was waiting for Harry at the foot of the stairs.\\n\\nShe looked very pretty indeed, in robes of shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists. Harry was relieved to see that she wasn\\'t giggling.\\n\\n\"You � er � look nice,\" he said awkwardly.\\n\\n\"Thanks,\" she said. \"Padma\\'s going to meet you in the entrance hall,\" she added to Ron.\\n\\n\"Right,\" said Ron, looking around. \"Where\\'s Hermione?\"\\n\\nParvati shrugged. \"Shall we go down then, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"Okay,\" said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room. Fred winked at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole.\\n\\nThe entrance hall was packed with students too, all milling around waiting for eight o\\'clock, when the doors to the Great Hall would be thrown open. Those people who were meeting partners from different Houses were edging through the crowd trying to find one another. Parvati found her sister, Padma, and led her over to Harry and Ron.\\n\\n\"Hi,\" said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as Parvati in robes of bright turquoise. She didn\\'t look too enthusiastic about having Ron as a partner, though; her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his dress robes as she looked him up and down.\\n\\n\"Hi,\" said Ron, not looking at her, but staring around at the crowd. \"Oh no ...\"\\n\\nHe bent his knees slightly to hide behind Harry, because Fleur Delacour was passing, looking stunning in robes of silver�gray satin, and accompanied by the\\n\\nRavenclaw Quidditch captain, Roger Davies. When they had disappeared, Ron stood straight again and stared over the heads of the crowd.\\n\\n\"Where is Hermione?\" he said again.\\n\\nA group of Slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common room.\\n\\nMalfoy was in front; he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar, which in Harry\\'s opinion made him look like a vicar. Pansy Parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink was clutching Malfoy\\'s arm. Crabbe and Goyle were both wearing green; they resembled moss�colored boulders, and neither of them, Harry was pleased to see, had managed to find a partner.\\n\\nThe oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the Durmstrang students entered with Professor Karkaroff. Krum was at the front of the party, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes Harry didn\\'t know. Over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights � meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there, and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be Father Christmas and his reindeer.\\n\\nThen Professor McGonagall\\'s voice called, \"Champions over here, please!\"\\n\\nParvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and Harry said, \"See you in a minute\"\\n\\nto Ron and Padma and walked forward, the chattering crowd parting to let them through. Professor McGonagall, who was wearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim other hat, told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside; they were to enter the Great Hall in procession when the rest of the students had sat down.\\n\\nFleur Delacour and Roger Davies stationed themselves nearest the doors; Davies looked so stunned by his good fortune in having Fleur for a partner that he could hardly take his eyes off her. Cedric and Cho were close to Harry too; he looked away from them so he wouldn\\'t have to talk to them. His eyes fell instead on the girl next to Krum. His jaw dropped.\\n\\nIt was Hermione.\\n\\nBut she didn\\'t look like Hermione at all. She had done something with her hair; it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head. She was wearing robes made of a floaty, periwinkle�blue material, and she was holding herself differently, somehow � or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had slung over her back.\\n\\nShe was also smiling � rather nervously, it was true � but the reduction in the size of her front teeth was more noticeable than ever; Harry couldn\\'t understand how he hadn\\'t spotted it before.\\n\\n\"Hi, Harry!\" she said. \"Hi, Parvati!\"\\n\\nParvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief. She wasn\\'t the only one either; when the doors to the Great Hall opened, Krum\\'s fan club from the library\\n\\nstalked past, throwing Hermione looks of deepest loathing. Pansy Parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn\\'t seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her. Ron, however, walked right past Hermione without looking at her.\\n\\nOnce everyone else was settled in the Hall, Professor McGonagall told the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow her. They did so, and everyone in the Great Hall applauded as they entered and started walking up toward a large round table at the top of the Hall, where the judges were sitting.\\n\\nThe walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost, with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling. The House tables had vanished; instead, there were about a hundred smaller, lantern�lit ones, each seating about a dozen people.\\n\\nHarry concentrated on not tripping over his feet. Parvati seemed to be enjoying herself; she was beaming around at everybody, steering Harry so forcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog she was putting through its paces. He caught sight of Ron and Padma as he neared the top table. Ron was watching Hermione pass with narrowed eyes. Padma was looking sulky.\\n\\nDumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table, but Karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like Ron\\'s as he watched Krum and Hermione draw nearer. Ludo Bagman, tonight in robes of bright purple with large yellow stars, was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the students; and Madame Maxime, who had changed her usual uniform of black satin for a flowing gown of lavender silk, was applauding them politely. But Mr. Crouch, Harry suddenly realized, was not there. The fifth seat at the table was occupied by Percy Weasley.\\n\\nWhen the champions and their partners reached the table, Percy drew out the empty chair beside him, staring pointedly at Harry. Harry took the hint and sat down next to Percy, who was wearing brand�new, navy�blue dress robes and an expression of such smugness that Harry thought it ought to be fined.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been promoted,\" Percy said before Harry could even ask, and from his tone, he might have been announcing his election as supreme ruler of the universe. \"I\\'m now Mr. Crouch\\'s personal assistant, and I\\'m here representing him.\"\\n\\n\"Why didn\\'t he come?\" Harry asked. He wasn\\'t looking forward to being lectured on cauldron bottoms all through dinner.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid to say Mr. Crouch isn\\'t well, not well at all. Hasn\\'t been right since the World Cup. Hardly surprising � overwork. He\\'s not as young as he was � though still quite brilliant, of course, the mind remains as great as it ever was. But the World Cup was a fiasco for the whole Ministry, and then, Mr. Crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that house�elf of his, Blinky, or whatever she was called. Naturally, he dismissed her immediately afterward, but � well, as I say, he\\'s getting on, he needs looking after, and I think he\\'s found a\\n\\ndefinite drop in his home comforts since she left. And then we had the tournament to arrange, and the aftermath of the Cup to deal with � that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around � no, poor man, he\\'s having a well earned, quiet Christmas.\\n\\nI\\'m just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place.\"\\n\\nHarry wanted very much to ask whether Mr. Crouch had stopped calling Percy \"Weatherby\" yet, but resisted the temptation.\\n\\nThere was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates, but small menus were lying in front of each of them. Harry picked his up uncertainly and looked around � there were no waiters. Dumbledore, however, looked carefully down at his own menu, then said very clearly to his plate, \"Pork chops!\"\\n\\nAnd pork chops appeared. Getting the idea, the rest of the table placed their orders with their plates too. Harry glanced up at Hermione to see how she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining � surely it meant plenty of extra work for the house�elves? � but for once, Hermione didn\\'t seem to be thinking about S.P.E.W. She was deep in talk with Viktor Krum and hardly seemed to notice what she was eating.\\n\\nIt now occurred to Harry that he had never actually heard Krum speak before, but he was certainly talking now, and very enthusiastically at that.\\n\\n\"Veil, ve have a castle also, not as big as this, nor as comfortable, I am thinking,\"\\n\\nhe was telling Hermione. \"Ve have just four floors, and the fires are lit only for magical purposes. But ve have grounds larger even than these � though in vinter, ve have very little daylight, so ve are not enjoying them. But in summer ve are flying every day, over the lakes and the mountains �\"\\n\\n\"Now, now, Viktor!\" said Karkaroff with a laugh that didn\\'t reach his cold eyes, \"don\\'t go giving away anything else, now, or your charming friend will know exactly where to find us!\"\\n\\nDumbledore smiled, his eyes twinkling. \"Igor, all this secrecy ., . one would almost think you didn\\'t want visitors.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Dumbledore,\" said Karkaroff, displaying his yellowing teeth to their fullest extent, \"we are all protective of our private domains, are we not? Do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us? Are we not right to be proud that we alone know our school\\'s secrets, and right to protect them?\"\\n\\n\"Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts\\' secrets, Igor,\" said Dumbledore amicably. \"Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished. But I must keep an eye out for it. Possibly it is only accessible at five�thirty in the morning. Or it may only appear at the quarter moon � or when\\n\\nthe seeker has an exceptionally full bladder.\"\\n\\nHarry snorted into his plate of goulash. Percy frowned, but Harry could have sworn Dumbledore had given him a very small wink.\\n\\nMeanwhile Fleur Delacour was criticizing the Hogwarts decorations to Roger Davies.\\n\\n\"Zis is nothing,\" she said dismissively, looking around at the sparkling walls of the Great Hall. \"At ze Palace of Beauxbatons, we \\'ave ice sculptures all around ze dining chamber at Chreestmas. Zey do not melt, of course . . . zey are like \\'uge statues of diamond, glittering around ze place. And ze food is seemply superb.\\n\\nAnd we \\'ave choirs of wood nymphs, \\'oo serenade us as we eat. We \\'ave none of zis ugly armor in ze \\'alls, and eef a poltergeist ever entaired into Beauxbatons, \\'e would be expelled like zat.\" She slapped her hand onto the table impatiently.\\n\\nRoger Davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his face, and he kept missing his mouth with his fork. Harry had the impression that Davies was too busy staring at Fleur to take in a word she was saying.\\n\\n\"Absolutely right,\" he said quickly, slapping his own hand down on the table in imitation of Fleur. \"Like that. Yeah.\"\\n\\nHarry looked around the Hall. Hagrid was sitting at one of the other staff tables; he was back in his horrible hairy brown suit and gazing up at the top table. Harry saw him give a small wave, and looking around, saw Madame Maxime return it, her opals glittering in the candlelight.\\n\\nHermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept calling her \"Hermy�own.\"\\n\\n\"Her�my�oh�nee,\" she said slowly and clearly.\\n\\n\"Herm�own�ninny.\"\\n\\n\"Close enough,\" she said, catching Harry\\'s eye and grinning.\\n\\nWhen all the food had been consumed, Dumbledore stood up and asked the students to do the same. Then, with a wave of his wand, all the tables zoomed back along the walls leaving the floor clear, and then he conjured a raised platform into existence along the right wall. A set of drums, several guitars, a lute, a cello, and some bagpipes were set upon it.\\n\\nThe \"Weird Sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic applause; they were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn. They picked up their instruments, and Harry, who had been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten what was coming, suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out, and that the other champions and their partners were standing up.\\n\\n\"Come on!\" Parvati hissed. \"We\\'re supposed to dance!\"\\n\\nHarry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up. The Weird Sisters struck up a slow, mournful tune; Harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor, carefully avoiding catching anyone\\'s eye (he could see Seamus and Dean waving at him and sniggering), and next moment, Parvati had seized his hands, placed one around her waist, and was holding the other tightly in hers.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t as bad as it could have been. Harry thought, revolving slowly on the spot (Parvati was steering). He kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the watching people, and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance floor, so that the champions were no longer the center of attention. Neville and Ginny were dancing nearby � he could see Ginny wincing frequently as Neville trod on her feet � and Dumbledore was waltzing with Madame Maxime. He was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat barely tickled her chin; however, she moved very gracefully for a woman so large. Mad�Eye Moody was doing an extremely ungainly two�step with Professor Sinistra, who was nervously avoiding his wooden leg.\\n\\n\"Nice socks. Potter,\" Moody growled as he passed, his magical eye staring through Harry\\'s robes.\\n\\n\"Oh � yeah, Dobby the house�elf knitted them for me,\" said Harry, grinning.\\n\\n\"He is so creepy!\" Parvati whispered as Moody clunked away. \"I don\\'t think that eye should be allowed.\"\\n\\nHarry heard the final, quavering note from the bagpipe with relief. The Weird Sisters stopped playing, applause filled the hall once more, and Harry let go of Parvati at once.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s sit down, shall we?\"\\n\\n\"Oh � but � this is a really good one!\" Parvati said as the Weird Sisters struck up a new song, which was much faster.\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t like it,\" Harry lied, and he led her away from the dance floor, past Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them were backing away in fear of injury, and over to the table where Ron and Padma were sitting.\\n\\n\"How\\'s it going?\" Harry asked Ron, sitting down and opening a bottle of butterbeer.\\n\\nRon didn\\'t answer. He was glaring at Hermione and Krum, who were dancing nearby. Padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed, one foot jiggling in time to the music. Every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at Ron, who was completely ignoring her. Parvati sat down on Harry\\'s other side, crossed her arms and legs too, and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from\\n\\nBeauxbatons.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t mind, do you, Harry?\" Parvati said.\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry, who was now watching Cho and Cedric.\\n\\n\"Oh never mind,\" snapped Parvati, and she went off with the boy from Beauxbatons. When the song ended, she did not return.\\n\\nHermione came over and sat down in Parvati\\'s empty chair. She was a bit pink in the face from dancing.\\n\\n\"Hi,\" said Harry. Ron didn\\'t say anything.\\n\\n\"It\\'s hot, isn\\'t it?\" said Hermione, fanning herself with her hand. \"Viktors just gone to get some drinks.\"\\n\\nRon gave her a withering look. \"Viktor?\" he said. \"Hasn\\'t he asked you to call him Vicky yet?\"\\n\\nHermione looked at him in surprise. \"What\\'s up with you?\" she said.\\n\\n\"If you don\\'t know,\" said Ron scathingly, \"I\\'m not going to tell you.\"\\n\\nHermione stared at him, then at Harry, who shrugged.\\n\\n\"Ron, what � ?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s from Durmstrang!\" spat Ron. \"He\\'s competing against Harry! Against Hogwarts! You � you\\'re �\" Ron was obviously casting around for words strong enough to describe Hermione\\'s crime, \"fraternizing with the enemy, that\\'s what you\\'re doing!\"\\n\\nHermione\\'s mouth fell open.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be so stupid!\" she said after a moment. \"The enemy! Honestly � who was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive? Who was the one who wanted his autograph? Who\\'s got a model of him up in their dormitory?\"\\n\\nRon chose to ignore this. \"I s\\'pose he asked you to come with him while you were both in the library?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he did,\" said Hermione, the pink patches on her cheeks glowing more brightly. \"So what?\"\\n\\n\"What happened � trying to get him to join spew, were you?\"\\n\\n\"No, I wasn\\'t! If you really want to know, he � he said he\\'d been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me, but he hadn\\'t been able to pluck up the courage!\"\\n\\nHermione said this very quickly, and blushed so deeply that she was the same\\n\\ncolor as Parvati\\'s robes.\\n\\n\"Yeah, well � that\\'s his story,\" said Ron nastily.\\n\\n\"And what\\'s that supposed to mean?\"\\n\\n\"Obvious, isn\\'t it? He\\'s Karkaroff\\'s student, isn\\'t he? He knows who you hang around with. . . . He\\'s just trying to get closer to Harry � get inside information on him � or get near enough to jinx him �\"\\n\\nHermione looked as though Ron had slapped her. When she spoke, her voice quivered.\\n\\n\"For your information, he hasn\\'t asked me one single thing about Harry, not one �\"\\n\\nRon changed tack at the speed of light.\\n\\n\"Then he\\'s hoping you\\'ll help him find out what his egg means! I suppose you\\'ve been putting your heads together during those cozy little library sessions �\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d never help him work out that egg!\" said Hermione, looking outraged. \"Never.\\n\\nHow could you say something like that � I want Harry to win the tournament.\\n\\nHarry knows that, don\\'t you, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got a funny way of showing it,\" sneered Ron.\\n\\n\"This whole tournament\\'s supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards and making friends with them!\" said Hermione hotly.\\n\\n\"No it isn\\'t!\" shouted Ron. \"It\\'s about winning!\"\\n\\nPeople were starting to stare at them.\\n\\n\"Ron,\" said Harry quietly, \"I haven\\'t got a problem with Hermione coming with Krum �\"\\n\\nBut Ron ignored Harry too.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you go and find Vicky, he\\'ll be wondering where you are,\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t call him Vicky!\"\\n\\nHermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor, disappearing into the crowd. Ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his face.\\n\\n\"Are you going to ask me to dance at all?\" Padma asked him.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ron, still glaring after Hermione.\\n\\n\"Fine,\" snapped Padma, and she got up and went to join Parvati and the Beauxbatons boy, who conjured up one of his friends to join them so fast that\\n\\nHarry could have sworn he had zoomed him there by a Summoning Charm.\\n\\n\"Vare is Herm�own�ninny?\" said a voice.\\n\\nKrum had just arrived at their table clutching two butterbeers.\\n\\n\"No idea,\" said Ron mulishly, looking up at him. \"Lost her, have you?\"\\n\\nKrum was looking surly again.\\n\\n\"Veil, if you see her, tell her I haff drinks,\" he said, and he slouched off.\\n\\n\"Made friends with Viktor Krum, have you, Ron?\"\\n\\nPercy had bustled over, rubbing his hands together and looking extremely pompous. \"Excellent! That\\'s the whole point, you know � international magical cooperation!\"\\n\\nTo Harry\\'s displeasure, Percy now took Padma\\'s vacated seat. The top table was now empty; Professor Dumbledore was dancing with Professor Sprout, Ludo Bagman with Professor McGonagall; Madame Maxime and Hagrid were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students, and Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen. When the next song ended, everybody applauded once more, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor McGonagall\\'s hand and make his way back through the crowds, at which point Fred and George accosted him.\\n\\n\"What do they think they\\'re doing, annoying senior Ministry members?\" Percy hissed, watching Fred and George suspiciously. \"No respect...\"\\n\\nLudo Bagman shook off Fred and George fairly quickly, however, and, spotting Harry, waved and came over to their table.\\n\\n\"I hope my brothers weren\\'t bothering you, Mr. Bagman?\" said Percy at once.\\n\\n\"What? Oh not at all, not at all!\" said Bagman. \"No, they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs. Wondering if I could advise them on the marketing. I\\'ve promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko\\'s Joke Shop. ...\"\\n\\nPercy didn\\'t look happy about this at all, and Harry was prepared to bet he would be rushing to tell Mrs. Weasley about this the moment he got home. Apparently Fred and George\\'s plans had grown even more ambitious lately, if they were hoping to sell to the public. Bagman opened his mouth to ask Harry something, but Percy diverted him.\\n\\n\"How do you feel the tournament\\'s going, Mr. Bagman? Our department\\'s quite satisfied � the hitch with the Goblet of Fire\" � he glanced at Harry � \"was a little unfortunate, of course, but it seems to have gone very smoothly since, don\\'t you think?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes,\" Bagman said cheerfully, \"it\\'s all been enormous fun. How\\'s old Barty doing? Shame he couldn\\'t come.\"\\n\\n\"Oh I\\'m sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time,\" said Percy importantly, \"but in the meantime, I\\'m more than willing to take up the slack. Of course, it\\'s not all attending balls\" � he laughed airily � \"oh no, I\\'ve had to deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence � you heard Ali Bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the country? And then we\\'ve been trying to persuade the Transylvanians to sign the International Ban on Dueling.\\n\\nI\\'ve got a meeting with their Head of Magical Cooperation in the new year �\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s go for a walk,\" Ron muttered to Harry, \"get away from Percy. ...\"\\n\\nPretending they wanted more drinks. Harry and Ron left the table, edged around the dance floor, and slipped out into the entrance hall. The front doors stood open, and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose garden winked and twinkled as they went down the front steps, where they found themselves surrounded by bushes; winding, ornamental paths; and large stone statues. Harry could hear splashing water, which sounded like a fountain. Here and there, people were sitting on carved benches. He and Ron set off along one of the winding paths through the rosebushes, but they had gone only a short way when they heard an unpleasantly familiar voice.\\n\\n\"... don\\'t see what there is to fuss about, Igor.\"\\n\\n\"Severus, you cannot pretend this isn\\'t happening!\" Karkaroffs voice sounded anxious and hushed, as though keen not to be overheard. \"It\\'s been getting clearer and clearer for months. I am becoming seriously concerned, I can\\'t deny it _\"\\n\\n\"Then flee,\" said Snapes voice curtly. \"Flee � I will make your excuses. I, however, am remaining at Hogwarts.\"\\n\\nSnape and Karkaroff came around the corner. Snape had his wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart, his expression most ill�natured. Squeals issued from many of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from them.\\n\\n\"Ten points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!\" Snape snarled as a girl ran past him. \"And ten points from Hufflepuff too, Stebbins!\" as a boy went rushing after her. \"And what are you two doing?\" he added, catching sight of Harry and Ron on the path ahead. Karkaroff, Harry saw, looked slightly discomposed to see them standing there. His hand went nervously to his goatee, and he began winding it around his finger.\\n\\n\"We re walking,\" Ron told Snape shortly. \"Not against the law, is it?\"\\n\\n\"Keep walking, then!\" Snape snarled, and he brushed past them, his long black cloak billowing out behind him. Karkaroff hurried away after Snape. Harry and Ron continued down the path.\\n\\n\"What\\'s got Karkaroff all worried?\" Ron muttered.\\n\\n\"And since when have he and Snape been on first�name terms?\"said Harry slowly.\\n\\nThey had reached a large stone reindeer now, over which they could see the sparkling jets of a tall fountain. The shadowy outlines of two enormous people were visible on a stone bench, watching the water in the moonlight. And then Harry heard Hagrid speak.\\n\\n\"Momen\\' I saw yeh, I knew,\" he was saying, in an oddly husky voice.\\n\\nHarry and Ron froze. This didn\\'t sound like the sort of scene they ought to walk in on, somehow. . . . Harry looked around, back up the path, and saw Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies standing half�concealed in a rosebush nearby. He tapped Ron on the shoulder and jerked his head toward them, meaning that they could easily sneak off that way without being noticed (Fleur and Davies looked very busy to Harry), but Ron, eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur, shook his head vigorously, and pulled Harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer.\\n\\n\"What did you know, \\'Agrid?\" said Madame Maxime, a purr in her low voice.\\n\\nHarry definitely didn\\'t want to listen to this; he knew Hagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like this (he certainly would have) � if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly, but that wasn\\'t really an option. Instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling along the stone reindeer\\'s back, but the beetle just wasn\\'t interesting enough to block out Hagrid\\'s next words.\\n\\n\"I jus\\' knew . . . knew you were like me. . . . Was it yer mother or yer father?\"\\n\\n\"I � I don\\'t know what you mean, \\'Agrid. ...\"\\n\\n\"It was my mother,\" said Hagrid quietly. \"She was one o\\' the las\\' ones in Britain.\\n\\n\\'Course, I can\\' remember her too well. . . she left, see. When I was abou\\' three. She wasn\\' really the maternal sort. Well. . . it\\'s not in their natures, is it? Dunno what happened to her . . . might be dead fer all I know. ...\"\\n\\nMadame Maxime didn\\'t say anything. And Harry, in spite of himself, took his eyes off the beetle and looked over the top of the reindeer\\'s antlers, listening. ... He had never heard Hagrid talk about his childhood before.\\n\\n\"Me dad was broken�hearted when she wen\\'. Tiny little bloke, my dad was. By the time I was six I could lift him up an\\' put him on top o\\' the dresser if he annoyed me. Used ter make him laugh. . . .\" Hagrid\\'s deep voice broke. Madame Maxime was listening, motionless, apparently staring at the silvery fountain. \"Dad raised me . . . but he died, o\\' course, jus\\' after I started school. Sorta had ter make me own way after that. Dumbledore was a real help, mind. Very kind ter me, he was. . . .\"\\n\\nHagrid pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief and blew his nose heavily.\\n\\n\"So ... anyway . . . enough abou\\' me. What about you? Which side you got it on?\"\\n\\nBut Madame Maxime had suddenly got to her feet.\\n\\n\"It is chilly,\" she said � but whatever the weather was doing, it was nowhere near as cold as her voice. \"I think I will go in now.\"\\n\\n\"Eh?\" said Hagrid blankly. \"No, don go! I\\'ve � I\\'ve never met another one before!\"\\n\\n\"Anuzzer what, precisely?\" said Madame Maxime, her tone icy.\\n\\nHarry could have told Hagrid it was best not to answer; he stood there in the shadows gritting his teeth, hoping against hope he wouldn\\'t � but it was no good.\\n\\n\"Another half�giant, o\\' course!\" said Hagrid.\\n\\n\"\\'Ow dare you!\" shrieked Madame Maxime. Her voice exploded through the peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him. Harry heard Fleur and Roger fall out of their rosebush. \"I \\'ave nevair been more insulted in my life! \\'Alf�giant? Moi? I \\'ave � I \\'ave big bones!\"\\n\\nShe stormed away; great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into the air as she passed, angrily pushing aside bushes. Hagrid was still sitting on the bench, staring after her. It was much too dark to make out his expression. Then, after about a minute, he stood up and strode away, not back to the castle, but off out into the dark grounds in the direction of his cabin.\\n\\n\"C\\'mon,\" Harry said, very quietly to Ron. \"Let\\'s go. . . .\"\\n\\nBut Ron didn\\'t move.\\n\\n\"What\\'s up?\" said Harry, looking at him.\\n\\nRon looked around at Harry, his expression very serious indeed.\\n\\n\"Did you know?\" he whispered. \"About Hagrid being half�giant?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" Harry said, shrugging. \"So what?\"\\n\\nHe knew immediately, from the look Ron was giving him, that he was once again revealing his ignorance of the wizarding world. Brought up by the Dursleys, there were many things that wizards took for granted that were revelations to Harry, but these surprises had become fewer with each successive year. Now, however, he could tell that most wizards would not have said \"So what?\" upon finding out that one of their friends had a giantess for a mother.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll explain inside,\" said Ron quietly, \"c\\'mon. . ..\"\\n\\nFleur and Roger Davies had disappeared, probably into a more private clump of bushes. Harry and Ron returned to the Great Hall. Parvati and Padma were now sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of Beauxbatons boys, and Hermione was once more dancing with Krum. Harry and Ron sat down at a table far\\n\\nremoved from the dance floor.\\n\\n\"So?\" Harry prompted Ron. \"What\\'s the problem with giants?\"\\n\\n\"Well, they\\'re . . . they\\'re . . .\" Ron struggled for words. \". . . not very nice,\" he finished lamely.\\n\\n\"Who cares?\" Harry said. \"There\\'s nothing wrong with Hagrid!\"\\n\\n\"I know there isn\\'t, but. . . blimey, no wonder he keeps it quiet,\" Ron said, shaking his head. \"I always thought he\\'d got in the way of a bad Engorgement Charm when he was a kid or something. Didn\\'t like to mention it. ...\"\\n\\n\"But what\\'s it matter if his mother was a giantess?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Well... no one who knows him will care, \\'cos they\\'ll know he\\'s not dangerous,\"\\n\\nsaid Ron slowly. \"But. . . Harry, they\\'re just vicious, giants. It\\'s like Hagrid said, it\\'s in their natures, they\\'re like trolls . . . they just like killing, everyone knows that. There aren\\'t any left in Britain now, though.\"\\n\\n\"What happened to them?\"\\n\\n\"Well, they were dying out anyway, and then loads got themselves killed by Aurors. There\\'re supposed to be giants abroad, though. . . . They hide out in mountains mostly. . . .\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know who Maxime thinks she\\'s kidding,\" Harry said, watching Madame Maxime sitting alone at the judges\\' table, looking very somber. \"If Hagrid\\'s half� giant, she definitely is. Big bones . .. the only thing that\\'s got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur.\"\\n\\nHarry and Ron spent the rest of the ball discussing giants in their corner, neither of them having any inclination to dance. Harry tried not to watch Cho and Cedric too much; it gave him a strong desire to kick something.\\n\\nWhen the Weird Sisters finished playing at midnight, everyone gave them a last, loud round of applause and started to wend their way into the entrance hall. Many people were expressing the wish that the ball could have gone on longer, but Harry was perfectly happy to be going to bed; as far as he was concerned, the evening hadn\\'t been much fun.\\n\\nOut in the entrance hall, Harry and Ron saw Hermione saying good night to Krum before he went back to the Durmstrang ship. She gave Ron a very cold look and swept past him up the marble staircase without speaking. Harry and Ron followed her, but halfway up the staircase Harry heard someone calling him.\\n\\n\"Hey�Harry!\"\\n\\nIt was Cedric Diggory. Harry could see Cho waiting for him in the entrance hall below.\\n\\n\"Yeah?\" said Harry coldly as Cedric ran up the stairs toward him.\\n\\nCedric looked as though he didn\\'t want to say whatever it was in front of Ron, who shrugged, looking bad�tempered, and continued to climb the stairs.\\n\\n\"Listen ...\" Cedric lowered his voice as Ron disappeared. \"I owe you one for telling me about the dragons. You know that golden egg? Does yours wail when you open it?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Well... take a bath, okay?\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"Take a bath, and � er � take the egg with you, and � er � just mull things over in the hot water. It\\'ll help you think. . . . Trust me.\"\\n\\nHarry stared at him.\\n\\n\"Tell you what,\" Cedric said, \"use the prefects\\' bathroom. Fourth door to the left of that statue of Boris the Bewildered on the fifth floor. Password\\'s \\'pine fresh.\\' Gotta go ... want to say good night �\"\\n\\nHe grinned at Harry again and hurried back down the stairs to Cho.\\n\\nHarry walked back to Gryffindor Tower alone. That had been extremely strange advice. Why would a bath help him to work out what the wailing egg meant? Was Cedric pulling his leg? Was he trying to make Harry look like a fool, so Cho would like him even more by comparison!\\n\\nThe Fat Lady and her friend Vi were snoozing in the picture over the portrait hole.\\n\\nHarry had to yell \"Fairy lights!\" before he woke them up, and when he did, they were extremely irritated. He climbed into the common room and found Ron and Hermione having a blazing row. Standing ten feet apart, they were bellowing at each other, each scarlet in the face.\\n\\n\"Well, if you don\\'t like it, you know what the solution is, don\\'t you?\" yelled Hermione; her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now, and her face was screwed up in anger.\\n\\n\"Oh yeah?\" Ron yelled back. \"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"Next time there\\'s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!\"\\n\\nRon mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as Hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the girls\\' staircase to bed. Ron turned to look at Harry.\\n\\n\"Well,\" he sputtered, looking thunderstruck, \"well � that just proves � completely missed the point �\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t say anything. He liked being back on speaking terms with Ron too much to speak his mind right now � but he somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had.\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY�FOUR � RITA SKEETER\\'S SCOOP\\n\\nEverybody got up late on Boxing Day. The Gryffindor common room was much quieter than it had been lately, many yawns punctuating the lazy conversations.\\n\\nHermione\\'s hair was bushy again; she confessed to Harry that she had used liberal amounts of Sleekeazy\\'s Hair Potion on it for the ball, \"but it\\'s way too much bother to do every day,\" she said matter�of�factly, scratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears.\\n\\nRon and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though oddly formal.\\n\\nRon and Harry wasted no time in telling Hermione about the conversation they had overheard between Madame Maxime and Hagrid, but Hermione didn\\'t seem to find the news that Hagrid was a half�giant nearly as shocking as Ron did.\\n\\n\"Well, I thought he must be,\" she said, shrugging. \"I knew he couldn\\'t be pure giant because they\\'re about twenty feet tall. But honestly, all this hysteria about giants. They can\\'t all be horrible. . . . It\\'s the same sort of prejudice that people have toward werewolves. . . . It\\'s just bigotry, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\nRon looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly, but perhaps he didn\\'t want another row, because he contented himself with shaking his head disbelievingly while Hermione wasn\\'t looking.\\n\\nIt was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during the first week of the holidays. Everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that Christmas was over � everybody except Harry, that is, who was starting (once again) to feel slightly nervous.\\n\\nThe trouble was that February the twenty�fourth looked a lot closer from this side of Christmas, and he still hadn\\'t done anything about working out the clue inside the golden egg. He therefore started taking the egg out of his trunk every time he went up to the dormitory, opening it, and listening intently, hoping that this time it would make some sense. He strained to think what the sound reminded him of, apart from thirty musical saws, but he had never heard anything else like it. He closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and opened it again to see if the sound had changed, but it hadn\\'t. He tried asking the egg questions, shouting over all the wailing, but nothing happened. He even threw the egg across the room � though he hadn\\'t really expected that to help.\\n\\nHarry had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had given him, but his less�than� friendly feelings toward Cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take his help if he could avoid it. In any case, it seemed to him that if Cedric had really wanted to give Harry a hand, he would have been a lot more explicit. He, Harry, had told Cedric exactly what was coming in the first task � and Cedric\\'s idea of a\\n\\nfair exchange had been to tell Harry to take a bath. Well, he didn\\'t need that sort of rubbishy help � not from someone who kept walking down corridors hand in hand with Cho, anyway. And so the first day of the new term arrived, and Harry set off to lessons, weighed down with books, parchment, and quills as usual, but also with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his stomach, as though he were carrying that around with him too.\\n\\nSnow was still thick upon the grounds, and the greenhouse windows were covered in condensation so thick that they couldn\\'t see out of them in Herbology. Nobody was looking forward to Care of Magical Creatures much in this weather, though as Ron said, the skrewts would probably warm them up nicely, either by chasing them, or blasting off so forcefully that Hagrid\\'s cabin would catch fire.\\n\\nWhen they arrived at Hagrid \\'s cabin, however, they found an elderly witch with closely cropped gray hair and a very prominent chin standing before his front door.\\n\\n\"Hurry up, now, the bell rang five minutes ago,\" she barked at them as they struggled toward her through the snow.\\n\\n\"Who\\'re you?\" said Ron, staring at her. \"Wheres Hagrid?\"\\n\\n\"My name is Professor Grubbly�Plank,\" she said briskly. \"I am your temporary Care of Magical Creatures teacher.\"\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Hagrid?\" Harry repeated loudly.\\n\\n\"He is indisposed,\" said Professor Grubbly�Plank shortly.\\n\\nSoft and unpleasant laughter reached Harrys ears. He turned; Draco Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherins were joining the class. All of them looked gleeful, and none of them looked surprised to see Professor Grubbly�Plank.\\n\\n\"This way, please,\" said Professor Grubbly�Plank, and she strode off around the paddock where the Beauxbatons horses were shivering. Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed her, looking back over their shoulders at Hagrid\\'s cabin. All the curtains were closed. Was Hagrid in there, alone and ill!\\n\\n\"What\\'s wrong with Hagrid?\" Harry said, hurrying to catch up with Professor Grubbly�Plank.\\n\\n\"Never you mind,\" she said as though she thought he was being nosy.\\n\\n\"I do mind, though,\" said Harry hotly. \"What\\'s up with him?\"\\n\\nProfessor Grubbly�Plank acted as though she couldn\\'t hear him. She led them past the paddock where the huge Beauxbatons horses were standing, huddled against the cold, and toward a tree on the edge of the forest, where a large and beautiful unicorn was tethered.\\n\\nMany of the girls \"ooooohed!\" at the sight of the unicorn.\\n\\n\"Oh it\\'s so beautiful!\" whispered Lavender Brown. \"How did she get it? They\\'re supposed to be really hard to catch!\"\\n\\nThe unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow all around look gray. It was pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves and throwing back its horned head.\\n\\n\"Boys keep back!\" barked Professor Grubbly�Plank, throwing out an arm and catching Harry hard in the chest. \"They prefer the woman\\'s touch, unicorns. Girls to the front, and approach with care, come on, easy does it. ...\"\\n\\nShe and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn, leaving the boys standing near the paddock fence, watching. The moment Professor Grubbly�Plank was out of earshot. Harry turned to Ron.\\n\\n\"What d\\'you reckons wrong with him? You don\\'t think a skrewt � ?\"\\n\\n\"Oh he hasn\\'t been attacked, Potter, if that\\'s what you\\'re thinking,\" said Malfoy softly. \"No, he\\'s just too ashamed to show his big, ugly face.\"\\n\\n\"What d\\'you mean?\" said Harry sharply.\\n\\nMalfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes and pulled out a folded page of newsprint.\\n\\n\"There you go,\" he said. \"Hate to break it to you. Potter. ...\"\\n\\nHe smirked as Harry snatched the page, unfolded it, and read it, with Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.\\n\\nDUMBLEDORE\\'S GIANT MISTAKE Albus Dumbledore, eccentric Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make controversial staff appointments, writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. In September of this year, he hired Alastor \"Mad�Eye\" Moody, the notoriously jinx�happy ex�Auror, to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody\\'s well�known habit of attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence. Mad�Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set beside the part�human Dumbledore employs to teach Care of Magical Creatures.\\n\\nRubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year, however, Hagrid used his mysterious influence over the headmaster to secure the additional post of Care of Magical Creatures teacher, over the heads of many better�qualified candidates.\\n\\nAn alarmingly large and ferocious�looking man, Hagrid has been using his newfound authority to terrify the students in his care with a succession of horrific creatures. While Dumbledore turns a blind eye, Hagrid has maimed several pupils during a series of lessons that many admit to being \"very frightening.\"\\n\\n\\'I was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend Vincent Crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm,\" says Draco Malfoy, a fourth�year student. \"We all hate Hagrid, but we\\'re just too scared to say anything.\"\\n\\nHagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation, however. In conversation with a Daily Prophet reporter last month, he admitted breeding creatures he has dubbed \"Blast�Ended Skrewts,\" highly dangerous crosses between manti�cores and fire�crabs. The creation of new breeds of magical creature is, of course, an activity usually closely observed by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Hagrid, however, considers himself to be above such petty restrictions.\\n\\n\"I was just having some fun,\" he says, before hastily changing the subject.\\n\\nAs if this were not enough, the Daily Prophet has now unearthed evidence that Hagrid is not � as he has always pretended � a pure�blood wizard. He is not, in fact, even pure human. His mother, we can exclusively reveal, is none other than the giantess Fridwulfa, whose whereabouts are currently unknown.\\n\\nBloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought themselves to the point of extinction by warring amongst themselves during the last century. The handful that remained joined the ranks of He�Who�Must�Not�Be�Named, and were responsible for some of the worst mass Muggle killings of his reign of terror.\\n\\nWhile many of the giants who served He�Who�Must�Not�Be�Named were killed by Aurors working against the Dark Side, Fridwulfa was not among them. It is possible she escaped to one of the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges. If his antics during Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any guide, however, Frid�wulfa\\'s son appears to have inherited her brutal nature.\\n\\nIn a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around You�Know�Who\\'s fall from power � thereby driving Hagrid\\'s own mother, like the rest of You�Know�Who\\'s supporters, into hiding.\\n\\nPerhaps Harry Potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend � but Albus Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating with part�giants.\\n\\nHarry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging open.\\n\\n\"How did she find out?\" he whispered.\\n\\nBut that wasn\\'t what was bothering Harry.\\n\\n\"What d\\'you mean, \\'we all hate Hagrid\\'?\" Harry spat at Malfoy. \"What\\'s this\\n\\nrubbish about him\" � he pointed at Crabbe � \"getting a bad bite off a flobberworm!\\n\\nThey haven\\'t even got teeth!\"\\n\\nCrabbe was sniggering, apparently very pleased with himself.\\n\\n\"Well, I think this should put an end to the oaf\\'s teaching career,\" said Malfoy, his eyes glinting. \"Half�giant. . . and there was me thinking he\\'d just swallowed a bottle of Skele�Gro when he was young. ... None of the mummies and daddies are going to like this at all. ... They\\'ll be worried he\\'ll eat their kids, ha, ha. ...\"\\n\\n\"You�\"\\n\\n\"Are you paying attention over there?\"\\n\\nProfessor Grubbly�Planks voice carried over to the boys; the girls were all clustered around the unicorn now, stroking it. Harry was so angry that the Daily Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly�Plank was now enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too.\\n\\n\"I hope she stays, that woman!\" said Parvati Patil when the lesson had ended and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch. \"That\\'s more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like . . . proper creatures like unicorns, not monsters. . . .\"\\n\\n\"What about Hagrid?\" Harry said angrily as they went up the steps.\\n\\n\"What about him?\" said Parvati in a hard voice. \"He can still be gamekeeper, can\\'t he?\"\\n\\nParvati had been very cool toward Harry since the ball. He supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to have had a good time all the same. She was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from Beauxbatons in Hogsmeade on the next weekend trip.\\n\\n\"That was a really good lesson,\" said Hermione as they entered the Great Hall. \"I didn\\'t know half the things Professor Grubbly�Plank told us about uni �\"\\n\\n\"Look at this!\" Harry snarled, and he shoved the Daily Prophet article under Hermione\\'s nose.\\n\\nHermione\\'s mouth fell open as she read. Her reaction was exactly the same as Ron\\'s.\\n\\n\"How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out? You don\\'t think Hagrid told her?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry, leading the way over to the Gryffindor table and throwing himself into a chair, furious. \"He never even told us, did he? I reckon she was so mad he wouldn\\'t give her loads of horrible stuff about me, she went ferreting\\n\\naround to get him back.\"\\n\\n\"Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball,\" said Hermione quietly.\\n\\n\"We\\'d have seen her in the garden!\" said Ron. \"Anyway, she\\'s not supposed to come into school anymore, Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Maybe she\\'s got an Invisibility Cloak,\" said Harry, ladling chicken casserole onto his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger. \"Sort of thing she\\'d do, isn\\'t it, hide in bushes listening to people.\"\\n\\n\"Like you and Ron did, you mean,\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"We weren\\'t trying to hear him!\" said Ron indignantly. \"We didn\\'t have any choice! The stupid prat, talking about his giantess mother where anyone could have heard him!\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got to go and see him,\" said Harry. \"This evening, after Divination. Tell him we want him back . . . you do want him back?\" he shot at Hermione.\\n\\n\"I � well, I\\'m not going to pretend it didn\\'t make a nice change, having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once � but I do want Hagrid back, of course I do!\" Hermione added hastily, quailing under Harry\\'s furious stare.\\n\\nSo that evening after dinner, the three of them left the castle once more and went down through the frozen grounds to Hagrid\\'s cabin. They knocked, and Fang\\'s booming barks answered.\\n\\n\"Hagrid, it\\'s us!\" Harry shouted, pounding on the door. \"Open up!\"\\n\\nHagrid didn\\'t answer. They could hear Fang scratching at the door, whining, but it didn\\'t open. They hammered on it for ten more minutes; Ron even went and banged on one of the windows, but there was no response.\\n\\n\"What\\'s he avoiding us for?\" Hermione said when they had finally given up and were walking back to the school. \"He surely doesn\\'t think we\\'d care about him being half�giant?\"\\n\\nBut it seemed that Hagrid did care. They didn\\'t see a sign of him all week. He didn\\'t appear at the staff table at mealtimes, they didn\\'t see him going about his gamekeeper duties on the grounds, and Professor Grubbly�Plank continued to take the Care of Magical Creatures classes. Malfoy was gloating at every possible opportunity.\\n\\n\"Missing your half�breed pal?\" he kept whispering to Harry whenever there was a teacher around, so that he was safe from Harry\\'s retaliation. \"Missing the elephant� man?\"\\n\\nThere was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January. Hermione was very\\n\\nsurprised that Harry was going to go.\\n\\n\"I just thought you\\'d want to take advantage of the common room being quiet,\"\\n\\nshe said. \"Really get to work on that egg.\"\\n\\n\"Oh I � I reckon I\\'ve got a pretty good idea what it\\'s about now,\" Harry lied.\\n\\n\"Have you really?\" said Hermione, looking impressed. \"Well done!\"\\n\\nHarrys insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them. He still had five weeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages. . . whereas if he went into Hogsmeade, he might run into Hagrid, and get a chance to persuade him to come back.\\n\\nHe, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together on Saturday and set off through the cold, wet grounds toward the gates. As they passed the Durmstrang ship moored in the lake, they saw Viktor Krum emerge onto the deck, dressed in nothing but swimming trunks. He was very skinny indeed, but apparently a lot tougher than he looked, because he climbed up onto the side of the ship, stretched out his arms, and dived, right into the lake.\\n\\n\"He\\'s mad!\" said Harry, staring at Krums dark head as it bobbed out into the middle of the lake. \"It must be freezing, it\\'s January!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a lot colder where he comes from,\" said Hermione. \"I suppose it feels quite warm to him.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, but there\\'s still the giant squid,\" said Ron. He didn\\'t sound anxious � if anything, he sounded hopeful. Hermione noticed his tone of voice and frowned.\\n\\n\"He\\'s really nice, you know,\" she said. \"He\\'s not at all like you\\'d think, coming from Durmstrang. He likes it much better here, he told me.\"\\n\\nRon said nothing. He hadn\\'t mentioned Viktor Krum since the ball, but Harry had found a miniature arm under his bed on Boxing Day, which had looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing Bulgarian Quidditch robes.\\n\\nHarry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of Hagrid all the way down the slushy High Street, and suggested a visit to the Three Broomsticks once he had ascertained that Hagrid was not in any of the shops.\\n\\nThe pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look around at all the tables told Harry that Hagrid wasn\\'t there. Heart sinking, he went up to the bar with Ron and Hermione, ordered three butterbeers from Madam Rosmerta, and thought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to the egg wailing after all.\\n\\n\"Doesn\\'t he ever go into the office?\" Hermione whispered suddenly. \"Look!\"\\n\\nShe pointed into the mirror behind the bar, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman reflected there, sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch of goblins. Bagman was talking very fast in a low voice to the goblins, all of whom had their arms crossed and were looking rather menacing.\\n\\nIt was indeed odd. Harry thought, that Bagman was here at the Three Broomsticks on a weekend when there was no Triwizard event, and therefore no judging to be done. He watched Bagman in the mirror. He was looking strained again, quite as strained as he had that night in the forest before the Dark Mark had appeared. But just then Bagman glanced over at the bar, saw Harry, and stood up.\\n\\n\"In a moment, in a moment!\" Harry heard him say brusquely to the goblins, and Bagman hurried through the pub toward Harry, his boyish grin back in place.\\n\\n\"Harry!\" he said. \"How are you? Been hoping to run into you! Everything going all right?\"\\n\\n\"Fine, thanks,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Wonder if I could have a quick, private word, Harry?\" said Bagman eagerly.\\n\\n\"You couldn\\'t give us a moment, you two, could you?\"\\n\\n\"Er � okay,\" said Ron, and he and Hermione went off to find a table.\\n\\nBagman led Harry along the bar to the end furthest from Madam Rosmerta.\\n\\n\"Well, I just thought I\\'d congratulate you again on your splendid performance against that Horntail, Harry,\" said Bagman. \"Really superb.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, but he knew this couldn\\'t be all that Bagman wanted to say, because he could have congratulated Harry in front of Ron and Hermione.\\n\\nBagman didn\\'t seem in any particular rush to spill the beans, though. Harry saw him glance into the mirror over the bar at the goblins, who were all watching him and Harry in silence through their dark, slanting eyes.\\n\\n\"Absolute nightmare,\" said Bagman to Harry in an undertone, noticing Harry watching the goblins too. \"Their English isn\\'t too good . . . it\\'s like being back with all the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup . . . but at least they used sign language another human could recognize. This lot keep gabbling in Gobblede� gook . . . and I only know one word of Gobbledegook. Bladvak. It means \\'pickax.\\' I don\\'t like to use it in case they think I\\'m threatening them.\"\\n\\nHe gave a short, booming laugh.\\n\\n\"What do they want?\" Harry said, noticing how the goblins were still watching Bagman very closely.\\n\\n\"Er � well. . .\" said Bagman, looking suddenly nervous. \"They ... er ... they\\'re looking for Barty Crouch.\"\\n\\n\"Why are they looking for him here?\" said Harry. \"He\\'s at the Ministry in London, isn\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\"Er ... as a matter of fact, I\\'ve no idea where he is,\" said Bagman. \"He\\'s sort of...\\n\\nstopped coming to work. Been absent for a couple of weeks now. Young Percy, his assistant, says he\\'s ill. Apparently he\\'s just been sending instructions in by owl.\\n\\nBut would you mind not mentioning that to anyone. Harry? Because Rita Skeeter\\'s still poking around everywhere she can, and I\\'m willing to bet she\\'d work up Bartys illness into something sinister. Probably say he\\'s gone missing like Bertha Jorkins.\"\\n\\n\"Have you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins?\" Harry asked.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Bagman, looking strained again. \"I\\'ve got people looking, of course ...\"\\n\\n(About time, thought Harry) \"and it\\'s all very strange. She definitely arrived in Albania, because she met her second cousin there. And then she left the cousin\\'s house to go south and see an aunt. . . and she seems to have vanished without trace en route. Blowed if I can see where she\\'s got to ... she doesn\\'t seem the type to elope, for instance . . . but still. . . . What are we doing, talking about goblins and Bertha Jorkins? I really wanted to ask you\" � he lowered his voice � \"how are you getting on with your golden egg?\"\\n\\n\"Er . . . not bad,\" Harry said untruthfully.\\n\\nBagman seemed to know he wasn\\'t being honest.\\n\\n\"Listen, Harry,\" he said (still in a very low voice), \"I feel very bad about all this . .\\n\\n. you were thrown into this tournament, you didn\\'t volunteer for it... and if. . .\" (his voice was so quiet now, Harry had to lean closer to listen) \"if I can help at all... a prod in the right direction . . . I\\'ve taken a liking to you . . . the way you got past that dragon! . . . well, just say the word.\"\\n\\nHarry stared up into Bagman\\'s round, rosy face and his wide, baby�blue eyes.\\n\\n\"We\\'re supposed to work out the clues alone, aren\\'t we?\" he said, careful to keep his voice casual and not sound as though he was accusing the head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports of breaking the rules.\\n\\n\"Well. . . well, yes,\" said Bagman impatiently, \"but � come on. Harry � we all want a Hogwarts victory, don\\'t we?\"\\n\\n\"Have you offered Cedric help?\" Harry said.\\n\\nThe smallest of frowns creased Bagman\\'s smooth face. \"No, I haven\\'t,\" he said. \"I � well, like I say, I\\'ve taken a liking to you. Just thought I\\'d offer ...\"\\n\\n\"Well, thanks,\" said Harry, \"but I think I\\'m nearly there with the egg . . . couple more days should crack it.\"\\n\\nHe wasn\\'t entirely sure why he was refusing Bagman\\'s help, except that Bagman\\n\\nwas almost a stranger to him, and accepting his assistance would feel somehow much more like cheating than asking advice from Ron, Hermione, or Sirius.\\n\\nBagman looked almost affronted, but couldn\\'t say much more as Fred and George turned up at that point.\\n\\n\"Hello, Mr. Bagman,\" said Fred brightly. \"Can we buy you a drink?\"\\n\\n\"Er . . . no,\" said Bagman, with a last disappointed glance at Harry, \"no, thank you, boys ...\"\\n\\nFred and George looked quite as disappointed as Bagman, who was surveying Harry as though he had let him down badly.\\n\\n\"Well, I must dash,\" he said. \"Nice seeing you all. Good luck, Harry.\"\\n\\nHe hurried out of the pub. The goblins all slid off their chairs and exited after him.\\n\\nHarry went to rejoin Ron and Hermione.\\n\\n\"What did he want?\" Ron said, the moment Harry had sat down.\\n\\n\"He offered to help me with the golden egg,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"He shouldn\\'t be doing that!\" said Hermione, looking very shocked. \"He\\'s one of the judges! And anyway, you\\'ve already worked it out � haven\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Er . . . nearly,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t think Dumbledore would like it if he knew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat!\" said Hermione, still looking deeply disapproving. \"I hope he\\'s trying to help Cedric as much!\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s not, I asked,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Who cares if Diggorys getting help?\" said Ron. Harry privately agreed.\\n\\n\"Those goblins didn\\'t look very friendly,\" said Hermione, sipping her butterbeer.\\n\\n\"What were they doing here?\"\\n\\n\"Looking for Crouch, according to Bagman,\" said Harry. \"He\\'s still ill. Hasn\\'t been into work.\"\\n\\n\"Maybe Percys poisoning him,\" said Ron. \"Probably thinks if Crouch snuffs it he\\'ll be made head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation.\"\\n\\nHermione gave Ron a don\\'t�joke�about�things�like�that look, and said, \"Funny, goblins looking for Mr. Crouch. . . . They\\'d normally deal with the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.\"\\n\\n\"Crouch can speak loads of different languages, though,\" said Harry. \"Maybe they need an interpreter.\"\\n\\n\"Worrying about poor \\'ickle goblins, now, are you?\" Ron asked Hermione.\\n\\n\"Thinking of starting up S.P.U.G. or something? Society for the Protection of Ugly Goblins?\"\\n\\n\"Ha, ha, ha,\" said Hermione sarcastically. \"Goblins don\\'t need protection. Haven\\'t you been listening to what Professor Binns has been telling us about goblin rebellions?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry and Ron together.\\n\\n\"Well, the/re quite capable of dealing with wizards,\" said Hermione, taking another sip of butterbeer. \"They\\'re very clever. They\\'re not like house�elves, who never stick up for themselves.\"\\n\\n\"Uh�oh,\" said Ron, staring at the door.\\n\\nRita Skeeter had just entered. She was wearing banana�yellow robes today; her long nails were painted shocking pink, and she was accompanied by her paunchy photographer. She bought drinks, and she and the photographer made their way through the crowds to a table nearby. Harry, Ron, and Hermione glaring at her as she approached. She was talking fast and looking very satisfied about something.\\n\\n\"... didn\\'t seem very keen to talk to us, did he, Bozo? Now, why would that be, do you think? And what\\'s he doing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway? Showing them the sights . .. what nonsense ... he was always a bad liar. Reckon something\\'s up? Think we should do a bit of digging? \\'Disgraced Ex�Head of Magical Games and Sports, Ludo Bagman . . .\\' Snappy start to a sentence, Bozo � we just need to find a story to fit it �\"\\n\\n\"Trying to ruin someone else\\'s life?\" said Harry loudly.\\n\\nA few people looked around. Rita Skeeter\\'s eyes widened behind her jeweled spectacles as she saw who had spoken.\\n\\n\"Harry!\" she said, beaming. \"How lovely! Why don\\'t you come and join� ?\"\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t come near you with a ten�foot broomstick,\" said Harry furiously.\\n\\n\"What did you do that to Hagrid for, eh?\"\\n\\nRita Skeeter raised her heavily penciled eyebrows.\\n\\n\"Our readers have a right to the truth, Harry. I am merely doing my�\"\\n\\n\"Who cares if he\\'s half�giant?\" Harry shouted. \"There\\'s nothing wrong with him!\"\\n\\nThe whole pub had gone very quiet. Madam Rosmerta was staring over from behind the bar, apparently oblivious to the fact that the flagon she was filling with mead was overflowing.\\n\\nRita Skeeters smile flickered very slightly, but she hitched it back almost at once; she snapped open her crocodile�skin handbag, pulled out her Quick�Quotes Quill,\\n\\nand said, \"How about giving me an interview about the Hagrid you know. Harry!\\n\\nThe man behind the muscles? Your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it.\\n\\nWould you call him a father substitute?\"\\n\\nHermione stood up very abruptly, her butterbeer clutched in her hand as though it were a grenade.\\n\\n\"You horrible woman,\" she said, through gritted teeth, \"you don\\'t care, do you, anything for a story, and anyone will do, wont they? Even Ludo Bagman �\"\\n\\n\"Sit down, you silly little girl, and don\\'t talk about things you don\\'t understand,\"\\n\\nsaid Rita Skeeter coldly, her eyes hardening as they fell on Hermione. \"I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl... not that it needs it �\"\\n\\nshe added, eyeing Hermione\\'s bushy hair.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s go,\" said Hermione, \"c\\'mon. Harry � Ron . ..\"\\n\\nThey left; many people were staring at them as they went. Harry glanced back as they reached the door. Rita Skeeter\\'s Quick�Quotes Quill was out; it was zooming backward and forward over a piece of parchment on the table.\\n\\n\"She\\'ll be after you next, Hermione,\" said Ron in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the street.\\n\\n\"Let her try!\" said Hermione defiantly; she was shaking with rage. \"I\\'ll show her!\\n\\nSilly little girl, am I? Oh, I\\'ll get her back for this. First Harry, then Hagrid ...\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter,\" said Ron nervously. \"I\\'m serious, Hermione, she\\'ll dig up something on you �\"\\n\\n\"My parents don\\'t read the Daily Prophet. She can\\'t scare me into hiding!\" said Hermione, now striding along so fast that it was all Harry and Ron could do to keep up with her. The last time Harry had seen Hermione in a rage like this, she had hit Draco Malfoy around the face. \"And Hagrid isn\\'t hiding anymore! He should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him! Come on!\"\\n\\nBreaking into a run, she led them all the way back up the road, through the gates flanked by winged boars, and up through the grounds to Hagrid\\'s cabin.\\n\\nThe curtains were still drawn, and they could hear Fang barking as they approached.\\n\\n\"Hagrid!\" Hermione shouted, pounding on his front door. \"Hagrid, that\\'s enough!\\n\\nWe know you\\'re in there! Nobody cares if your mum was a giantess, Hagrid! You can\\'t let that foul Skeeter woman do this to you! Hagrid, get out here, you\\'re just being �\"\\n\\nThe door opened. Hermione said, \"About t�!\" and then stopped, very suddenly, because she had found herself face�to�face, not with Hagrid, but with Albus Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"Good afternoon,\" he said pleasantly, smiling down at them.\\n\\n\"We�er�we wanted to see Hagrid,\" said Hermione in a rather small voice.\\n\\n\"Yes, I surmised as much,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. \"Why don\\'t you come in?\"\\n\\n\"Oh . . . um ... okay,\" said Hermione.\\n\\nShe, Ron, and Harry went into the cabin; Fang launched himself upon Harry the moment he entered, barking madly and trying to lick his ears. Harry fended off Fang and looked around.\\n\\nHagrid was sitting at his table, where there were two large mugs of tea. He looked a real mess. His face was blotchy, his eyes swollen, and he had gone to the other extreme where his hair was concerned; far from trying to make it behave, it now looked like a wig of tangled wire.\\n\\n\"Hi, Hagrid,\" said Harry.\\n\\nHagrid looked up.\\n\\n\"\\'Lo,\" he said in a very hoarse voice.\\n\\n\"More tea, I think,\" said Dumbledore, closing the door behind Harry, Ron, and Hermione, drawing out his wand, and twiddling it; a revolving tea tray appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes. Dumbledore magicked the tray onto the table, and everybody sat down. There was a slight pause, and then Dumbledore said, \"Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting, Hagrid?\"\\n\\nHermione went slightly pink, but Dumbledore smiled at her and continued, \"Hermione, Harry, and Ron still seem to want to know you, judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door.\"\\n\\n\"Of course we still want to know you!\" Harry said, staring at Hagrid. \"You don\\'t think anything that Skeeter cow � sorry, Professor,\" he added quickly, looking at Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"I have gone temporarily deaf and haven\\'t any idea what you said. Harry,\" said Dumbledore, twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ceiling.\\n\\n\"Er�right,\" said Harry sheepishly. \"I just meant�Hagrid, how could you think we\\'d care what that�woman�wrote about you?\"\\n\\nTwo fat tears leaked out of Hagrid\\'s beetle�black eyes and fell slowly into his tangled beard.\\n\\n\"Living proof of what I\\'ve been telling you, Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, still looking carefully up at the ceiling. \"I have shown you the letters from the countless parents who remember you from their own days here, telling me in no uncertain terms that if I sacked you, they would have something to say about it �\"\\n\\n\"Not all of \\'em,\" said Hagrid hoarsely. \"Not all of \\'em wan me ter stay.\"\\n\\n\"Really, Hagrid, if you are holding out for universal popularity, I\\'m afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time,\" said Dumbledore, now peering sternly over his half�moon spectacles. \"Not a week has passed since I became headmaster of this school when I haven\\'t had at least one owl complaining about the way I run it.\\n\\nBut what should I do? Barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybody?\"\\n\\n\"Yeh � yeh\\'re not half�giant!\" said Hagrid croakily.\\n\\n\"Hagrid, look what I\\'ve got for relatives!\" Harry said furiously. \"Look at the Dursleys!\"\\n\\n\"An excellent point,\" said Professor Dumbledore. \"My own brother, Aberforth, was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat. It was all over the papers, but did Aberforth hide? No, he did not! He held his head high and went about his business as usual! Of course, I\\'m not entirely sure he can read, so that may not have been bravery. . ..\"\\n\\n\"Come back and teach, Hagrid,\" said Hermione quietly, \"please come back, we really miss you.\"\\n\\nHagrid gulped. More tears leaked out down his cheeks and into his tangled beard.\\n\\nDumbledore stood up. \"I refuse to accept your resignation, Hagrid, and I expect you back at work on Monday,\" he said. \"You will join me for breakfast at eight� thirty in the Great Hall. No excuses. Good afternoon to you all.\"\\n\\nDumbledore left the cabin, pausing only to scratch Fangs ears. When the door had shut behind him, Hagrid began to sob into his dustbin�lid�sized hands. Hermione kept patting his arm, and at last, Hagrid looked up, his eyes very red indeed, and said, \"Great man, Dumbledore . . . great man . ..\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, he is,\" said Ron. \"Can I have one of these cakes, Hagrid?\"\\n\\n\"Help yerself,\" said Hagrid, wiping his eyes on the back of his hand. \"Ar, he\\'s righ\\', o\\' course � yeh\\'re all righ\\' . . .I bin stupid . .. my ol\\' dad woulda bin ashamed o\\' the way I\\'ve bin behavin\\'....\" More tears leaked out, but he wiped them away more forcefully, and said, \"Never shown you a picture of my old dad, have I!\\n\\nHere...\"\\n\\nHagrid got up, went over to his dresser, opened a drawer, and pulled out a picture of a short wizard with Hagrid\\'s crinkled black eyes, beaming as he sat on top of Hagrid\\'s shoulder. Hagrid was a good seven or eight feet tall, judging by the apple tree beside him, but his face was beardless, young, round, and smooth � he looked hardly older than eleven.\\n\\n\"Tha was taken jus\\' after I got inter Hogwarts,\" Hagrid croaked. \"Dad was dead chuffed ... thought I migh\\' not be a wizard, see, \\'cos me mum ... well, anyway.\\n\\n\\'Course, I never was great shakes at magic, really... but at least he never saw me expelled. Died, see, in me second year. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after Dad went. Got me the gamekeeper job . . . trusts people, he does. Gives \\'em second chances ... tha\\'s what sets him apar\\' from other heads, see. He\\'ll accept anyone at Hogwarts, s\\'long as they\\'ve got the talent. Knows people can turn out okay even if their families weren\\' ... well... all tha\\' respectable. But some don understand that. There\\'s some who\\'d always hold it against yeh . . . there\\'s some who\\'d even pretend they just had big bones rather than stand up an\\' say � I am what I am, an\\' I\\'m not ashamed. \\'Never be ashamed,\\' my ol\\' dad used ter say, \\'there\\'s some who\\'ll hold it against you, but they\\'re not worth botherin\\' with.\\' An\\' he was right. I\\'ve bin an idiot. I\\'m not botherin\\' with her no more, I promise yeh that. Big bones . . . I\\'ll give her big bones.\"\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another nervously; Harry would rather have taken fifty Blast�Ended Skrewts for a walk than admit to Hagrid that he had overheard him talking to Madame Maxime, but Hagrid was still talking, apparently unaware that he had said anything odd.\\n\\n\"Yeh know wha, Harry?\" he said, looking up from the photograph of his father, his eyes very bright, \"when I firs\\' met you, you reminded me o\\' me a bit. Mum an\\' Dad gone, an\\' you was feelin\\' like yeh wouldn\\' fit in at Hogwarts, remember? Not sure yeh were really up to it... an\\' now look at yeh, Harry! School champion!\"\\n\\nHe looked at Harry for a moment and then said, very seriously, \"Yeh know what I\\'d love. Harry? I\\'d love yeh ter win, I really would. It\\'d show \\'em all... yeh don\\' have ter be pureblood ter do it. Yeh don have ter be ashamed of what yeh are. It\\'d show \\'em Dumbledore\\'s the one who\\'s got it righ\\', lettin\\' anyone in as long as they can do magic. How you doin\\' with that egg, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"Great,\" said Harry. \"Really great.\"\\n\\nHagrid\\'s miserable face broke into a wide, watery smile.\\n\\n\"Tha\\'s my boy. . . you show \\'em, Harry, you show \\'em. Beat \\'em all.\"\\n\\nLying to Hagrid wasn\\'t quite like lying to anyone else. Harry went back to the castle later that afternoon with Ron and Hermione, unable to banish the image of the happy expression on Hagrid\\'s whiskery face as he had imagined Harry winning the tournament. The incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than ever on Harrys conscience that evening, and by the time he had got into bed, he had made up his mind � it was time to shelve his pride and see if Cedric\\'s hint was worth anything.\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY�FIVE � THE EGG AND THE EYE\\n\\nHarry had no idea how long a bath he would need to work out the secret of the golden egg, he decided to do it at night, when he would be able to take as much time as he wanted. Reluctant though he was to accept more favors from Cedric, he also decided to use the prefects\\' bathroom; far fewer people were allowed in there, so it was much less likely that he would be disturbed.\\n\\nHarry planned his excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of bed and out�of�bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once before, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he would take the Marauders Map, which, next to the cloak, was the most useful aid to rule�breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most important of all, it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule, labeled dots, moving around the corridors, so that Harry would be forewarned if somebody was approaching the bathroom.\\n\\nOn Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the cloak, crept back downstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown him the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open. This time it was Ron who waited outside to give the Fat Lady the password (\"banana fritters\"), \"Good luck,\" Ron muttered, climbing into the room as Harry crept out past him.\\n\\nIt was awkward moving under the cloak tonight, because Harry had the heavy egg under one arm and the map held in front of his nose with the other. However, the moonlit corridors were empty and silent, and by checking the map at strategic intervals, Harry was able to ensure that he wouldn\\'t run into anyone he wanted to avoid. When he reached the statue of Boris the Bewildered, a lost�looking wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands, he located the right door, leaned close to it, and muttered the password, \"Pine fresh,\" just as Cedric had told him.\\n\\nThe door creaked open. Harry slipped inside, bolted the door behind him, and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, looking around.\\n\\nHis immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a prefect just to be able to use this bathroom. It was softly lit by a splendid candle�filled chandelier, and everything was made of white marble, including what looked like an empty, rectangular swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor. About a hundred golden taps stood all around the pools edges, each with a differently colored Jewel set into its handle. There was also a diving board. Long white linen curtains hung at the windows; a large pile of fluffy white towels sat in a corner, and there was a single golden�framed painting on the wall. It featured a blonde mermaid who was fast asleep on a rock, her long hair over her face. It fluttered every time she\\n\\nsnored.\\n\\nHarry moved forward, looking around, his footsteps echoing off the walls.\\n\\nMagnificent though the bathroom was � and quite keen though he was to try out a few of those taps � now he was here he couldn\\'t quite suppress the feeling that Cedric might have been having him on. How on earth was this supposed to help solve the mystery of the egg? Nevertheless, he put one of the Huffy towels, the cloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the swimming�pool�sized bath, then knelt down and turned on a few of the taps.\\n\\nHe could tell at once that they carried different sorts of bubble bath mixed with the water, though it wasn\\'t bubble bath as Harry had ever experienced it. One tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of footballs; another poured ice�white foam so thick that Harry thought it would have supported his weight if he\\'d cared to test it; a third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering over the surface of the water. Harry amused himself for awhile turning the taps on and off, particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs. Then, when the deep pool was full of hot water, foam, and bubbles, which took a very short time considering its size, Harry turned off all the taps, pulled off his pajamas, slippers, and dressing gown, and slid into the water.\\n\\nIt was so deep that his feet barely touched the bottom, and he actually did a couple of lengths before swimming back to the side and treading water, staring at the egg.\\n\\nHighly enjoyable though it was to swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of different�colored steam wafting all around him, no stroke of brilliance came to him, no sudden burst of understanding.\\n\\nHarry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet hands, and opened it. The wailing, screeching sound filled the bathroom, echoing and reverberating off the marble walls, but it sounded just as incomprehensible as ever, if not more so with all the echoes. He snapped it shut again, worried that the sound would attract Filch, wondering whether that hadn\\'t been Cedric\\'s plan � and then, making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg, which clattered away across the bathroom floor, someone spoke.\\n\\n\"I\\'d try putting it in the water, if I were you.\"\\n\\nHarry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock. He stood up, sputtering, and saw the ghost of a very glum�looking girl sitting cross�legged on top of one of the taps. It was Moaning Myrtle, who was usually to be heard sobbing in the S�bend of a toilet three floors below.\\n\\n\"Myrtle!\" Harry said in outrage, \"I\\'m � I\\'m not wearing anything!\"\\n\\nThe foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but he had a nasty feeling that Myrtle had been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since he had arrived.\\n\\n\"I closed my eyes when you got in,\" she said, blinking at him through her thick\\n\\nspectacles. \"You haven\\'t been to see me for ages.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah . . . well. . .\" said Harry, bending his knees slightly, just to make absolutely sure Myrtle couldn\\'t see anything but his head, \"I\\'m not supposed to come into your bathroom, am I? It\\'s a girls\\' one.\"\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t used to care,\" said Myrtle miserably. \"You used to be in there all the time.\"\\n\\nThis was true, though only because Harry, Ron, and Hermione had found Myrtle\\'s out�of�order toilets a convenient place to brew Polyjuice Potion in secret � a forbidden potion that had turned him and Ron into living replicas of Crabbe and Goyle for an hour, so that they could sneak into the Slytherin common room.\\n\\n\"I got told off for going in there.\" said Harry, which was half�true; Percy had once caught him coming out of Myrtles bathroom. \"I thought I\\'d better not come back after that.\"\\n\\n\"Oh ... I see ...\" said Myrtle, picking at a spot on her chin in a morose sort of way.\\n\\n\"Well... anyway... I\\'d try the egg in the water. That\\'s what Cedric Diggory did.\"\\n\\n\"Have you been spying on him too?\" said Harry indignantly. \"What d\\'you do, sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths?\"\\n\\n\"Sometimes,\" said Myrtle, rather slyly, \"but I\\'ve never come out to speak to anyone before.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m honored,\" said Harry darkly. \"You keep your eyes shut!\"\\n\\nHe made sure Myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoisting himself out of the bath, wrapping the towel firmly around his waist, and going to retrieve the egg.\\n\\nOnce he was back in the water, Myrtle peered through her fingers and said, \"Go on, then . .. open it under the water!\"\\n\\nHarry lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and opened it... and this time, it did not wail. A gurgling song was coming out of it, a song whose words he couldnt distinguish through the water.\\n\\n\"You need to put your head under too,\" said Myrtle, who seemed to be thoroughly enjoying bossing him around. \"Go on!\"\\n\\nHarry took a great breath and slid under the surface � and now, sitting on the marble bottom of the bubble�filled bath, he heard a chorus of eerie voices singing to him from the open egg in his hands: \"Come seek us where our voices sound, We cannot sing above the ground, And while you re searching, ponder this:\\n\\nWove taken what you\\'ll sorely miss, An hour long you\\'ll have to look, And to recover what we took, But past an hour� the prospect\\'s black, Too late, it\\'s gone, it wont come back\"\\n\\nHarry let himself float back upward and broke the bubbly surface, shaking his hair out of his eyes.\\n\\n\"Hear it?\" said Myrtle.\\n\\n\"Yeah ... \\'Come seek us where our voices sound .. .\\' and if I need persuading ...\\n\\nhang on, I need to listen again....\"\\n\\nHe sank back beneath the water. It took three more underwater renditions of the egg\\'s song before Harry had it memorized; then he trod water for a while, thinking hard, while Myrtle sat and watched him.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got to go and look for people who can\\'t use their voices above the ground. . .\\n\\n.\" he said slowly. \"Er . . . who could that be?\"\\n\\n\"Slow, aren\\'t you?\"\\n\\nHe had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a dose of PolyJuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat. Harry stared around the bathroom, thinking ... if the voices could only be heard underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to underwater creatures. He ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked at him.\\n\\n\"Well, thats what Diggory thought,\" she said. \"He lay there talking to himself for ages about it. Ages and ages . . . nearly all the bubbles had gone. ...\"\\n\\n\"Underwater ...\" Harry said slowly. \"Myrtle . . . what lives in the lake, apart from the giant squid?\"\\n\\n\"Oh all sorts,\" she said. \"I sometimes go down there . . . sometimes don\\'t have any choice, if someone flushes my toilet when I\\'m not expecting it....\"\\n\\nTrying not to think about Moaning Myrtle zooming down a pipe to the lake with the contents of a toilet. Harry said, \"Well, does anything in there have a human voice? Hang on �\"\\n\\nHarry\\'s eyes had fallen on the picture of the snoozing mermaid on the wall.\\n\\n\"Myrtle, there aren\\'t merpeople in there, are there?\"\\n\\n\"Oooh, very good,\" she said, her thick glasses twinkling, \"it took Diggory much longer than that! And that was with her awake too\" � Myrtle jerked her head\\n\\ntoward the mermaid with an expression of great dislike on her glum face � \"giggling and showing off and flashing her fins.. ..\"\\n\\n\"Thats it, isn\\'t it?\" said Harry excitedly. \"The second tasks to go and find the merpeople in the lake and ... and ...\"\\n\\nBut he suddenly realized what he was saying, and he felt the excitement drain out of him as though someone had just pulled a plug in his stomach. He wasn\\'t a very good swimmer; he\\'d never had much practice. Dudley had had lessons in his youth, but Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, no doubt hoping that Harry would drown one day, hadn\\'t bothered to give him any. A couple of lengths of this bath were all very well, but that lake was very large, and very deep . . . and merpeople would surely live right at the bottom. . . .\\n\\n\"Myrtle,\" Harry said slowly, \"how am I supposed to breathe?\"\\n\\nAt this, Myrtle\\'s eyes filled with sudden tears again.\\n\\n\"Tactless!\" she muttered, groping in her robes for a handkerchief.\\n\\n\"What\\'s tactless?\" said Harry, bewildered.\\n\\n\"Talking about breathing in front of me!\" she said shrilly, and her voice echoed loudly around the bathroom. \"When I can\\'t. . . when I haven\\'t. . . not for ages ...\"\\n\\nShe buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly. Harry remembered how touchy Myrtle had always been about being dead, but none of the other ghosts he knew made such a fuss about it.\\n\\n\"Sorry,\" he said impatiently. \"I didn\\'t mean � I just forgot. . .\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes, very easy to forget Myrtle\\'s dead,\" said Myrtle, gulping, looking at him out of swollen eyes. \"Nobody missed me even when I was alive. Took them hours and hours to find my body � I know, I was sitting there waiting for them. Olive Hornby came into the bathroom � Are you in here again, sulking, Myrtle?\\' she said, \\'because Professor Dippet asked me to look for you �\\' And then she saw my body . . . ooooh, she didn\\'t forget it until her dying day, I made sure of that...\\n\\nfollowed her around and reminded her, I did. I remember at her brother\\'s wedding �\"\\n\\nBut Harry wasn\\'t listening; he was thinking about the merpeople\\'s song again.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve taken what you II sorely miss.\" That sounded as though they were going to steal something of his, something he had to get back. What were they going to take!\\n\\n\"��and then, of course, she went to the Ministry of Magic to stop me stalking her, so I had to come back here and live in my toilet.\"\\n\\n\"Good,\" said Harry vaguely. \"Well, I\\'m a lot further on than I was. . . . Shut your eyes again, will you? I\\'m getting out.\"\\n\\nHe retrieved the egg from the bottom of the bath, climbed out, dried himself, and pulled on his pajamas and dressing gown again.\\n\\n\"Will you come and visit me in my bathroom again sometime?\" Moaning Myrtle asked mournfully as Harry picked up the Invisibility Cloak.\\n\\n\"Er . . . I\\'ll try,\" Harry said, though privately thinking the only way he\\'d be visiting Myrtle\\'s bathroom again was if every other toilet in the castle got blocked. \"See you. Myrtle... thanks for your help.\"\\n\\n\"Bye, \\'bye,\" she said gloomily, and as Harry put on the Invisibllity Cloak he saw her zoom back up the tap.\\n\\nOut in the dark corridor, Harry examined the Marauders Map to check that the coast was still clear. Yes, the dots belonging to Filch and his cat, Mrs. Norris, were safely in their office . .. nothing else seemed to be moving apart from Peeves, though he was bouncing around the trophy room on the floor above. ... Harry had taken his first step back toward Gryffindor Tower when something else on the map caught his eye . . . something distinctly odd.\\n\\nPeeves was not the only thing that was moving. A single dot was flitting around a room in the bottom left�hand corner � Snapes office. But the dot wasn\\'t labeled \"Severus Snape\" ... it was Bartemius Crouch.\\n\\nHarry stared at the dot. Mr. Crouch was supposed to be too ill to go to work or to come to the Yule Ball � so what was he doing, sneaking into Hogwarts at one o\\'clock in the morning? Harry watched closely as the dot moved around and around the room, pausing here and there. ...\\n\\nHarry hesitated, thinking . . . and then his curiosity got the better of him. He turned and set off in the opposite direction toward the nearest staircase. He was going to see what Crouch was up to.\\n\\nHarry walked down the stairs as quietly as possible, though the faces in some of the portraits still turned curiously at the squeak of a floorboard, the rustle of his pajamas. He crept along the corridor below, pushed aside a tapestry about halfway along, and proceeded down a narrower staircase, a shortcut that would take him down two floors. He kept glancing down at the map, wondering ... It just didn\\'t seem in character, somehow, for correct, law�abiding Mr. Crouch to be sneaking around somebody else\\'s office this late at night....\\n\\nAnd then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking about what he was doing, not concentrating on anything but the peculiar behavior of Mr. Crouch, Harrys leg suddenly sank right through the trick step Neville always forgot to jump. He gave an ungainly wobble, and the golden egg, still damp from the bath, slipped from under his arm. He lurched forward to try and catch it, but too late; the egg fell down the long staircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on every step � the Invisibility Cloak slipped � Harry snatched at it, and the Marauder s Map fluttered out of his hand and slid down six stairs, where, sunk in the step to above his knee,\\n\\nhe couldn\\'t reach it.\\n\\nThe golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the staircase, burst open, and began wailing loudly in the corridor below. Harry pulled out his wand and struggled to touch the Marauder s Map, to wipe it blank, but it was too far away to reach � Pulling the cloak back over himself Harry straightened up, listening hard with his eyes screwed up with fear. . . and, almost immediately � \"PEEVES!\"\\n\\nIt was the unmistakable hunting cry of Filch the caretaker. Harry could hear his rapid, shuffling footsteps coming nearer and nearer, his wheezy voice raised in fury.\\n\\n\"What\\'s this racket? Wake up the whole castle, will you? I\\'ll have you, Peeves, I\\'ll have you, you\\'ll... and what is this?\"\\n\\nFilch\\'s footsteps halted; there was a clink of metal on metal and the wailing stopped � Filch had picked up the egg and closed it. Harry stood very still, one leg still Jammed tightly in the magical step, listening. Any moment now, Filch was going to pull aside the tapestry, expecting to see Peeves . . . and there would be no Peeves ... but if he came up the stairs, he would spot the Marauder\\'s Map . . . and Invisibility Cloak or not, the map would show \"Harry Potter\" standing exactly where he was.\\n\\n\"Egg?\" Filch said quietly at the foot of the stairs. \"My sweet!\" � Mrs. Norris was obviously with him � \"This is a Triwizard clue! This belongs to a school champion!\"\\n\\nHarry felt sick; his heart was hammering very fast � \"PEEVES!\" Filch roared gleefully. \"You\\'ve been stealing!\"\\n\\nHe ripped back the tapestry below, and Harry saw his horrible, pouchy face and bulging, pale eyes staring up the dark and (to Filch) deserted staircase.\\n\\n\"Hiding, are you?\" he said softly. \"I\\'m coming to get you, Peeves. . . . You\\'ve gone and stolen a Triwizard clue, Peeves... . Dumbledore\\'ll have you out of here for this, you filthy, pilfering poltergeist. ...\"\\n\\nFilch started to climb the stairs, his scrawny, dust�colored cat at his heels. Mrs.\\n\\nMorris\\'s lamp�like eyes, so very like her masters, were fixed directly upon Harry.\\n\\nHe had had occasion before now to wonder whether the Invisibility Cloak worked on cats. . . . Sick with apprehension, he watched Filch drawing nearer and nearer in his old flannel dressing gown � he tried desperately to pull his trapped leg free, but it merely sank a few more inches � any second now, Filch was going to spot the map or walk right into him �\\n\\n\"Filch? Whats going on?\"\\n\\nFilch stopped a few steps below Harry and turned. At the foot of the stairs stood the only person who could make Harry\\'s situation worse: Snape. He was wearing a long gray nightshirt and he looked livid.\\n\\n\"Its Peeves, Professor,\" Filch whispered malevolently. \"He threw this egg down the stairs.\"\\n\\nSnape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped beside Filch. Harry gritted his teeth, convinced his loudly thumping heart would give him away at any second. . .\\n\\n.\\n\\n\"Peeves?\" said Snape softly, staring at the egg in Filch\\'s hands. \"But Peeves couldn\\'t get into my office. . . .\"\\n\\n\"This egg was in your office. Professor?\"\\n\\n\"Of course not,\" Snape snapped. \"I heard banging and wailing �\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Professor, that was the egg �\"\\n\\n\"� I was coming to investigate �\"\\n\\n\"� Peeves threw it. Professor �\"\\n\\n\"� and when I passed my office, I saw that the torches were lit and a cupboard door was ajar! Somebody has been searching it!\"\\n\\nBut Peeves couldn\\'t �\"\\n\\n\"I know he couldn\\'t, Filch!\" Snape snapped again. \"I seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break!\" Snape looked up the stairs, straight through Harry, and then down into the corridor below. \"I want you to come and help me search for the intruder, Filch.\"\\n\\n\"I � yes, Professor � but �\"\\n\\nFilch looked yearningly up the stairs, right through Harry, who could see that he was very reluctant to forgo the chance of cornering Peeves. Go, Harry pleaded with him silently, go with Snape . . . go. . . Mrs. Norris was peering around Filch\\'s legs.... Harry had the distinct impression that she could smell him.. . . Why had he filled that bath with so much perfumed foam!\\n\\n\"The thing is, Professor,\" said Filch plaintively, \"the headmaster will have to listen to me this time. Peeves has been stealing from a student, it might be my chance to get him thrown out of the castle once and for all �\"\\n\\n\"Filch, I don\\'t give a damn about that wretched poltergeist; it\\'s my office that\\'s �\"\\n\\nClunk. Clunk. Clunk.\\n\\nSnape stopped talking very abruptly. He and Filch both looked down at the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Mad�Eye Moody limp into sight through the narrow gap between their heads. Moody was wearing his old traveling cloak over his nightshirt and leaning on his staff as usual.\\n\\n\"Pajama party, is it?\" he growled up the stairs.\\n\\n\"Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor,\" said Filch at once. \"Peeves the Poltergeist, throwing things around as usual � and then Professor Snape discovered that someone had broken into his off �\"\\n\\n\"Shut up!\" Snape hissed to Filch.\\n\\nMoody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Moodys magical eye travel over Snape, and then, unmistakably, onto himself.\\n\\nHarrys heart gave a horrible jolt. Moody could see through Invisibility Cloaks... he alone could see the full strangeness of the scene: Snape in his nightshirt, Filch clutching the egg, and he, Harry, trapped in the stairs behind them. Moody\\'s lopsided gash of a mouth opened in surprise. For a few seconds, he and Harry stared straight into each other\\'s eyes. Then Moody closed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon Snape again.\\n\\n\"Did I hear that correctly, Snape?\" he asked slowly. \"Someone broke into your office?\"\\n\\n\"It is unimportant,\" said Snape coldly. \"On the contrary,\" growled Moody, \"it is very important. Who\\'d want to break into your office?\"\\n\\n\"A student, I daresay,\" said Snape. Harry could see a vein flickering horribly on Snape\\'s greasy temple. \"It has happened before. Potion ingredients have gone missing from my private store cupboard ... students attempting illicit mixtures, no doubt....\"\\n\\n\"Reckon they were after potion ingredients, eh?\" said Moody. \"Not hiding anything else in your office, are you?\"\\n\\nHarry saw the edge of Snapes sallow face turn a nasty brick color, the vein in his temple pulsing more rapidly.\\n\\n\"You know I\\'m hiding nothing, Moody,\" he said in a soft and dangerous voice, \"as you\\'ve searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself.\"\\n\\nMoodys face twisted into a smile. \"Auror\\'s privilege, Snape. Dumbledore told me to keep an eye �\"\\n\\n\"Dumbledore happens to trust me,\" said Snape through clenched teeth. \"I refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my office!\"\\n\\n\"Course Dumbledore trusts you,\" growled Moody. \"Hes a trusting man, isn\\'t he!\\n\\nBelieves in second chances. But me � I say there are spots that don\\'t come off, Snape. Spots that never come off, d\\'you know what I mean?\"\\n\\nSnape suddenly did something very strange. He seized his left forearm convulsively with his right hand, as though something on it had hurt him.\\n\\nMoody laughed. \"Get back to bed, Snape.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t have the authority to send me anywhere!\" Snape hissed, letting go of his arm as though angry with himself. \"I have as much right to prowl this school after dark as you do!\"\\n\\n\"Prowl away,\" said Moody, but his voice was full of menace. \"I look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time.... You\\'ve dropped something, by the way. ...\"\\n\\nWith a stab of horror. Harry saw Moody point at the Marauders Map, still lying on the staircase six steps below him. As Snape and Filch both turned to look at it, Harry threw caution to the winds; he raised his arms under the cloak and waved furiously at Moody to attract his attention, mouthing \"It\\'s mine! Mine!\"\\n\\nSnape had reached out for it, a horrible expression of dawning comprehension on his face � \"Accio Parchment!\"\\n\\nThe map flew up into the air, slipped through Snapes outstretched fingers, and soared down the stairs into Moodys hand.\\n\\n\"My mistake,\" Moody said calmly. \"It\\'s mine � must\\'ve dropped it earlier �\"\\n\\nBut Snape\\'s black eyes were darting from the egg in Filch\\'s arms to the map in Moodys hand, and Harry could tell he was putting two and two together, as only Snape could. . . .\\n\\n\"Potter,\" he said quietly.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" said Moody calmly, folding up the map and pocketing it.\\n\\n\"Potter!\" Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at the place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him. \"That egg is Potters egg. That piece of parchment belongs to Potter. I have seen it before, I recognize it! Potter is here! Potter, in his Invisibility Cloak!\"\\n\\nSnape stretched out his hands like a blind man and began to move up the stairs; Harry could have sworn his over�large nostrils were dilating, trying to sniff Harry out � trapped. Harry leaned backward, trying to avoid Snapes fingertips, but any moment now� \"There\\'s nothing there, Snape!\" barked Moody, \"but I\\'ll be happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to Harry Potter!\"\\n\\n\"Meaning what?\" Snape turned again to look at Moody, his hands still outstretched, inches from Harry\\'s chest.\\n\\n\"Meaning that Dumbledore\\'s very interested to know who\\'s got it in for that boy!\"\\n\\nsaid Moody, limping nearer still to the foot of the stairs. \"And so am I, Snape . . .\\n\\nvery interested....\" The torchlight flickered across his mangled face, so that the scars, and the chunk missing from his nose, looked deeper and darker than ever.\\n\\nSnape was looking down at Moody, and Harry couldn\\'t see the expression on his face. For a moment, nobody moved or said anything. Then Snape slowly lowered his hands.\\n\\n\"I merely thought,\" said Snape, in a voice of forced calm, \"that if Potter was wandering around after hours again ... it\\'s an unfortunate habit of his ... he should be stopped. For � for his own safety.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, I see,\" said Moody softly. \"Got Potter\\'s best interests at heart, have you?\"\\n\\nThere was a pause. Snape and Moody were still staring at each other, Mrs. Norris gave a loud meow, still peering around Filch\\'s legs, looking for the source of Harry\\'s bubble�bath smell.\\n\\n\"I think I will go back to bed,\" Snape said curtly.\\n\\n\"Best idea you\\'ve had all night,\" said Moody. \"Now, Filch, if you\\'ll just give me that egg�\"\\n\\n\"No!\" said Filch, clutching the egg as though it were his firstborn son. \"Professor Moody, this is evidence of Peeves\\' treachery!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s the property of the champion he stole it from,\" said Moody. Hand it over, now.\"\\n\\nSnape swept downstairs and passed Moody without another word. Filch made a chirruping noise to Mrs. Norris, who stared blankly at Harry for a few more seconds before turning and following her master. Still breathing very fast. Harry heard Snape walking away down the corridor; Filch handed Moody the egg and disappeared from view too, muttering to Mrs. Norris. \"Never mind. my sweet.. .\\n\\nwe\\'ll see Dumbledore in the morning ... tell him what Peeves was up to....\"\\n\\nA door slammed. Harry was left staring down at Moody, who placed his staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward him, a dull clunk on every other step.\\n\\n\"Close shave. Potter,\" he muttered.\\n\\n\"Yeah ... I � er ... thanks,\" said Harry weakly.\\n\\n\"What is this thing?\" said Moody, drawing the Marauder\\'s Map out of his pocket\\n\\nand unfolding it.\\n\\n\"Map of Hogwarts,\" said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.\\n\\n\"Merlins beard,\" Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye going haywire. \"This . .. this is some map. Potter!\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, its . . . quite useful,\" Harry said. His eyes were starting to water from the pain. \"Er � Professor Moody, d\\'you think you could help me � ?\"\\n\\n\"What? Oh! Yes . . . yes, of course . ..\"\\n\\nMoody took hold of Harrys arms and pulled; Harrys leg came free of the trick step, and he climbed onto the one above it. Moody was still gazing at the map.\\n\\n\"Potter ...\" he said slowly, \"you didn\\'t happen, by any chance, to see who broke into Snapes office, did you? On this map, I mean?\"\\n\\n\"Er . . . yeah, I did . . .\" Harry admitted. \"It was Mr. Crouch.\"\\n\\nMoodys magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map. He looked suddenly alarmed.\\n\\n\"Crouch?\" he said. \"You\\'re � you\\'re sure. Potter?\"\\n\\n\"Positive,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Well, he\\'s not here anymore,\" said Moody, his eye still whizzing over the map.\\n\\n\"Crouch . .. that\\'s very � very interesting... .\"\\n\\nHe said nothing for almost a minute, still staring at the map. Harry could tell that this news meant something to Moody and very much wanted to know what it was.\\n\\nHe wondered whether he dared ask. Moody scared him slightly. . . yet Moody had just helped him avoid an awful lot of trouble. . . .\\n\\n\"Er ... Professor Moody . . . why d\\'you reckon Mr. Crouch wanted to look around Snapes office?\"\\n\\nMoodys magical eye left the map and fixed, quivering, upon Harry. It was a penetrating glare, and Harry had the impression that Moody was sizing him up, wondering whether to answer or not, or how much to tell him.\\n\\n\"Put it this way. Potter,\" Moody muttered finally, \"they say old Mad�Eye\\'s obsessed with catching Dark wizards . . . but I\\'m nothing � nothing � compared to Barty Crouch.\"\\n\\nHe continued to stare at the map. Harry was burning to know more.\\n\\n\"Professor Moody?\" he said again. \"D\\'you think... could this have anything to do with . . . maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there\\'s something going on. ...\"\\n\\n\"Like what?\" said Moody sharply.\\n\\nHarry wondered how much he dare say. He didn\\'t want Moody to guess that he had a source of information outside Hogwarts; that might lead to tricky questions about Sirius.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" Harry muttered, \"odd stuffs been happening lately, hasn\\'t it? It\\'s been in the Daily Prophet... the Dark Mark at the World Cup, and the Death Eaters and everything....\"\\n\\nBoth of Moody\\'s mismatched eyes widened.\\n\\n\"You\\'re a sharp boy. Potter,\" he said. His magical eye roved back to the Marauder\\'s Map. \"Crouch could be thinking along those lines,\" he said slowly.\\n\\n\"Very possible. . . there have been some funny rumors flying around lately � helped along by Rita Skeeter, of course. It\\'s making a lot of people nervous, I reckon.\" A grim smile twisted his lopsided mouth. \"Oh if there\\'s one thing I hate,\"\\n\\nhe muttered, more to himself than to Harry, and his magical eye was fixed on the left�hand corner of the map, \"its a Death Eater who walked free. ...\"\\n\\nHarry stared at him. Could Moody possibly mean what Harry thought he meant!\\n\\n\"And now I want to ask you a question. Potter,\" said Moody in a more businesslike tone.\\n\\nHarrys heart sank; he had thought this was coming. Moody was going to ask where he had got this map, which was a very dubious magical object � and the story of how it had fallen into his hands incriminated not only him, but his own father, Fred and George Weasley, and Professor Lupin, their last Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Moody waved the map in front of Harry, who braced himself� \"Can I borrow this?\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Harry.\\n\\nHe was very fond of his map, but on the other hand, he was extremely relieved that Moody wasn\\'t asking where he\\'d got it, and there was no doubt that he owed Moody a favor.\\n\\n\"Yeah, okay.\"\\n\\n\"Good boy,\" growled Moody. \"I can make good use of this . .. this might be exactly what I\\'ve been looking for. . . . Right, bed, Potter, come on, now. ...\"\\n\\nThey climbed to the top of the stairs together, Moody still examining the map as though it was a treasure the like of which he had never seen before. They walked in silence to the door of Moody\\'s office, where he stopped and looked up at Harry.\\n\\n\"You ever thought of a career as an Auror, Potter?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry, taken aback.\\n\\n\"You want to consider it,\" said Moody, nodding and looking at Harry thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed ... and incidentally ... I\\'m guessing you werent Just taking that egg for a walk tonight?\"\\n\\n\"Er � no,\" said Harry, grinning. \"I\\'ve been working out the clue.\"\\n\\nMoody winked at him, his magical eye going haywire again. \"Nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas, Potter. . .. See you in the morning....\"\\n\\nHe went back into his office, staring down at the Marauders Map again, and closed the door behind him.\\n\\nHarry walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in thought about Snape, and Crouch, and what it all meant.... Why was Crouch pretending to be ill, if he could manage to get to Hogwarts when he wanted to? What did he think Snape was concealing in his office!\\n\\nAnd Moody thought he. Harry, ought to be an Auror! Interesting idea.. . but somehow. Harry thought, as he got quietly into his four�poster ten minutes later, the egg and the cloak now safely back in his trunk, he thought he\\'d like to check how scarred the rest of them were before he chose it as a career.\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY�SIX � THE SECOND TASK\\n\\nYou said you\\'d already worked out that egg clue!\" said Hermione indignantly.\\n\\n\"Keep your voice down!\" said Harry crossly. \"I just need to � sort of fine�tune it, all right?\"\\n\\nHe, Ron, and Hermione were sitting at the very back of the Charms class with a table to themselves. They were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the Summoning Charm today � the Banishing Charm. Owing to the potential for nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room. Professor Flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practice, the theory being that these wouldn\\'t hurt anyone if they went off target. It was a good theory, but it wasn\\'t working very well. Neville\\'s aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room � Professor Flitwick, for instance.\\n\\n\"Just forget the egg for a minute, all right?\" Harry hissed as Professor Flitwick went whizzing resignedly past them, landing on top of a large cabinet. \"I\\'m trying to tell you about Snape and Moody. ...\"\\n\\nThis class was an ideal cover for a private conversation, as everyone was having far too much fun to pay them any attention. Harry had been recounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour.\\n\\n\"Snape said Moodys searched his office as well?\" Ron whispered, his eyes alight with interest as he Banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand (it soared into the air and knocked Parvati\\'s hat off). \"What. . . d\\'you reckon Moody\\'s here to keep an eye on Snape as well as Karkaroff?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I dunno if that\\'s what Dumbledore asked him to do, but he\\'s definitely doing it,\" said Harry, waving his wand without paying much attention, so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk. \"Moody said Dumbledore only lets Snape stay here because he\\'s giving him a second chance or something. ...\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Ron, his eyes widening, his next cushion spinning high into the air, ricocheting off the chandelier, and dropping heavily onto Flitwick\\'s desk. \"Harry...\\n\\nmaybe Moody thinks Snape put your name in the Goblet of Fire!\"\\n\\n\"Oh Ron,\" said Hermione, shaking her head sceptically, \"we thought Snape was trying to kill Harry before, and it turned out he was saving Harry\\'s life, remember?\"\\n\\nShe Banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at. Harry looked at Hermione, thinking... it was true that Snape had saved his life once, but the odd thing was, Snape definitely loathed him, just as he\\'d loathed Harry s father when they had been at school together. Snape loved taking points from Harry, and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give him punishments, or even to suggest that he should be\\n\\nsuspended from the school.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care what Moody says,\" Hermione went on. \"Dumbledore\\'s not stupid. He was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin, even though loads of people wouldn\\'t have given them jobs, so why shouldn\\'t he be right about Snape, even if Snape is a bit �\"\\n\\n\"� evil,\" said Ron promptly. \"Come on, Hermione, why are all these Dark wizard catchers searching his office, then?\"\\n\\n\"Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill?\" said Hermione, ignoring Ron.\\n\\n\"Its a bit funny, isn\\'t it, that he cant manage to come to the Yule Ball, but he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to?\"\\n\\n\"You just don\\'t like Crouch because of that elf, Winky,\" said Ron, sending a cushion soaring into the window.\\n\\n\"You just want to think Snapes up to something,\" said Hermione, sending her cushion zooming neatly into the box.\\n\\n\"I just want to know what Snape did with his first chance, if he\\'s on his second one,\" said Harry grimly, and his cushion, to his very great surprise, flew straight across the room and landed neatly on top of Hermione\\'s.\\n\\nObedient to Sirius\\'s wish of hearing about anything odd at Hogwarts, Harry sent him a letter by brown owl that night, explaining all about Mr. Crouch breaking into Snape s office, and Moody and Snape\\'s conversation. Then Harry turned his attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing him: how to survive underwater for an hour on the twenty�fourth of February.\\n\\nRon quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again � Harry had explained about Aqua�Lungs, and Ron couldn\\'t see why Harry shouldn\\'t Summon one from the nearest Muggle town. Hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that, in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to operate an Aqua� Lung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy � it was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua�Lung zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts.\\n\\n\"Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into a submarine or something,\" Hermione said. \"If only we\\'d done human Transfiguration already! But I don\\'t think we start that until sixth year, and it can go badly wrong if you don\\'t know what you\\'re doing....\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I don\\'t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head,\"\\n\\nsaid Harry. \"I s\\'pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody; he might do it for me....\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think he\\'d let you choose what you wanted to be turned into, though,\" said Hermione seriously. \"No, I think your best chance is some sort of charm.\"\\n\\nSo Harry, thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last him a lifetime, buried himself once more among the dusty volumes, looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen. However, though he, Ron, and Hermione searched through their lunchtimes, evenings, and whole weekends � though Harry asked Professor McGonagall for a note of permission to use the Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable, vulture�like librarian. Madam Pince, for help � they found nothing whatsoever that would enable Harry to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale.\\n\\nFamiliar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb Harry now, and he was finding it difficult to concentrate in class again. The lake, which Harry had always taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds, drew his eyes whenever he was near a classroom window, a great, iron�gray mass of chilly water, whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon.\\n\\nJust as it had before he faced the Horntail, time was slipping away as though somebody had bewitched the clocks to go extra�fast. There was a week to go before February the twenty�fourth (there was still time) . . . there were five days to go (he was bound to find something soon) .. . three days to go (please let me find something... please). . .\\n\\nWith two days left. Harry started to go off food again. The only good thing about breakfast on Monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent to Sirius. He pulled off the parchment, unrolled it, and saw the shortest letter Sirius had ever written to him.\\n\\nSend date of next Hogsmeade weekend by return owl.\\n\\nHarry turned the parchment over and looked at the back, hoping to see something else, but it was blank.\\n\\n\"Weekend after next,\" whispered Hermione, who had read the note over Harrys shoulder. \"Here � take my quill and send this owl back straight away.\"\\n\\nHarry scribbled the dates down on the back of Sirius\\'s letter, tied it onto the brown owl\\'s leg, and watched it take flight again. What had he expected? Advice on how to survive underwater? He had been so intent on telling Sirius all about Snape and Moody he had completely forgotten to mention the eggs clue.\\n\\n\"What\\'s he want to know about the next Hogsmeade weekend for?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Dunno,\" said Harry dully. The momentary happiness that had flared inside him at the sight of the owl had died. \"Come on ...Care of Magical Creatures.\"\\n\\nWhether Hagrid was trying to make up for the Blast�Ended Skrewts, or because there were now only two skrewts left, or because he was trying to prove he could do anything that Professor Grubbly�Plank could. Harry didnt know, but Hagrid had been continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since he\\'d returned to work. It turned out that Hagrid knew quite as much about unicorns as he did about\\n\\nmonsters, though it was clear that he found their lack of poisonous fangs disappointing.\\n\\nToday he had managed to capture two unicorn foals. Unlike full�grown unicorns, they were pure gold. Parvati and Lavender went into transports of delight at the sight of them, and even Pansy Parkinson had to work hard to conceal how much she liked them.\\n\\n\"Easier ter spot than the adults,\" Hagrid told the class. \"They turn silver when they\\'re abou\\' two years old, an\\' they grow horns at aroun four. Don\\' go pure white till they\\'re full grown, \\'round about seven. They\\'re a bit more trustin when they\\'re babies .. . don mind boys so much.... C\\'mon, move in a bit, yeh can pat \\'em if yeh want. . . give \\'em a few o\\' these sugar lumps. . . .\\n\\n\"You okay. Harry?\" Hagrid muttered, moving aside slightly, while most of the others swarmed around the baby unicorns.\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"Jus\\' nervous, eh?\" said Hagrid.\\n\\n\"Bit,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Harry,\" said Hagrid, clapping a massive hand on his shoulder, so that Harry\\'s knees buckled under its weight, \"I\\'d\\'ve bin worried before I saw yeh take on tha Horntail, but I know now yeh can do anythin\\' yeh set yer mind ter. I\\'m not worried at all. Yeh\\'re goin ter be fine. Got yer clue worked out, haven\\' yeh?\"\\n\\nHarry nodded, but even as he did so, an insane urge to confess that he didn\\'t have any idea how to survive at the bottom of the lake for an hour came over him. He looked up at Hagrid � perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes, to deal with the creatures in it? He looked after everything else on the grounds, after all� \"Yeh\\'re goin\\' ter win,\" Hagrid growled, patting Harrys shoulder again, so that Harry actually felt himself sink a couple of inches into the soft ground. \"I know it.\\n\\nI can feel it. Yeh\\'re goin\\' ter win, Harry n Harry just couldn\\'t bring himself to wipe the happy, confident smile off Hagrid\\'s face. Pretending he was interested in the young unicorns, he forced a smile in return, and moved forward to pat them with the others.\\n\\nBy the evening before the second task. Harry felt as though he were trapped in a nightmare. He was fully aware that even if, by some miracle, he managed to find a suitable spell, he\\'d have a real job mastering it overnight. How could he have let this happen? Why hadn\\'t he got to work on the egg\\'s clue sooner? Why had he ever let his mind wander in class � what if a teacher had once mentioned how to breathe underwater!\\n\\nHe sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the sun set outside, tearing feverishly through page after page of spells, hidden from one another by the massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them. Harry s heart gave a\\n\\nhuge leap every time he saw the word \"water\" on a page, but more often than not it was merely \"Take two pints of water, half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt...\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t reckon it can be done,\" said Rons voice flatly from the other side of the table. \"There\\'s nothing. Nothing. Closest was that thing to dry up puddles and ponds, that Drought Charm, but that was nowhere near powerful enough to drain the lake.\"\\n\\n\"There must be something,\" Hermione muttered, moving a candle closer to her.\\n\\nHer eyes were so tired she was poring over the tiny print of Olde and Forgotten Bewitchments and Charmes with her nose about an inch from the page. \"They\\'d never have set a task that was undoable.\"\\n\\n\"They have,\" said Ron. \"Harry, just go down to the lake tomorrow, right, stick your head in, yell at the merpeople to give back whatever they\\'ve nicked, and see if they chuck it out. Best you can do, mate.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s a way of doing it!\" Hermione said crossly. \"There Just has to be!\"\\n\\nShe seemed to be taking the library\\'s lack of useful information on the subject as a personal insult; it had never failed her before.\\n\\n\"I know what I should have done,\" said Harry, resting, face�down, on Saucy Tricks for Tricky Sorts. \"I should\\'ve learned to be an Animagus like Sirius.\"\\n\\nAn Animagus was a wizard who could transform into an animal.\\n\\n\"Yeah, you could\\'ve turned into a goldfish any time you wanted!\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Or a frog,\" yawned Harry. He was exhausted. \"It takes years to become an Animagus, and then you have to register yourself and everything,\" said Hermione vaguely, now squinting down the index of Weird Wizarding Dilemmas and Their Solutions. \"Professor McGonagall told us, remember... you\\'ve got to register yourself with the Improper Use of Magic Office ...what animal you become, and your markings, so you can\\'t abuse it...\"\\n\\n\"Hermione, I was joking,\" said Harry wearily. \"I know I haven\\'t got a chance of turning into a frog by tomorrow morning....\"\\n\\n\"Oh this is no use,\" Hermione said, snapping shut Weird Wizarding Dilemmas.\\n\\n\"Who on earth wants to make their nose hair grow into ringlets?\"\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t mind,\" said Fred Weasleys voice. \"Be a talking point, wouldn\\'t it?\"\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked up. Fred and George had just emerged from behind some bookshelves.\\n\\n\"What\\'re you two doing here?\" Ron asked.\\n\\n\"Looking for you,\" said George. \"McGonagall wants you, Ron. And you,\\n\\nHermione.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\" said Hermione, looking surprised.\\n\\n\"Dunno ... she was looking a bit grim, though,\" said Fred.\\n\\n\"We\\'re supposed to take you down to her office,\" said George.\\n\\nRon and Hermione stared at Harry, who felt his stomach drop. Was Professor McGonagall about to tell Ron and Hermione off? Perhaps she\\'d noticed how much they were helping him, when he ought to be working out how to do the task alone!\\n\\n\"We\\'ll meet you back in the common room,\" Hermione told Harry as she got up to go with Ron � both of them looked very anxious. \"Bring as many of these books as you can, okay?\"\\n\\n\"Right,\" said Harry uneasily.\\n\\nBy eight o\\'clock. Madam Pince had extinguished all the lamps and came to chivvy Harry out of the library. Staggering under the weight of as many books as he could carry, Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room, pulled a table into a corner, and continued to search. There was nothing in Madcap Magic for Wacky Warlocks. . . nothing in A Guide to Medieval Sorcery . . . not one mention of underwater exploits in An Anthology of Eighteenth�Century Charms, or in Dreadful Denizens of the Deep, or Powers You Never Knew You Had and What to Do with Them Now Youve Wised Up.\\n\\nCrookshanks crawled into Harrys lap and curled up, purring deeply. The common room emptied slowly around Harry. People kept wishing him luck for the next morning in cheery, confident voices like Hagrid s, all of them apparently convinced that he was about to pull off another stunning performance like the one he had managed in the first task. Harry couldn\\'t answer them, he just nodded, feeling as though there were a golfball stuck in his throat. By ten to midnight, he was alone in the room with Crookshanks. He had searched all the remaining books, and Ron and Hermione had not come back.\\n\\nIt\\'s over, he told himself. You can\\'t do it. You\\'ll just have to go down to the lake in the morning and tell the judges....\\n\\nHe imagined himself explaining that he couldn\\'t do the task. He pictured Bagman\\'s look of round�eyed surprise, Karkaroffs satisfied, yellow�toothed smile. He could almost hear Fleur Delacour saying \"I knew it. . . \\'e is too young, \\'e is only a little boy.\" He saw Malfoy flashing his POTTER STINKS badge at the front of the crowd, saw Hagrid s crestfallen, disbelieving face. . . .\\n\\nForgetting that Crookshanks was on his lap. Harry stood up very suddenly; Crookshanks hissed angrily as he landed on the floor, gave Harry a disgusted look, and stalked away with his bottlebrush tail in the air, but Harry was already hurrying up the spiral staircase to his dormitory. ... He would grab the Invisibility\\n\\nCloak and go back to the library, he\\'d stay there all night if he had to. ...\\n\\n\"Lumos,\" Harry whispered fifteen minutes later as he opened the library door.\\n\\nWand tip alight, he crept along the bookshelves, pulling down more books � books of hexes and charms, books on merpeople and water monsters, books on famous witches and wizards, on magical inventions, on anything at all that might include one passing reference to underwater survival. He carried them over to a table, then set to work, searching them by the narrow beam of his wand, occasionally checking his watch. . . .\\n\\nOne in the morning. . . two in the morning . . . the only way he could keep going was to tell himself, over and over again, next book. . . in the next one. . . the next one. . .\\n\\nThe mermaid in the painting in the prefects\\' bathroom was laughing. Harry was bobbing like a cork in bubbly water next to her rock, while she held his Firebolt over his head.\\n\\n\"Come and get it!\" she giggled maliciously. \"Come on, jump!\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t,\" Harry panted, snatching at the Firebolt, and struggling not to sink. \"Give it to me!\"\\n\\nBut she just poked him painfully in the side with the end of the broomstick, laughing at him.\\n\\n\"That hurts � get off� ouch �\"\\n\\n\"Harry Potter must wake up, sir!\"\\n\\n\"Stop poking me �\"\\n\\n\"Dobby must poke Harry Potter, sir, he must wake up!\"\\n\\nHarry opened his eyes. He was still in the library; the Invisibility Cloak had slipped off his head as he\\'d slept, and the side of his face was stuck to the pages of Where There\\'s a Wand, There\\'s a Way. He sat up, straightening his glasses, blinking in the bright daylight.\\n\\n\"Harry Potter needs to hurry!\" squeaked Dobby. \"The second task starts in ten minutes, and Harry Potter �\"\\n\\n\"Ten minutes?\" Harry croaked. \"Ten � ten minutes?\"\\n\\nHe looked down at his watch. Dobby was right. It was twenty past nine. A large, dead weight seemed to fall through Harry\\'s chest into his stomach.\\n\\n\"Hurry, Harry Potter!\" squeaked Dobby, plucking at Harry\\'s sleeve. \"You is supposed to be down by the lake with the other champions, sir!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s too late, Dobby,\" Harry said hopelessly. \"I\\'m not doing the task, I don\\'t know how�\"\\n\\n\"Harry Potter will do the task!\" squeaked the elf. \"Dobby knew Harry had not found the right book, so Dobby did it for him!\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry. \"But you don\\'t know what the second task is �\"\\n\\n\"Dobby knows, sir! Harry Potter has to go into the lake and find his Wheezy �\"\\n\\n\"Find my what?\"\\n\\n\"� and take his Wheezy back from the merpeople!\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s a Wheezy?\"\\n\\n\"Your Wheezy, sir, your Wheezy�Wheezy who is giving Dobby his sweater!\"\\n\\nDobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he was now wearing over his shorts.\\n\\n\"What?\" Harry gasped. \"They\\'ve got. . . they\\'ve got Ron?\"\\n\\n\"The thing Harry Potter will miss most, sir!\" squeaked Dobby. \"\\'But past an hour� \\'�\\n\\n\"� \\'the prospect\\'s black,\\'\" Harry recited, staring, horror�struck, at the elf. \" \\'Too late, it\\'s gone, it won\\'t come back.\\' Dobby � what\\'ve I got to do?\"\\n\\n\"You has to eat this, sir!\" s queaked the elf, and he put his hand in the pocket of his shorts and drew out a ball of what looked like slimy, grayish�green rat tails.\\n\\n\"Right before you go into the lake, sir � gillyweed!\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s it do?\" said Harry, staring at the gillyweed.\\n\\n\"It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater, sir!\"\\n\\n\"Dobby,\" said Harry frantically, \"listen � are you sure about this?\"\\n\\nHe couldn\\'t quite forget that the last time Dobby had tried to \"help\" him, he had ended up with no bones in his right arm.\\n\\n\"Dobby is quite sure, sir!\" said the elf earnestly. \"Dobby hears things, sir, he is a house�elf, he goes all over the castle as he lights the fires and mops the floors.\\n\\nDobby heard Professor McGonagall and Professor Moody in the staffroom, talking about the next task. . . . Dobby cannot let Harry Potter lose his Wheezy!\"\\n\\nHarrys doubts vanished. Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket, then tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels.\\n\\n\"Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!\" Dobby squealed as they burst into\\n\\nthe corridor. \"Dobby will be missed � good luck, Harry Potter, sir, good luck!\"\\n\\n\"See you later, Dobby!\" Harry shouted, and he sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs, three at a time.\\n\\nThe entrance hall contained a few last�minute stragglers, all leaving the Great Hall after breakfast and heading through the double oak doors to watch the second task.\\n\\nThey stared as Harry flashed past, sending Colin and Dennis Creevey flying as he leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright, chilly grounds.\\n\\nAs he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the dragons\\' enclosure in November were now ranged along the opposite bank, rising in stands that were packed to the bursting point and reflected in the lake below. The excited babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water as Harry ran flat�out around the other side of the lake toward the judges, who were sitting at another gold� draped table at the water\\'s edge. Cedric, Fleur, and Krum were beside the judges\\' table, watching Harry sprint toward them.\\n\\n\"I\\'m . .. here ...\" Harry panted, skidding to a halt in the mud and accidentally splattering Fleurs robes.\\n\\n\"Where have you been?\" said a bossy, disapproving voice. \"The task\\'s about to start!\"\\n\\nHarry looked around. Percy Weasley was sitting at the judges\\' table � Mr. Crouch had failed to turn up again.\\n\\n\"Now, now, Percy!\" said Ludo Bagman, who was looking intensely relieved to see Harry. \"Let him catch his breath!\"\\n\\nDumbledore smiled at Harry, but Karkaroff and Madame Maxime didn\\'t look at all pleased to see him. ... It was obvious from the looks on their faces that they had thought he wasn\\'t going to turn up.\\n\\nHarry bent over, hands on his knees, gasping for breath; he had a stitch in his side that felt as though he had a knife between his ribs, but there was no time to get rid of it; Ludo Bagman was now moving among the champions, spacing them along the bank at intervals of ten feet. Harry was on the very end of the line, next to Krum, who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding his wand ready.\\n\\n\"All right. Harry?\" Bagman whispered as he moved Harry a few feet farther away from Krum. \"Know what you\\'re going to do?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" Harry panted, massaging his ribs.\\n\\nBagman gave Harry\\'s shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges\\' table; he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the World Cup, said, \"Sonorus!\" and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands.\\n\\n\"Well, all our champions are ready for the second task, which will start on my\\n\\nwhistle. They have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken from them.\\n\\nOn the count of three, then. One . . . two . . . three!\"\\n\\nThe whistle echoed shrilly in the cold, still air; the stands erupted with cheers and applause; without looking to see what the other champions were doing, Harry pulled off his shoes and socks, pulled the handful of gillyweed out of his pocket, stuffed it into his mouth, and waded out into the lake.\\n\\nIt was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as though this were fire, not icy water. His sodden robes weighed him down as he walked in deeper; now the water was over his knees, and his rapidly numbing feet were slipping over silt and flat, slimy stones. He was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he could; it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery, like octopus tentacles. Waist�deep in the freezing water he stopped, swallowed, and waited for something to happen.\\n\\nHe could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he must look stupid, walking into the lake without showing any sign of magical power. The part of him that was still dry was covered in goose pimples; half immersed in the icy water, a cruel breeze lifting his hair, Harry started to shiver violently. He avoided looking at the stands; the laughter was becoming louder, and there were catcalls and jeering from the Slytherins. ...\\n\\nThen, quite suddenly, Harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed over his mouth and nose. He tried to draw breath, but it made his head spin; his lungs were empty, and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck � Harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below his ears, flapping in the cold air. . . . He had gills. Without pausing to think, he did the only thing that made sense � he flung himself forward into the water.\\n\\nThe first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life. His head had stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain. He stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at them. They looked green and ghostly under the water, and they had become webbed. He twisted around and looked at his bare feet � they had become elongated and the toes were webbed too: It looked as though he had sprouted flippers.\\n\\nThe water didn\\'t feel icy anymore either ... on the contrary, he felt pleasantly cool and very light. . . . Harry struck out once more, marveling at how far and fast his flipper�like feet propelled him through the vater, and noticing how clearly he could see, and how he no longer seemed to need to blink. He had soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom. He flipped over and dived into its depths.\\n\\nSilence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange, dark, foggy landscape.\\n\\nHe could only see ten feet around him, so that as he sped throuugh the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the incoming darkness: forests of rippling,\\n\\ntangled black weed, wide plains of mud littered with dull, glimmering stones. He swam deeper and deeper, out toward the middle of the lake, his eyes wide, staring through the eerily gray�lit water around him to the shadow beyond, where the water became opaque.\\n\\nSmall fish flickered past him like silver darts. Once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving ahead of him, but when he got nearer, he discovered it to be nothing but a large, blackened log, or a dense clump of weed. There was no sign of any of the other champions, merpeople, Ron � nor, thankfully, the giant squid.\\n\\nLight green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see, two feet deep, like a meadow of very overgrown grass. Harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him, trying to discern shapes through the gloom . . . and then, without warning, something grabbed hold of his ankle.\\n\\nHarry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a small, horned water demon, poking out of the weed, its long fingers clutched tightly around Harry\\'s leg, its pointed fangs bared � Harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand. By the time he had grasped it, two more grindylows had risen out of the weed, had seized handfuls of Harry\\'s robes, and were attempting to drag him down.\\n\\n\"Relashio!\" Harry shouted, except that no sound came out. ... A large bubble issued from his mouth, and his wand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for where it struck them, angry red patches appeared on their green skin. Harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam, as fast as he could, occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random; every now and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again, and he kicked out, hard; finally, he felt his foot connect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw the dazed grindylow floating away, cross�eyed, while its fellows shook their fists at Harry and sank back into the weed.\\n\\nHarry slowed down a little, slipped his wand back inside his robes, and looked around, listening again. He turned full circle in the water, the silence pressing harder than ever against his eardrums. He knew he must be even deeper in the lake now, but nothing was moving but the rippling weed.\\n\\n\"How are you getting on?\"\\n\\nHarry thought he was having a heart attack. He whipped around and saw Moaning Myrtle floating hazily in front of him, gazing at him through her thick, pearly glasses.\\n\\n\"Myrtle!\" Harry tried to shout � but once again, nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble. Moaning Myrtle actually giggled.\\n\\n\"You want to try over there!\" she said, pointing. \"I won\\'t come with you. ... I don\\'t\\n\\nlike them much, they always chase me when I get too close. ...\"\\n\\nHarry gave her the thumbs�up to show his thanks and set off once more, careful to swim a bit higher over the weed to avoid any more grindylows that might be lurking there.\\n\\nHe swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes. He was passing over vast expanses of black mud now, which swirled murkily as he disturbed the water.\\n\\nThen, at long last, he heard a snatch of haunting mersong.\\n\\n\"An hour long you\\'ll have to look, And to recover what we took...\"\\n\\nHarry swam faster and soon saw a large rock emerge out of the muddy water ahead. It had paintings of merpeople on it; they were carrying spears and chasing what looked like the giant squid. Harry swam on past the rock, following the mersong.\\n\\n\". . . your time\\'s half gone, so tarry not Lest what you seek stays here to rot. ...\"\\n\\nA cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae loomed suddenly out of the gloom on all sides. Here and there at the dark windows, Harry saw faces . . . faces that bore no resemblance at all to the painting of the mermaid in the prefects\\' bathroom. . . .\\n\\nThe merpeople had grayish skin and long, wild, dark green hair. Their eyes were yellow, as were their broken teeth, and they wore thick ropes of pebbles around their necks. They leered at Harry as he swam past; one or two of them emerged from their caves to watch him better, their powerful, silver fish tails beating the water, spears clutched in their hands.\\n\\nHarry sped on, staring around, and soon the dwellings became more numerous; there were gardens of weed around some of them, and he even saw a pet grindylow tied to a stake outside one door. Merpeople were emerging on all sides now, watching him eagerly, pointing at his webbed hands and gills, talking behind their hands to one another. Harry sped around a corner and a very strange sight met his eyes.\\n\\nA whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the houses that lined what looked like a mer�version of a village square. A choir of merpeople was singing in the middle, calling the champions toward them, and behind them rose a crude sort of statue; a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder. Four people were bound tightly to the tail of the stone merperson.\\n\\nRon was tied between Hermione and Cho Chang. There was also a girl who looked no older than eight, whose clouds of silvery hair made Harry feel sure that she was Fleur Delacour\\'s sister. All four of them appeared to be in a very deep\\n\\nsleep. Their heads were lolling onto their shoulders, and fine streams of bubbles kept issuing from their mouths.\\n\\nHarry sped toward the hostages, half expecting the merpeople to lower their spears and charge at him, but they did nothing. The ropes of weed tying the hostages to the statue were thick, slimy, and very strong. For a fleeting second he thought of the knife Sirius had bought him for Christmas � locked in his trunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away, no use to him whatsoever.\\n\\nHe looked around. Many of the merpeople surrounding them were carrying spears.\\n\\nHe swam swiftly toward a seven�foot�tall merman with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to mime a request to borrow the spear. The merman laughed and shook his head.\\n\\n\"We do not help,\" he said in a harsh, croaky voice.\\n\\n\"Come ON!\" Harry said fiercely (but only bubbles issued from his mouth), and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman, but the merman yanked it back, still shaking his head and laughing.\\n\\nHarry swirled around, staring about. Something sharp . . . anything . . .\\n\\nThere were rocks littering the lake bottom. He dived and snatched up a particularly jagged one and returned to the statue. He began to hack at the ropes binding Ron, and after several minutes\\' hard work, they broke apart. Ron floated, unconscious, a few inches above the lake bottom, drifting a little in the ebb of the water.\\n\\nHarry looked around. There was no sign of any of the other champions. What were they playing at? Why didn\\'t they hurry up? He turned back to Hermione, raised the jagged rock, and began to hack at her bindings too � At once, several pairs of strong gray hands seized him. Half a dozen mermen were pulling him away from Hermione, shaking their green�haired heads, and laughing.\\n\\n\"You take your own hostage,\" one of them said to him. \"Leave the others ...\"\\n\\n\"No way!\" said Harry furiously � but only two large bubbles came out.\\n\\nYour task is to retrieve your own friend . . . leave the others ...\" She\\'s my friend too!\" Harry yelled, gesturing toward Hermione, an enormous silver bubble emerging soundlessly from his lips. \"And I don\\'t want them to die either!\"\\n\\nCho\\'s head was on Hermiones shoulder; the small silver�haired girl was ghostly green and pale. Harry struggled to fight off the mermen, but they laughed harder than ever, holding him back. Harry looked wildly around. Where were the other champions? Would he have time to take Ron to the surface and come back down for Hermione and the others? Would he be able to find them again? He looked down at his watch to see how much time was left � it had stopped working.\\n\\nBut then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over his head. Harry looked\\n\\nup and saw Cedric swimming toward them. There was an enormous bubble around his head, which made his features look oddly wide and stretched.\\n\\n\"Got lost!\" he mouthed, looking panic�stricken. \"Fleur and Krum\\'re coming now!\"\\n\\nFeeling enormously relieved, Harry watched Cedric pull a knife out of his pocket and cut Cho free. He pulled her upward and out of sight.\\n\\nHarry looked around, waiting. Where were Fleur and Krum? Time was getting short, and according to the song, the hostages would be lost after an hour. . . .\\n\\nThe merpeople started screeching animatedly. Those holding Harry loosened their grip, staring behind them. Harry turned and saw something monstrous cutting through the water toward them: a human body in swimming trunks with the head of a shark. ... It was Krum. He appeared to have transfigured himself� but badly.\\n\\nThe shark�man swam straight to Hermione and began snapping and biting at her ropes; the trouble was that Krum\\'s new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dolphin, and Harry was quite sure that if Krum wasn\\'t careful, he was going to rip Hermione in half. Darting forward. Harry hit Krum hard on the shoulder and held up the jagged stone. Krum seized it and began to cut Hermione free. Within seconds, he had done it; he grabbed Hermione around the waist, and without a backward glance, began to rise rapidly with her toward the surface.\\n\\nNow what? Harry thought desperately. If he could be sure that Fleur was coming. .\\n\\n. . But still no sign. There was nothing to be done except. . .\\n\\nHe snatched up the stone, which Krum had dropped, but the mermen now closed in around Ron and the little girl, shaking their heads at him. Harry pulled out his wand.\\n\\n\"Get out of the way!\"\\n\\nOnly bubbles flew out of his mouth, but he had the distinct impression that the mermen had understood him, because they suddenly stopped laughing. Their yellowish eyes were fixed upon Harry\\'s wand, and they looked scared. There might be a lot more of them than there were of him, but Harry could tell, by the looks on their faces, that they knew no more magic than the giant squid did.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got until three!\" Harry shouted; a great stream of bubbles burst from him, but he held up three fingers to make sure they got the message. \"One . . .\" (he put down a finger) \"two . . .\" (he put down a second one) � They scattered. Harry darted forward and began to hack at the ropes binding the small girl to the statue, and at last she was free. He seized the little girl around the waist, grabbed the neck of Rons robes, and kicked off from the bottom.\\n\\nIt was very slow work. He could no longer use his webbed hands to propel himself forward; he worked his flippers furiously, but Ron and Fleur\\'s sister were like\\n\\npotato�filled sacks dragging him back down. ... He fixed his eyes skyward, though he knew he must still be very deep, the water above him was so dark, . . .\\n\\nMerpeople were rising with him. He could see them swirling around him with ease, watching him struggle through the water. .. . Would they pull him back down to the depths when the time was up? Did they perhaps eat humans? Harry\\'s legs were seizing up with the effort to keep swimming; his shoulders were aching horribly with the effort of dragging Ron and the girl...\\n\\nHe was drawing breath with extreme difficulty. He could feel pain on the sides of his neck again ... he was becoming very aware of how wet the water was in his mouth .. . yet the darkness was definitely thinning now... he could see daylight above him.. ..\\n\\nHe kicked hard with his flippers and discovered that they were nothing more than feet...water was flooding through his mouth into his lungs ... he was starting to feel dizzy, but he knew light and air were only ten feet above him ... he had to get there ... he had to ...\\n\\nHarry kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as though his muscles were screaming in protest; his very brain felt waterlogged, he couldn\\'t breathe, he needed oxygen, he had to keep going, he could not stop � And then he felt his head break the surface of the lake; wonderful, cold, clear air was making his wet face sting; he gulped it down, feeling as though he had never breathed properly before, and, panting, pulled Ron and the little girl up with him.\\n\\nAll around him, wild, green�haired heads were emerging out of the water with him, but they were smiling at him.\\n\\nThe crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise; shouting and screaming, they all seemed to be on their feet; Harry had the impression they thought that Ron and the little girl might be dead, but they were wrong . . . both of them had opened their eyes; the girl looked scared and confused, but Ron merely expelled a great spout of water, blinked in the bright light, turned to Harry, and said, \"Wet, this, isn\\'t it?\" Then he spotted Fleur\\'s sister. \"What did you bring her for?\"\\n\\n\"Fleur didn\\'t turn up, I couldn\\'t leave her,\" Harry panted.\\n\\n\"Harry, you prat,\" said Ron, \"you didn\\'t take that song thing seriously, did you!\\n\\nDumbledore wouldn\\'t have let any of us drown!\"\\n\\n\"The song said �\"\\n\\n\"It was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit!\" said Ron. \"I hope you didn\\'t waste time down there acting the hero!\"\\n\\nHarry felt both stupid and annoyed. It was all very well for Ron; he\\'d been asleep, he hadn\\'t felt how eerie it was down in the lake, surrounded by spear�carrying merpeople who\\'d looked more than capable of murder.\\n\\n\"C\\'mon,\" Harry said shortly, \"help me with her, I don\\'t think she can swim very well.\"\\n\\nThey pulled Fleur\\'s sister through the water, back toward the bank where the judges stood watching, twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of honor, singing their horrible screechy songs.\\n\\nHarry could see Madam Pomfrey fussing over Hermione, Krum, Cedric, and Cho, all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets.\\n\\nDumbledore and Ludo Bagman stood beaming at Harry and Ron from the bank as they swam nearer, but Percy, who looked very white and somehow much younger than usual, came splashing out to meet them. Meanwhile Madame Maxime was trying to restrain Fleur Delacour, who was quite hysterical, fighting tooth and nail to return to the water.\\n\\n\"Gabrielle! Gabrielle! Is she alive? Is she \\'urt?\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s fine!\" Harry tried to tell her, but he was so exhausted he could hardly talk, let alone shout.\\n\\nPercy seized Ron and was dragging him back to the bank (\"Gerroff, Percy, I\\'m all right!\"); Dumbledore and Bagman were pulling Harry upright; Fleur had broken free of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister.\\n\\n\"It was ze grindylows . . . zey attacked me ... oh Gabrielle, I thought... I thought..\\n\\n.\"\\n\\n\"Come here, you,\" said Madam Pomfrey. She seized Harry and pulled him over to Hermione and the others, wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket, and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat.\\n\\nSteam gushed out of his ears.\\n\\n\"Harry, well done!\" Hermione cried. \"You did it, you found out how all by yourself!\"\\n\\n\"Well �\" said Harry. He would have told her about Dobby, but he had just noticed Karkaroff watching him. He was the only judge who had not left the table; the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that Harry, Ron, and Fleur\\'s sister had got back safely. \"Yeah, that\\'s right,\" said Harry, raising his voice slightly so that Karkaroff could hear him.\\n\\n\"You haff a water beetle in your hair, Herm�own�ninny,\" said Krum. Harry had the impression that Krum was drawing her attention back onto himself; perhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her from the lake, but Hermione brushed away the beetle impatiently and said, \"You\\'re well outside the time limit, though, Harry.\\n\\n. . . Did it take you ages to find us?\"\\n\\n\"No ... I found you okay....\"\\n\\nHarry\\'s feeling of stupidity was growing. Now he was out of the water, it seemed perfectly clear that Dumbledores safety precautions wouldn\\'t have permitted the death of a hostage just because their champion hadn\\'t turned up. Why hadn\\'t he just grabbed Ron and gone? He would have been first back.... Cedric and Krum hadn\\'t wasted time worrying about anyone else; they hadn\\'t taken the mersong seriously. ...\\n\\nDumbledore was crouching at the water\\'s edge, deep in conversation with what seemed to be the chief merperson, a particularly wild and ferocious�looking female. He was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople made when they were above water; clearly, Dumbledore could speak Mermish. Finally he straightened up, turned to his fellow judges, and said, \"A conference before we give the marks, I think.\"\\n\\nThe judges went into a huddle. Madam Pomfrey had gone to rescue Ron from Percy\\'s clutches; she led him over to Harry and the others, gave him a blanket and some Pepperup Potion, then went to fetch Fleur and her sister. Fleur had many cuts on her face and arms and her robes were torn, but she didn\\'t seem to care, nor would she allow Madam Pomfrey to clean them.\\n\\n\"Look after Gabrielle,\" she told her, and then she turned to Harry. \"You saved \\'er,\"\\n\\nshe said breathlessly. \"Even though she was not your \\'ostage.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, who was now heartily wishing he\\'d left all three girls tied to the statue.\\n\\nFleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek (he felt his face burn and wouldn\\'t have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again), then said to Ron, \"And you too�you \\'elped �\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron, looking extremely hopeful, \"yeah, a bit �\"\\n\\nFleur swooped down on him too and kissed him. Hermione looked simply furious, but just then, Ludo Bagman\\'s magically magnified voice boomed out beside them, making them all jump, and causing the crowd in the stands to go very quiet.\\n\\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our decision. Merchieftainess Murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake, and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions, as follows. . . .\\n\\n\"Fleur Delacour, though she demonstrated excellent use of the Bubble�Head Charm, was attacked by grindylows as she approached her goal, and failed to retrieve her hostage. We award her twenty�five points.\"\\n\\nApplause from the stands.\\n\\n\"I deserved zero,\" said Fleur throatily, shaking her magnificent head.\\n\\n\"Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble�Head Charm, was first to return with his hostage, though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour.\"\\n\\nEnormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the crowd; Harry saw Cho give Cedric a glowing look. \"We therefore award him forty�seven points.\"\\n\\nHarrys heart sank. If Cedric had been outside the time limit, he most certainly had been.\\n\\n\"Viktor Krum used an incomplete form of Transfiguration, which was nevertheless effective, and was second to return with his hostage. We award him forty points.\"\\n\\nKarkaroff clapped particularly hard, looking very superior.\\n\\n\"Harry Potter used gillyweed to great effect,\" Bagman continued. \"He returned last, and well outside the time limit of an hour. However, the Merchieftainess informs us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the hostages, and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety, not merely his own.\"\\n\\nRon and Hermione both gave Harry half�exasperated, half�commiserating looks.\\n\\n\"Most of the judges,\" and here, Bagman gave Karkaroff a very nasty look, \"feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks. However . . . Mr. Potter\\'s score is forty�five points.\"\\n\\nHarry\\'s stomach leapt � he was now tying for first place with Cedric. Ron and Hermione, caught by surprise, stared at Harry, then laughed and started applauding hard with the rest of the crowd.\\n\\n\"There you go. Harry!\" Ron shouted over the noise. \"You weren\\'t being thick after all � you were showing moral fiber!\"\\n\\nFleur was clapping very hard too, but Krum didn\\'t look happy at all. He attempted to engage Hermione in conversation again, but she was too busy cheering Harry to listen.\\n\\n\"The third and final task will take place at dusk on the twenty�fourth of June,\"\\n\\ncontinued Bagman. \"The champions will be notified of what is coming precisely one month beforehand. Thank you all for your support of the champions.\"\\n\\nIt was over. Harry thought dazedly, as Madam Pomfrey began herding the champions and hostages back to the castle to get into dry clothes ... it was over, he had got through ... he didn\\'t have to worry about anything now until June the twenty�fourth. . ..\\n\\nNext time he was in Hogsmeade, Harry decided as he walked back up the stone steps into the castle, he was going to buy Dobby a pair of socks for every day of the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY�SEVEN � PADFOOT RETURNS\\n\\nOne of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake, which meant that Ron was getting to share Harry\\'s limelight for once. Harry noticed that Ron\\'s version of events changed subtly with every retelling. At first, he gave what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with Hermione\\'s story, anyway � Dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor McGonagall\\'s office, first assuring them that they would be quite safe, and would awake when they were back above the water. One week later, however, Ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled single�handedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into submission before tying him up.\\n\\n\"But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve,\" he assured Padma Patil, who seemed to be a lot keener on Ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making a point of talking to him every time they passed in the corridors. \"I could\\'ve taken those mer�idiots any time I wanted.\"\\n\\n\"What were you going to do, snore at them?\" said Hermione waspishly. People had been teasing her so much about being the thing that Viktor Krum would most miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood.\\n\\nRon\\'s ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of events.\\n\\nAs they entered March the weather became drier, but cruel winds skinned their hands and faces every time they went out onto the grounds. There were delays in the post because the owls kept being blown off course. The brown owl that Harry had sent to Sirius with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way; Harry had no sooner torn off Sirius\\'s reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside again.\\n\\nSirius\\'s letter was almost as short as the previous one.\\n\\nBe at stile at end of road out of Hogsmeade (past Dervish and Banges) at two o\\'clock on Saturday afternoon. Bring as much food as you can.\\n\\n\"He hasn\\'t come back to Hogsmeade?\" said Ron incredulously.\\n\\n\"It looks like it, doesn\\'t it?\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t believe him,\" said Harry tensely, \"if he\\'s caught. . .\"\\n\\n\"Made it so far, though, hasn\\'t he?\" said Ron. \"And it\\'s not like the place is swarming with dementors anymore.\"\\n\\nHarry folded up the letter, thinking. If he was honest with himself, he really wanted to see Sirius again. He therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon � double Potions � feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons.\\n\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson\\'s gang of Slytherin girls. All of them were looking at something Harry couldn\\'t see and sniggering heartily. Pansys pug�like face peered excitedly around Goyle\\'s broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached.\\n\\n\"There they are, there they are!\" she giggled, and the knot of Slytherins broke apart. Harry saw that Pansy had a magazine in her hands � Witch Weekly. The moving picture on the front showed a curly�haired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand.\\n\\n\"You might find something to interest you in there, Granger!\" Pansy said loudly, and she threw the magazine at Hermione, who caught it, looking startled. At that moment, the dungeon door opened, and Snape beckoned them all inside.\\n\\nHermione, Harry, and Ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual.\\n\\nOnce Snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of todays potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk. At last, in the center pages, Hermione found what they were looking for.\\n\\nHarry and Ron leaned in closer. A color photograph of Harry headed a short piece entitled: Harry Potter\\'s Secret Heartache A boy like no other, perhaps � yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of adolescence, writes Rita Skeeter. Deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents, fourteen�year�old Harry Potter thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at Hogwarts, Muggle�born Hermione Granger. Little did he know that he would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow in a life already littered with personal loss.\\n\\nMiss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to have a taste for famous wizards that Harry alone cannot satisfy. Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor Krum, Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World Quidditch Cup, Miss Granger has been toying with both boys\\' affections. Krum, who is openly smitten with the devious Miss Granger, has already invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer holidays, and insists that he has \"never felt this way about any other girl.\"\\n\\nHowever, it might not be Miss Granger\\'s doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys\\' interest.\\n\\n\"She\\'s really ugly,\" says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty and vivacious fourth�year student, \"but she\\'d be well up to making a Love Potion, she\\'s quite brainy. I think that\\'s how she\\'s doing it.\"\\n\\nLove Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and no doubt Albus Dumbledore will want to investigate these claims. In the meantime, Harry Potters well�wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate.\\n\\n\"I told you!\" Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared down at the article. \"I told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter! She\\'s made you out to be some sort of� of scarlet woman!\"\\n\\nHermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter. \"Scarlet woman?\" she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at Ron.\\n\\n\"It\\'s what my mum calls them,\" Ron muttered, his ears going red.\\n\\n\"If that\\'s the best Rita can do, she\\'s losing her touch,\" said Hermione, still giggling, as she threw Witch Weekly onto the empty chair beside her. \"What a pile of old rubbish.\"\\n\\nShe looked over at the Slytherins, who were all watching her and Harry closely across the room to see if they had been upset by the article. Hermione gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, Harry, and Ron started unpacking the ingredients they would need for their Wit�Sharpening Potion.\\n\\n\"There\\'s something funny, though,\" said Hermione ten minutes later, holding her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles. \"How could Rita Skeeter have known . . . ?\"\\n\\n\"Known what?\" said Ron quickly. \"You haven\\'t been mixing up Love Potions, have you?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be stupid,\" Hermione snapped, starting to pound up her beetles again. \"No, it\\'s just. . . how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer?\"\\n\\nHermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided Ron\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\"What?\" said Ron, dropping his pestle with a loud clunk.\\n\\n\"He asked me right after he\\'d pulled me out of the lake,\"\\n\\nHermione muttered. \"After he\\'d got rid of his shark\\'s head. Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn\\'t hear, and he said, if I wasn\\'t doing anything over the summer, would I like to �\"\\n\\n\"And what did you say?\" said Ron, who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was looking at\\n\\nHermione.\\n\\n\"And he did say he\\'d never felt the same way about anyone else,\" Hermione went on, going so red now that Harry could almost feel the heat coming from her, \"but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him? She wasn\\'t there ... or was she? Maybe she has got an Invisibility Cloak; maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task. ...\"\\n\\n\"And what did you say?\" Ron repeated, pounding his pestle down so hard that it dented the desk.\\n\\n\"Well, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were okay to�\"\\n\\n\"Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is. Miss Granger,\" said an icy voice right behind them, and all three of them jumped, \"I must ask you not to discuss it in my class. Ten points from Gryffindor.\"\\n\\nSnape had glided over to their desk while they were talking. The whole class was now looking around at them; Malfoy took the opportunity to flash POTTER STINKS across the dungeon at Harry.\\n\\n\"Ah . . . reading magazines under the table as well?\" Snape added, snatching up the copy of Witch Weekly. \"A further ten points from Gryffindor ... oh but of course ...\" Snapes black eyes glittered as they fell on Rita Skeeter\\'s article. \"Potter has to keep up with his press cuttings. . . .\"\\n\\nThe dungeon rang with the Slytherins\\' laughter, and an unpleasant smile curled Snape\\'s thin mouth. To Harry\\'s fury, he began to read the article aloud.\\n\\n\"\\'Harry Potter\\'s Secret Heartache. . . dear, dear. Potter, what\\'s ailing you now? \\'A boy like no other, perhaps. . .\\'�\\n\\nHarry could feel his face burning. Snape was pausing at the end of every sentence to allow the Slytherins a hearty laugh. The article sounded ten times worse when read by Snape. Even Hermione was blushing scarlet now.\\n\\n\"\\'. . . Harry Potter\\'s well�wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate.\\' How very touching,\" sneered Snape, rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins. \"Well, I think I had better separate the three of you, so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives. Weasley, you stay here. Miss Granger, over there, beside Miss Parkinson. Potter � that table in front of my desk. Move. Now.\"\\n\\nFurious, Harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron and dragged it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table. Snape followed, sat down at his desk and watched Harry unload his cauldron. Determined not to look at Snape, Harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles, imagining each one to have Snape\\'s face.\\n\\n\"All this press attention seems to have inflated your already over�large head.\\n\\nPotter,\" said Snape quietly, once the rest of the class had settled down again.\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t answer. He knew Snape was trying to provoke him; he had done this before. No doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points from Gryffindor before the end of the class.\\n\\n\"You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you,\" Snape went on, so quietly that no one else could hear him (Harry continued to pound his scarab beetles, even though he had already reduced them to a very fine powder), \"but I don\\'t care how many times your picture appears in the papers. To me. Potter, you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him.\"\\n\\nHarry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up his ginger roots. His hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his eyes down, as though he couldn\\'t hear what Snape was saying to him.\\n\\n\"So I give you fair warning, Potter,\" Snape continued in a sorter and more dangerous voice, \"pint�sized celebrity or not � if I catch you breaking into my office one more time �\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t been anywhere near your office!\" said Harry angrily, forgetting his feigned deafness.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t lie to me,\" Snape hissed, his fathomless black eyes boring into Harrys.\\n\\n\"Boomslang skin. Gillyweed. Both come from my private stores, and I know who stole them.\"\\n\\nHarry stared back at Snape, determined not to blink or to look guilty. In truth, he hadn\\'t stolen either of these things from Snape. Hermione had taken the boomslang skin back in their second year � they had needed it for the Polyjuice Potion � and while Snape had suspected Harry at the time, he had never been able to prove it. Dobby, of course, had stolen the gillyweed.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about,\" Harry lied coldly.\\n\\n\"You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into!\" Snape hissed. \"I know it. Potter! Now, Mad�Eye Moody might have joined your fan club, but I will not tolerate your behavior! One more nighttime stroll into my office, Potter, and you will pay!\"\\n\\n\"Right,\" said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger roots. \"I\\'ll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there.\"\\n\\nSnape\\'s eyes flashed. He plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes. For one wild moment. Harry thought Snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him � then he saw that Snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion. Harry stared at it.\\n\\n\"Do you know what this is. Potter?\" Snape said, his eyes glittering dangerously\\n\\nagain.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry, with complete honesty this time.\\n\\n\"It is Veritaserum � a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear,\" said Snape viciously.\\n\\n\"Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch your step, you might just find that my hand slips\" � he shook the crystal bottle slightly � \"right over your evening pumpkin juice. And then. Potter . .\\n\\n. then we\\'ll find out whether you\\'ve been in my office or not.\"\\n\\nHarry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger roots once more, picked up his knife, and started slicing them again. He didn\\'t like the sound of that Truth Potion at all, nor would he put it past Snape to slip him some. He repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if Snape did it... quite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble � Hermione and Dobby for a start � there were all the other things he was concealing . . . like the fact that he was in contact with Sirius . . . and � his insides squirmed at the thought � how he felt about Cho. ... He tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too, and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of Moody s book and start drinking only from a private hip flask.\\n\\nThere was a knock on the dungeon door.\\n\\n\"Enter,\" said Snape in his usual voice.\\n\\nThe class looked around as the door opened. Professor Karkaroff came in.\\n\\nEveryone watched him as he walked up toward Snape\\'s desk. He was twisting his finger around his goatee and looking agitated.\\n\\n\"We need to talk,\" said Karkaroff abruptly when he had reached Snape. He seemed so determined that nobody should hear what he was saying that he was barely opening his lips; it was as though he were a rather poor ventriloquist. Harry kept his eyes on his ginger roots, listening hard.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff,\" Snape muttered, but Karkaroff interrupted him.\\n\\n\"I want to talk now, while you can\\'t slip off, Severus. You\\'ve been avoiding me.\"\\n\\n\"After the lesson,\" Snape snapped.\\n\\nUnder the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if he\\'d poured out enough armadillo bile, Harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them. Karkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape looked angry.\\n\\nKarkaroff hovered behind Snape\\'s desk for the rest of the double period. He seemed intent on preventing Snape from slipping away at the end of class. Keen to hear what Karkaroff wanted to say, Harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell, which gave him an excuse to\\n\\nduck down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class moved noisily toward the door.\\n\\n\"What\\'s so urgent?\" he heard Snape hiss at Karkaroff.\\n\\n\"This,\" said Karkaroff, and Harry, peering around the edge of his cauldron, saw Karkaroff pull up the left�hand sleeve of his robe and show Snape something on his inner forearm.\\n\\n\"Well?\" said Karkaroff, still making every effort not to move his lips. \"Do you see? It\\'s never been this clear, never since � \"\\n\\n\"Put it away!\" snarled Snape, his black eyes sweeping the classroom.\\n\\n\"But you must have noticed �\" Karkaroff began in an agitated voice.\\n\\n\"We can talk later, Karkaroff!\" spat Snape. \"Potter! What are you doing?\"\\n\\n\"Clearing up my armadillo bile, Professor,\" said Harry innocently, straightening up and showing Snape the sodden rag he was holding.\\n\\nKarkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon. He looked both worried and angry. Not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry Snape, Harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just witnessed.\\n\\nThey left the castle at noon the next day to find a weak silver sun shining down upon the grounds. The weather was milder than it had been all year, and by the time they arrived in Hogsmeade, all three of them had taken off their cloaks and thrown them over their shoulders. The food Sirius had told them to bring was in Harry\\'s bag; they had sneaked a dozen chicken legs, a loaf of bread, and a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch table.\\n\\nThey went into Gladrags Wizardwear to buy a present for Dobby, where they had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find, including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars, and another that screamed loudly when they became too smelly. Then, at half past one, they made their way up the High Street, past Dervish and Banges, and out toward the edge of the village.\\n\\nHarry had never been in this direction before. The winding lane was leading them out into the wild countryside around Hogsmeade. The cottages were fewer here, and their gardens larger; they were walking toward the foot of the mountain in whose shadow Hogsmeade lay. Then they turned a corner and saw a stile at the end of the lane. Waiting for them, its front paws on the topmost bar, was a very large, shaggy black dog, which was carrying some newspapers in its mouth and looking very familiar. . . .\\n\\n\"Hello, Sirius,\" said Harry when they had reached him.\\n\\nThe black dog sniffed Harry\\'s bag eagerly, wagged its tail once, then turned and\\n\\nbegan to trot away from them across the scrubby patch of ground that rose to meet the rocky foot of the mountain. Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed over the stile and followed.\\n\\nSirius led them to the very foot of the mountain, where the ground was covered with boulders and rocks. It was easy for him, with his four paws, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione were soon out of breath. They followed Sirius higher, up onto the mountain itself. For nearly half an hour they climbed a steep, winding, and stony path, following Sirius\\'s wagging tail, sweating in the sun, the shoulder straps of Harry\\'s bag cutting into his shoulders.\\n\\nThen, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached the place where he had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the rock. They squeezed into it and found themselves in a cool, dimly lit cave. Tethered at the end of it, one end of his rope around a large rock, was Buckbeak the hippogriff. Half gray horse, half giant eagle, Buckbeak\\'s fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them. All three of them bowed low to him, and after regarding them imperiously for a moment, Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed Hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck. Harry, however, was looking at the black dog, which had just turned into his godfather.\\n\\nSirius was wearing ragged gray robes; the same ones he had been wearing when he had left Azkaban. His black hair was longer than it had been when he had appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and matted once more. He looked very thin.\\n\\n\"Chicken!\" he said hoarsely after removing the old Daily Prophets from his mouth and throwing them down onto the cave floor.\\n\\nHarry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and bread.\\n\\n\"Thanks,\" said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a drumstick, sitting down on the cave floor, and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth. \"I\\'ve been living off rats mostly.\\n\\nCan\\'t steal too much food from Hogsmeade; I\\'d draw attention to myself.\"\\n\\nHe grinned up at Harry, but Harry returned the grin only reluctantly.\\n\\n\"What\\'re you doing here, Sirius?\" he said.\\n\\n\"Fulfilling my duty as godfather,\" said Sirius, gnawing on the chicken bone in a very doglike way. \"Don\\'t worry about it, I\\'m pretending to be a lovable stray.\"\\n\\nHe was still grinning, but seeing the anxiety in Harrys face, said more seriously, \"I want to be on the spot. Your last letter . . . well, let\\'s just say things are getting fishier. I\\'ve been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out, and by the looks of things, I\\'m not the only one who\\'s getting worried.\"\\n\\nHe nodded at the yellowing Daily Prophets on the cave floor, and Ron picked them up and unfolded them. Harry, however, continued to stare at Sirius.\\n\\n\"What if they catch you? What if you\\'re seen?\"\\n\\n\"You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I\\'m an Animagus,\" said Sirius, shrugging, and continuing to devour the chicken leg.\\n\\nRon nudged Harry and passed him the Daily Prophets. There were two: The first bore the headline Mystery Illness ofBartemius Crouch, the second, Ministry Witch Still Missing�Minister of Magic Now Personally Involved.\\n\\nHarry scanned the story about Crouch. Phrases jumped out at him: hasn\\'t been seen in public since November. . . house appears deserted. . . St. Mungo\\'s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries decline comment. . . Ministry refuses to confirm rumors of critical illness. . . .\\n\\n\"They\\'re making it sound like he\\'s dying,\" said Harry slowly. \"But he can\\'t be that ill if he managed to get up here. . . .\"\\n\\n\"My brothers Crouch\\'s personal assistant,\" Ron informed Sirius. \"He says Crouch is suffering from overwork.\"\\n\\n\"Mind you, he did look ill, last time I saw him up close,\" said Harry slowly, still reading the story. \"The night my name came out of the goblet. ...\"\\n\\n\"Getting his comeuppance for sacking Winky, isn\\'t he?\" said Hermione, an edge to her voice. She was stroking Buckbeak, who was crunching up Sirius\\'s chicken bones. \"I bet he wishes he hadn\\'t done it now � bet he feels the difference now she\\'s not there to look after him.\"\\n\\n\"Hermione\\'s obsessed with house�elfs,\" Ron muttered to Sirius, casting Hermione a dark look. Sirius, however, looked interested.\\n\\n\"Crouch sacked his house�elf?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup,\" said Harry, and he launched into the story of the Dark Mark\\'s appearance, and Winky being found with Harrys wand clutched in her hand, and Mr. Crouch\\'s fury. When Harry had finished, Sirius was on his feet again and had started pacing up and down the cave.\\n\\n\"Let me get this straight,\" he said after a while, brandishing a fresh chicken leg.\\n\\n\"You first saw the elfin the Top Box. She was saving Crouch a seat, right?\"\\n\\n\"Right,\" said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.\\n\\n\"But Crouch didn\\'t turn up for the match?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"I think he said he\\'d been too busy.\"\\n\\nSirius paced all around the cave in silence. Then he said, \"Harry, did you check your pockets for your wand after you\\'d left the Top Box?\"\\n\\n\"Erm . . .\" Harry thought hard. \"No,\" he said finally. \"I didn\\'t need to use it before we got in the forest. And then I put my hand in my pocket, and all that was in there were my Omnioculars.\" He stared at Sirius. \"Are you saying whoever\\n\\nconjured the Mark stole my wand in the Top Box?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s possible,\" said Sirius.\\n\\n\"Winky didn\\'t steal that wand!\" Hermione insisted.\\n\\n\"The elf wasn\\'t the only one in that box,\" said Sirius, his brow furrowed as he continued to pace. \"Who else was sitting behind you?\"\\n\\n\"Loads of people,\" said Harry. \"Some Bulgarian ministers .. . Cornelius Fudge ...\\n\\nthe Malfoys ...\"\\n\\n\"The Malfoys!\" said Ron suddenly, so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave, and Buckbeak tossed his head nervously. \"I bet it was Lucius Malfoy!\"\\n\\n\"Anyone else?\" said Sirius.\\n\\n\"No one,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Yes, there was, there was Ludo Bagman,\" Hermione reminded him.\\n\\n\"Oh yeah . . .\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps,\" said Sirius, still pacing. \"What\\'s he like?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s okay,\" said Harry. \"He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard Tournament.\"\\n\\n\"Does he, now?\" said Sirius, frowning more deeply. \"I wonder why he\\'d do that?\"\\n\\n\"Says he\\'s taken a liking to me,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Hmm,\" said Sirius, looking thoughtful.\\n\\n\"We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared,\" Hermione told Sirius. \"Remember?\" she said to Harry and Ron.\\n\\n\"Yeah, but he didn\\'t stay in the forest, did he?\" said Ron. \"The moment we told him about the riot, he went off to the campsite.\"\\n\\n\"How d\\'you know?\" Hermione shot back. \"How d\\'you know where he Disapparated to?\"\\n\\n\"Come off it,\" said Ron incredulously. \"Are you saying you reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s more likely he did it than Winky,\" said Hermione stubbornly.\\n\\n\"Told you,\" said Ron, looking meaningfully at Sirius, \"told you she\\'s obsessed with house �\"\\n\\nBut Sirius held up a hand to silence Ron.\\n\\n\"When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf had been discovered holding Harry\\'s wand, what did Crouch do?\"\\n\\n\"Went to look in the bushes,\" said Harry, \"but there wasn\\'t anyone else there.\"\\n\\n\"Of course,\" Sirius muttered, pacing up and down, \"of course, he\\'d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf... and then he sacked her?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Hermione in a heated voice, \"he sacked her, just because she hadn\\'t stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled �\"\\n\\n\"Hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf!\" said Ron.\\n\\nSirius shook his head and said, \"She\\'s got the measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron. If you want to know what a mans like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.\"\\n\\nHe ran a hand over his unshaven face, evidently thinking hard.\\n\\n\"All these absences of Barty Crouch\\'s ... he goes to the trouble of making sure his house�elf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup, but doesn\\'t bother to turn up and watch. He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament, and then stops coming to that too. . . . It\\'s not like Crouch. If he\\'s ever taken a day off work because of illness before this, I\\'ll eat Buckbeak.\"\\n\\n\"D\\'you know Crouch, then?\" said Harry.\\n\\nSirius\\'s face darkened. He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a murderer.\\n\\n\"Oh I know Crouch all right,\" he said quietly. \"He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban � without a trial.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Ron and Hermione together.\\n\\n\"You\\'re kidding!\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m not,\" said Sirius, taking another great bite of chicken. \"Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn\\'t you know?\"\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione shook their heads.\\n\\n\"He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,\" said Sirius. \"He\\'s a great wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully magical � and power�hungry. Oh never a Voldemort supporter,\" he said, reading the look on Harrys face. \"No, Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side. But then a lot of people who were against the Dark Side . . . well, you wouldn\\'t understand . . . you\\'re too young. ...\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what my dad said at the World Cup,\" said Ron, with a trace of irritation in his voice. \"Try us, why don\\'t you?\"\\n\\nA grin flashed across Sirius\\'s thin face.\\n\\n\"All right, I\\'ll try you. . . .\" He walked once up the cave, back again, and then said, \"Imagine that Voldemort\\'s powerful now. You don\\'t know who his supporters are, you don\\'t know who\\'s working for him and who isn\\'t; you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves. You\\'re scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends. Every week, news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing . . . the Ministry of Magic\\'s in disarray, they don\\'t know what to do, they\\'re trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too. Terror everywhere . . .\\n\\npanic . . . confusion . . . that\\'s how it used to be.\\n\\n\"Well, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others.\\n\\nCrouch\\'s principles might\\'ve been good in the beginning � I wouldn\\'t know. He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemorts supporters. The Aurors were given new powers � powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn\\'t the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side. He had his supporters, mind you � plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic. When Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job. But then something rather unfortunate happened. ...\" Sirius smiled grimly. \"Crouch\\'s own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who\\'d managed to talk their way out of Azkaban. Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power.\"\\n\\n\"Crouch\\'s son was caught?\" gasped Hermione.\\n\\n\"Yep,\" said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak, flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half. \"Nasty little shock for old Barty, I\\'d imagine. Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family, shouldn\\'t he? Ought to have left the office early once in a while . . .\\n\\ngotten to know his own son.\"\\n\\nHe began to wolf down large pieces of bread.\\n\\n\"Was his son a Death Eater?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"No idea,\" said Sirius, still stuffing down bread. \"I was in Azkaban myself when he was brought in. This is mostly stuff I\\'ve found out since I got out. The boy was definitely caught in the company of people I\\'d bet my life were Death Eaters � but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like the house�elf.\"\\n\\n\"Did Crouch try and get his son off?\" Hermione whispered.\\n\\nSirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark.\\n\\n\"Crouch let his son off? I thought you had the measure of him, Hermione!\\n\\nAnything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic. You saw him dismiss a devoted house� elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again � doesn\\'t that tell you what he\\'s like? Crouch\\'s fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial, and by all accounts, it wasn\\'t much more than an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the boy . . . then he sent him straight to Azkaban.\"\\n\\n\"He gave his own son to the dementors?\" asked Harry quietly.\\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" said Sirius, and he didn\\'t look remotely amused now. \"I saw the dementors bringing him in, watched them through the bars in my cell door. He can\\'t have been more than nineteen. They took him into a cell near mine. He was screaming for his mother by nightfall. He went quiet after a few days, though . .\\n\\n.they all went quiet in the end. . . except when they shrieked in their sleep. ...\"\\n\\nFor a moment, the deadened look in Sirius\\'s eyes became more pronounced than ever, as though shutters had closed behind them.\\n\\n\"So he\\'s still in Azkaban?\" Harry said.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Sirius dully. \"No, he\\'s not in there anymore. He died about a year after they brought him in.\"\\n\\n\"He died?\"\\n\\n\"He wasn\\'t the only one,\" said Sirius bitterly. \"Most go mad in there, and plenty stop eating in the end. They lose the will to live. You could always tell when a death was coming, because the dementors could sense it, they got excited. That boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived. Crouch being an important Ministry member, he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit. That was the last time I saw Barty Crouch, half carrying his wife past my cell. She died herself, apparently, shortly afterward. Grief. Wasted away just like the boy. Crouch never came for his sons body. The dementors buried him outside the fortress; I watched them do it.\"\\n\\nSirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it.\\n\\n\"So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made,\" he continued, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. \"One moment, a hero, poised to become Minister of Magic...next, his son dead, his wife dead, the family name dishonored, and, so I\\'ve heard since I escaped, a big drop in popularity. Once the boy had died, people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray.\\n\\nThe conclusion was that his father never cared much for him. So Cornelius Fudge got the top job, and Crouch was shunted sideways into the Department of International Magical Cooperation.\"\\n\\nThere was a long silence. Harry was thinking of the way Crouch\\'s eyes had bulged as he\\'d looked down at his disobedient house�elf back in the wood at the Quidditch World Cup. This, then, must have been why Crouch had overreacted to Winky being found beneath the Dark Mark. It had brought back memories of his son, and the old scandal, and his fall from grace at the Ministry.\\n\\n\"Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards,\" Harry told Sirius.\\n\\n\"Yeah, I\\'ve heard it\\'s become a bit of a mania with him,\" said Sirius, nodding. \"If you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more Death Eater.\"\\n\\n\"And he sneaked up here to search Snape\\'s office!\" s aid Ron triumphantly, looking at Hermione.\\n\\n\"Yes, and that doesn\\'t make sense at all,\" said Sirius.\\n\\n\"Yeah, it does!\" said Ron excitedly, but Sirius shook his head.\\n\\n\"Listen, if Crouch wants to investigate Snape, why hasn\\'t he been coming to judge the tournament? It would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to Hogwarts and keep an eye on him.\"\\n\\n\"So you think Snape could be up to something, then?\" asked Harry, but Hermione broke in.\\n\\n\"Look, I don\\'t care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape �\"\\n\\n\"Oh give it a rest, Hermione,\" said Ron impatiently. \"I know Dumbledores brilliant and everything, but that doesn\\'t mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn\\'t fool him �\"\\n\\n\"Why did Snape save Harry\\'s life in the first year, then? Why didn\\'t he just let him die?\"\\n\\n\"I dunno � maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out�\"\\n\\n\"What d\\'you think, Sirius?\" Harry said loudly, and Ron and Hermione stopped bickering to listen.\\n\\n\"I think they\\'ve both got a point,\" said Sirius, looking thoughtfully at Ron and Hermione. \"Ever since I found out Snape was teaching here, I\\'ve wondered why Dumbledore hired him. Snape\\'s always been fascinated by the Dark Arts, he was famous for it at school. Slimy, oily, greasy�haired kid, he was,\" Sirius added, and Harry and Ron grinned at each other. \"Snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year, and he was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters.\"\\n\\nSirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names.\\n\\n\"Rosier and Wilkes � they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort\\n\\nfell. The Lestranges � they\\'re a married couple � they\\'re in Azkaban. Avery � from what I\\'ve heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he\\'d been acting under the Imperius Curse � he\\'s still at large. But as far as I know, Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater � not that that means much. Plenty of them were never caught. And Snape s certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble.\"\\n\\n\"Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet,\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Yeah, you should\\'ve seen Snape\\'s face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday!\" said Harry quickly. \"Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says Snape\\'s been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked really worried. He showed Snape something on his arm, but I couldn\\'t see what it was.\"\\n\\nHe showed Snape something on his arm?\" said Sirius, looking frankly bewildered.\\n\\nHe ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair, then shrugged again. \"Well, I\\'ve no idea what that\\'s about. . . but if Karkaroff s genuinely worried, and he\\'s going to Snape for answers ...\"\\n\\nSirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of frustration.\\n\\n\"There\\'s still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape, and I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people wouldn\\'t, but I just can\\'t see him letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he\\'d ever worked for Voldemort.\"\\n\\n\"Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snapes office then?\" said Ron stubbornly.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Sirius slowly, \"I wouldn\\'t put it past Mad�Eye to have searched every single teacher\\'s office when he got to Hogwarts. He takes his Defense Against the Dark Arts seriously, Moody. I\\'m not sure he trusts anyone at all, and after the things he\\'s seen, it\\'s not surprising. I\\'ll say this for Moody, though, he never killed if he could help it. Always brought people in alive where possible. He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters. Crouch, though . . . he\\'s a different matter ... is he really ill? If he is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to Snape\\'s office? And if he\\'s not. . . what\\'s he up to? What was he doing at the World Cup that was so important he didn\\'t turn up in the Top Box!\\n\\nWhat\\'s he been doing while he should have been judging the tournament?\"\\n\\nSirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall. Buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky floor, looking for bones he might have overlooked. Finally, Sirius looked up at Ron.\\n\\n\"You say your brother s Crouch\\'s personal assistant? Any chance you could ask him if he\\'s seen Crouch lately?\"\\n\\n\"I can try,\" said Ron doubtfully. \"Better not make it sound like I reckon Crouch is up to anything dodgy, though. Percy loves Crouch.\"\\n\\n\"And you might try and find out whether they\\'ve got any leads on Bertha Jorkins while you\\'re at it,\" said Sirius, gesturing to the second copy of the Daily Prophet.\\n\\n\"Bagman told me they hadn\\'t,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Yes, he\\'s quoted in the article in there,\" said Sirius, nodding at the paper.\\n\\n\"Blustering on about how bad Bertha\\'s memory is. Well, maybe she\\'s changed since I knew her, but the Bertha I knew wasn\\'t forgetful at all � quite the reverse.\\n\\nShe was a bit dim, but she had an excellent memory for gossip. It used to get her into a lot of trouble; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut. I can see her being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic . . . maybe that\\'s why Bagman didn\\'t bother to look for her for so long. ...\"\\n\\nSirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the time?\"\\n\\nHarry checked his watch, then remembered it hadn\\'t been working since it had spent over an hour in the lake.\\n\\n\"It\\'s half past three,\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"You\\'d better get back to school,\" Sirius said, getting to his feet. \"Now listen . . .\"\\n\\nHe looked particularly hard at Harry. \"I don\\'t want you lot sneaking out of school to see me, all right? Just send notes to me here. I still want to hear about anything odd. But you\\'re not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission; it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you.\"\\n\\n\"No one\\'s tried to attack me so far, except a dragon and a couple of grindylows,\"\\n\\nHarry said, but Sirius scowled at him.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care . . . I\\'ll breathe freely again when this tournament\\'s over, and that\\'s not until June. And don\\'t forget, if you\\'re talking about me among yourselves, call me Snuffles, okay?\"\\n\\nHe handed Harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat Buckbeak good�bye.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll walk to the edge of the village with you,\" said Sirius, \"see if I can scrounge another paper.\"\\n\\nHe transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave, and they walked back down the mountainside with him, across the boulder�strewn ground, and back to the stile. Here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head, before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village. Harry, Ron, and Hermione made their way back into Hogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts.\\n\\n\"Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch?\" Ron said as they walked up the drive to the castle. \"But maybe he doesn\\'t care . . . It\\'d probably just make him admire Crouch even more. Yeah, Percy loves rules. He\\'d just say Crouch was refusing to break them for his own son.\"\\n\\n\"Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors,\" said Hermione severely.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Ron. \"If he thought we were standing in the way of his career .. . Percy\\'s really ambitious, you know. ...\"\\n\\nThey walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall, where the delicious smells of dinner wafted toward them from the Great Hall.\\n\\n\"Poor old Snuffles,\" said Ron, breathing deeply. \"He must really like you. Harry. .\\n\\n. . Imagine having to live off rats.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY�EIGHT � THE MADNESS OF MR CROUCH\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery after breakfast on Sunday to send a letter to Percy, asking, as Sirius had suggested, whether he had seen Mr.\\n\\nCrouch lately. They used Hedwig, because it had been so long since she\\'d had a job. When they had watched her fly out of sight through the Owlery window, they proceeded down to the kitchen to give Dobby his new socks.\\n\\nThe house�elves gave them a very cheery welcome, bowing and curtsying and bustling around making tea again. Dobby was ecstatic about his present.\\n\\n\"Harry Potter is too good to Dobby!\" he squeaked, wiping large tears out of his enormous eyes.\\n\\n\"You saved my life with that gillyweed, Dobby, you really did,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"No chance of more of those eclairs, is there?\" said Ron, who was looking around at the beaming and bowing house�elves.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve just had breakfast!\" said Hermione irritably, but a great silver platter of eclairs was already zooming toward them, supported by four elves.\\n\\n\"We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles,\" Harry muttered.\\n\\n\"Good idea,\" said Ron. \"Give Pig something to do. You couldn\\'t give us a bit of extra food, could you?\" he said to the surrounding elves, and they bowed delightedly and hurried off to get some more.\\n\\n\"Dobby, where\\'s Winky?\" said Hermione, who was looking around.\\n\\n\"Winky is over there by the fire, miss,\" said Dobby quietly, his ears drooping slightly.\\n\\n\"Oh dear,\" said Hermione as she spotted Winky.\\n\\nHarry looked over at the fireplace too. Winky was sitting on the same stool as last time, but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not immediately distinguishable from the smoke�blackened brick behind her. Her clothes were ragged and unwashed. She was clutching a bottle of butterbeer and swaying slightly on her stool, staring into the fire. As they watched her, she gave an enormous hiccup.\\n\\n\"Winky is getting through six bottles a day now,\" Dobby whispered to Harry.\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s not strong, that stuff,\" Harry said.\\n\\nBut Dobby shook his head. \"\\'Tis strong for a house�elf, sir,\" he said.\\n\\nWinky hiccuped again. The elves who had brought the eclairs gave her disapproving looks as they returned to work.\\n\\n\"Winky is pining, Harry Potter,\" Dobby whispered sadly. \"Winky wants to go home. Winky still thinks Mr. Crouch is her master, sir, and nothing Dobby says will persuade her that Professor Dumbledore is her master now.\"\\n\\n\"Hey, Winky,\" said Harry, struck by a sudden inspiration, walking over to her, and bending down, \"you don\\'t know what Mr. Crouch might be up to, do you? Because he\\'s stopped turning up to judge the Triwizard Tournament.\"\\n\\nWinky\\'s eyes flickered. Her enormous pupils focused on Harry. She swayed slightly again and then said, \"M � Master is stopped � hic � coming?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"we haven\\'t seen him since the first task. The Daily Prophet\\'s saying he\\'s ill.\"\\n\\nWinky swayed some more, staring blurrily at Harry.\\n\\n\"Master� hic� ill?\"\\n\\nHer bottom lip began to tremble.\\n\\n\"But we\\'re not sure if that\\'s true,\" said Hermione quickly.\\n\\n\"Master is needing his � hie � Winky!\" whimpered the elf. \"Master cannot � hic � manage � hic � all by himself. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Other people manage to do their own housework, you know, Winky,\" Hermione said severely.\\n\\n\"Winky � hic � is not only � hic � doing housework for Mr. Crouch!\" Winky squeaked indignantly, swaying worse than ever and slopping butterbeer down her already heavily stained blouse. \"Master is � hic � trusting Winky with � hic � the most important � hic � the most secret...\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry.\\n\\nBut Winky shook her head very hard, spilling more butterbeer down herself.\\n\\n\"Winky keeps � hic � her master\\'s secrets,\" she said mutinously, swaying very heavily now, frowning up at Harry with her eyes crossed. \"You is � hic � nosing, you is.\"\\n\\n\"Winky must not talk like that to Harry Potter!\" said Dobby angrily. \"Harry Potter is brave and noble and Harry Potter is not nosy!\"\\n\\n\"He is nosing � hic � into my master\\'s � hic � private and secret � hic � Winky is a good house�elf� hic � Winky keeps her silence � hic � people trying to � hic � pry and poke � hic �\"\\n\\nWinky\\'s eyelids drooped and suddenly, without warning, she slid off her stool into the hearth, snoring loudly. The empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away across the stone�flagged floor. Half a dozen house�elves came hurrying forward, looking disgusted. One of them picked up the bottle; the others covered Winky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly, hiding her from view.\\n\\n\"We is sorry you had to see that, sirs and miss!\" squeaked a nearby elf, shaking his head and looking very ashamed. \"We is hoping you will not judge us all by Winky, sirs and miss!\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s unhappy!\" said Hermione, exasperated. \"Why don\\'t you try and cheer her up instead of covering her up?\"\\n\\n\"Begging your pardon, miss,\" said the house�elf, bowing deeply again, \"but house� elves has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and masters to be served.\"\\n\\n\"Oh for heavens sake!\" Hermione cried. \"Listen to me, all of you! You\\'ve got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy! You\\'ve got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes, you don\\'t have to do everything you\\'re told � look at Dobby!\"\\n\\n\"Miss will please keep Dobby out of this,\" Dobby mumbled, looking scared. The cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the house�elves around the kitchen.\\n\\nThey were suddenly looking at Hermione as though she were mad and dangerous.\\n\\n\"We has your extra food!\" squeaked an elf at Harry\\'s elbow, and he shoved a large ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into Harry\\'s arms. \"Good�bye!\"\\n\\nThe house�elves crowded around Harry, Ron, and Hermione and began shunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of their backs.\\n\\n\"Thank you for the socks, Harry Potter!\" Dobby called miserably from the hearth, where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was Winky.\\n\\n\"You couldn\\'t keep your mouth shut, could you, Hermione?\" said Ron angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them. \"They won\\'t want us visiting them now! We could\\'ve tried to get more stuff out of Winky about Crouch!\"\\n\\n\"Oh as if you care about that!\" scoffed Hermione. \"You only like coming down here for the food!\"\\n\\nIt was an irritable sort of day after that. Harry got so tired of Ron and Hermione sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that he took Sirius\\'s food up to the Owlery that evening on his own.\\n\\nPigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the mountain by himself, so Harry enlisted the help of two school screech owls as well. When they had set off into the dusk, looking extremely odd carrying the large package between them. Harry leaned on the windowsill, looking out at the grounds, at the\\n\\ndark, rustling treetops of the Forbidden Forest, and the rippling sails of the Durmstrang ship. An eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from Hagrids chimney; it soared toward the castle, around the Owlery, and out of sight. Looking down, Harry saw Hagrid digging energetically in front of his cabin. Harry wondered what he was doing; it looked as though he were making a new vegetable patch. As he watched, Madame Maxime emerged from the Beauxbatons carriage and walked over to Hagrid. She appeared to be trying to engage him in conversation. Hagrid leaned upon his spade, but did not seem keen to prolong their talk, because Madame Maxime returned to the carriage shortly afterward.\\n\\nUnwilling to go back to Gryffindor Tower and listen to Ron and Hermione snarling at each other, Harry watched Hagrid digging until the darkness swallowed him and the owls around Harry began to awake, swooshing past him into the night.\\n\\nBy breakfast the next day Ron\\'s and Hermione\\'s bad moods had burnt out, and to Harrys relief, Ron\\'s dark predictions that the house�elves would send substandard food up to the Gryffindor table because Hermione had insulted them proved false; the bacon, eggs, and kippers were quite as good as usual.\\n\\nWhen the post owls arrived, Hermione looked up eagerly; she seemed to be expecting something.\\n\\n\"Percy won\\'t\\'ve had time to answer yet,\" said Ron. \"We only sent Hedwig yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s not that,\" said Hermione. \"I\\'ve taken out a subscription to the Daily Prophet. I\\'m getting sick of finding everything out from the Slytherins.\"\\n\\n\"Good thinking!\" said Harry, also looking up at the owls. \"Hey, Hermione, I think you\\'re in luck �\"\\n\\nA gray owl was soaring down toward Hermione.\\n\\n\"It hasn\\'t got a newspaper, though,\" she said, looking disappointed. \"It\\'s �\"\\n\\nBut to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front of her plate, closely followed by four barn owls, a brown owl, and a tawny.\\n\\n\"How many subscriptions did you take out?\" said Harry, seizing Hermione\\'s goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls, all of whom were jostling close to her, trying to deliver their own letter first.\\n\\n\"What on earth � ?\" Hermione said, taking the letter from the gray owl, opening it, and starting to read. \"Oh really!\" she sputtered, going rather red.\\n\\n\"What\\'s up?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"It,\\'s � oh how ridiculous �\"\\n\\nShe thrust the letter at Harry, who saw that it was not handwritten, but composed\\n\\nfrom pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the Daily Prophet.\\n\\nYOU ARE A WICKED GIRL. HARRY POTTER DESERVES BETTER. GO BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM MUGGLE.\\n\\n\"They\\'re all like it!\" said Hermione desperately, opening one letter after another.\\n\\n\"\\'Harry Potter can do much better than the likes of you. . . .\\' \\'You deserve to be boiled in frog spawn. . . .\\' Ouch!\"\\n\\nShe had opened the last envelope, and yellowish�green liquid smelling strongly of petrol gushed over her hands, which began to erupt in large yellow boils.\\n\\n\"Undiluted bubotuber pus!\" said Ron, picking up the envelope gingerly and sniffing it.\\n\\n\"Ow!\" said Hermione, tears starting in her eyes as she tried to rub the pus off her hands with a napkin, but her fingers were now so thickly covered in painful sores that it looked as though she were wearing a pair of thick, knobbly gloves.\\n\\n\"You\\'d better get up to the hospital wing,\" said Harry as the owls around Hermione took flight. \"We\\'ll tell Professor Sprout where you\\'ve gone. . . .\"\\n\\n\"I warned her!\" said Ron as Hermione hurried out of the Great Hall, cradling her hands. \"I warned her not to annoy Rita Skeeter! Look at this one ...\" He read out one of the letters Hermione had left behind: \"I read In Witch Weekly about how you are playing Harry Potter false and that boy has had enough hardship and I will be sending you a curse by next post as soon as I can find a big enough envelope.\\' Blimey, she\\'d better watch out for herself.\"\\n\\nHermione didn\\'t turn up for Herbology. As Harry and Ron left the greenhouse for their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle descending the stone steps of the castle. Pansy Parkinson was whispering and giggling behind them with her gang of Slytherin girls. Catching sight of Harry, Pansy called, \"Potter, have you split up with your girlfriend? Why was she so upset at breakfast?\"\\n\\nHarry ignored her; he didn\\'t want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the Witch Weekly article had caused.\\n\\nHagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns, was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet.\\n\\nHarrys heart sank at the sight of the crates � surely not another skrewt hatching? � but when he got near enough to see inside, he found himself looking at a number of flurry black creatures with long snouts. Their front paws were curiously flat, like spades, and they were blinking up at the class, looking politely puzzled at all the attention.\\n\\n\"These\\'re nifflers,\" said Hagrid, when the class had gathered around. \"Yeh find \\'em down mines mostly. They like sparkly stuff. . . . There yeh go, look.\"\\n\\nOne of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite Pansy Parkinson\\'s watch off her wrist. She shrieked and jumped backward.\\n\\n\"Useful little treasure detectors,\" said Hagrid happily. \"Thought we\\'d have some fun with \\'em today. See over there?\" He pointed at the large patch of freshly turned earth Harry had watched him digging from the Owlery window. \"I\\'ve buried some gold coins. I\\'ve got a prize fer whoever picks the niffler that digs up most. Jus\\' take off all yer valuables, an\\' choose a niffler, an get ready ter set \\'em loose.\"\\n\\nHarry took off his watch, which he was only wearing out of habit, as it didn\\'t work anymore, and stuffed it into his pocket. Then he picked up a niffler. It put its long snout in Harry\\'s ear and sniffed enthusiastically. It was really quite cuddly.\\n\\n\"Hang on,\" said Hagrid, looking down into the crate, \"there\\'s a spare niffler here . .\\n\\n. who\\'s missin? Where\\'s Hermione?\"\\n\\n\"She had to go to the hospital wing,\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll explain later,\" Harry muttered; Pansy Parkinson was listening.\\n\\nIt was easily the most fun they had ever had in Care of Magical Creatures. The nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as though it were water, each scurrying back to the student who had released it and spitting gold into their hands. Ron\\'s was particularly efficient; it had soon filled his lap with coins.\\n\\n\"Can you buy these as pets, Hagrid?\" he asked excitedly as his niffler dived back into the soil, splattering his robes.\\n\\n\"Yer mum wouldn\\' be happy, Ron,\" said Hagrid, grinning. \"They wreck houses, nifflers. I reckon they\\'ve nearly got the lot, now,\" he added, pacing around the patch of earth while the nifflers continued to dive. \"I on\\'y buried a hundred coins.\\n\\nOh there y\\'are, Hermione!\"\\n\\nHermione was walking toward them across the lawn. Her hands were very heavily bandaged and she looked miserable. Pansy Parkinson was watching her beadily.\\n\\n\"Well, let\\'s check how yeh\\'ve done!\" said Hagrid. \"Count yer coins! An\\' there\\'s no point tryin\\' ter steal any, Goyle,\" he added, his beetle�black eyes narrowed. \"It\\'s leprechaun gold. Vanishes after a few hours.\"\\n\\nGoyle emptied his pockets, looking extremely sulky. It turned out that Ron\\'s niffler had been most successful, so Hagrid gave him an enormous slab of Honeydukes chocolate for a prize. The bell rang across the grounds for lunch; the rest of the class set off back to the castle, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione stayed behind to help Hagrid put the nifflers back in their boxes. Harry noticed Madame Maxime watching them out other carriage window.\\n\\n\"What yeh done ter your hands, Hermione?\" said Hagrid, looking concerned.\\n\\nHermione told him about the hate mail she had received that morning, and the envelope full of bubotuber pus.\\n\\n\"Aaah, don worry,\" said Hagrid gendy, looking down at her. \"I got some o\\' those letters an all, after Rita Skeeter wrote abou me mum. \\'Yeh\\'re a monster an yeh should be put down.\\' \\'Yer mother killed innocent people an if you had any decency you d jump in a lake.\\'�\\n\\n\"No!\" said Hermione, looking shocked.\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, heaving the niffler crates over by his cabin wall. \"They\\'re jus\\' nutters, Hermione. Don\\' open \\'em if yeh get any more. Chuck \\'em straigh\\' in the fire.\"\\n\\n\"You missed a really good lesson,\" Harry told Hermione as they headed back toward the castle. \"They\\'re good, nifflers, aren\\'t they, Ron?\"\\n\\nRon, however, was frowning at the chocolate Hagrid had given him. He looked thoroughly put out about something.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" said Harry. \"Wrong flavor?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ron shortly. \"Why didn\\'t you tell me about the gold?\"\\n\\n\"What gold?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"The gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup,\" said Ron. \"The leprechaun gold I gave you for my Omnioculars. In the Top Box. Why didn\\'t you tell me it disappeared?\"\\n\\nHarry had to think for a moment before he realized what Ron was talking about.\\n\\n\"Oh . . .\" he said, the memory coming back to him at last. \"I dunno ... I never noticed it had gone. I was more worried about my wand, wasn\\'t I?\"\\n\\nThey climbed the steps into the entrance hall and went into the Great Hall for lunch.\\n\\n\"Must be nice,\" Ron said abruptly, when they had sat down and started serving themselves roast beef and Yorkshire puddings. \"To have so much money you don\\'t notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing.\"\\n\\n\"Listen, I had other stuff on my mind that night!\" s aid Harry impatiently. \"We all did, remember?\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know leprechaun gold vanishes,\" Ron muttered. \"I thought I was paying you back. You shouldn\\'t\\'ve given me that Chudley Cannon hat for Christmas.\"\\n\\n\"Forget it, all right?\" said Harry.\\n\\nRon speared a roast potato on the end of his fork, glaring at it. Then he said, \"I\\n\\nhate being poor.\"\\n\\nHarry and Hermione looked at each other. Neither of them really knew what to say.\\n\\n\"It\\'s rubbish,\" said Ron, still glaring down at his potato. \"I don\\'t blame Fred and George for trying to make some extra money. Wish I could. Wish I had a niffler.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we know what to get you next Christmas,\" said Hermione brightly. Then, when Ron continued to look gloomy, she said, \"Come on, Ron, it could be worse.\\n\\nAt least your fingers aren\\'t full of pus.\" Hermione was having a lot of difficulty managing her knife and fork, her fingers were so stiff and swollen. \"I hate that Skeeter woman!\" she burst out savagely. \"I\\'ll get her back for this if it\\'s the last thing I do!\"\\n\\nHate mail continued to arrive for Hermione over the following week, and although she followed Hagrid\\'s advice and stopped opening it, several of her ill�wishers sent Howlers, which exploded at the Gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the whole Hall to hear. Even those people who didn\\'t read Witch Weekly knew all about the supposed Harry�Krum�Hermione triangle now. Harry was getting sick of telling people that Hermione wasn\\'t his girlfriend.\\n\\n\"It\\'ll die down, though,\" he told Hermione, \"if we just ignore it. ... People got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time \"I want to know how she\\'s listening into private conversations when she\\'s supposed to be banned from the grounds!\" said Hermione angrily.\\n\\nHermione hung back in their next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson to ask Professor Moody something. The rest of the class was very eager to leave; Moody had given them such a rigorous test of hex�deflection that many of them were nursing small injuries. Harry had such a bad case of Twitchy Ears, he had to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the class.\\n\\n\"Well, Rita\\'s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak!\" Hermione panted five minutes later, catching up with Harry and Ron in the entrance hall and pulling Harrys hand away from one of his wiggling ears so that he could hear her. \"Moody says he didn\\'t see her anywhere near the judges\\' table at the second task, or anywhere near the lake!\"\\n\\n\"Hermione, is there any point in telling you to drop this?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"No!\" said Hermione stubbornly. \"I want to know how she heard me talking to Viktor! And how she found out about Hagrids mum!\"\\n\\n\"Maybe she had you bugged,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Bugged?\" said Ron blankly. \"What. . . put fleas on her or something?\"\\n\\nHarry started explaining about hidden microphones and recording equipment. Ron\\n\\nwas fascinated, but Hermione interrupted them.\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you two ever going to read Hogwarts, A History^\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the point?\" said Ron. \"You know it by heart, we can just ask you.\"\\n\\n\"All those substitutes for magic Muggles use � electricity, computers, and radar, and all those things � they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there\\'s too much magic in the air. No, Rita\\'s using magic to eavesdrop, she must be. ... If I could just find out what it is ... ooh, if it\\'s illegal, I\\'ll have her ...\"\\n\\n\"Haven\\'t we got enough to worry about?\" Ron asked her. \"Do we have to start a vendetta against Rita Skeeter as well?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not asking you to help!\" Hermione snapped. \"I\\'ll do it on my own!\"\\n\\nShe marched back up the marble staircase without a backward glance. Harry was quite sure she was going to the library.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the betting she comes back with a box of / Hate Rita Skeeter badges?\"\\n\\nsaid Ron.\\n\\nHermione, however, did not ask Harry and Ron to help her pursue vengeance against Rita Skeeter, for which they were both grateful, because their workload was mounting ever higher in the days before the Easter holidays. Harry frankly marveled at the fact that Hermione could research magical methods of eavesdropping as well as everything else they had to do. He was working flat�out just to get through all their homework, though he made a point of sending regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain for Sirius; after last summer, Harry had not forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry. He enclosed notes to Sirius, telling him that nothing out of the ordinary had happened, and that they were still waiting for an answer from Percy.\\n\\nHedwig didn\\'t return until the end of the Easter holidays. Percy\\'s letter was enclosed in a package of Easter eggs that Mrs. Weasley had sent. Both Harrys and Ron\\'s were the size of dragon eggs and full of homemade toffee. Hermiones, however, was smaller than a chicken egg. Her face fell when she saw it.\\n\\n\"Your mum doesn\\'t read Witch Weekly, by any chance, does she, Ron?\" she asked quietly.\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron, whose mouth was full of toffee. \"Gets it for the recipes.\"\\n\\nHermione looked sadly at her tiny egg.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you want to see what Percy\\'s written?\" Harry asked her hastily.\\n\\nPercys letter was short and irritated.\\n\\nAs I am constantly telling the Daily Prophet, Mr. Crouch is taking a well�deserved break. He is sending in regular owls with instructions. No, I haven\\'t actually seen\\n\\nhim, but I think I can be trusted to know my own superior\\'s handwriting. I have quite enough to do at the moment without trying to quash these ridiculous rumors.\\n\\nPlease don\\'t bother me again unless it\\'s something important. Happy Easter.\\n\\nThe start of the summer term would normally have meant that Harry was training hard for the last Quidditch match of the season. This year, however, it was the third and final task in the Triwizard Tournament for which he needed to prepare, but he still didn\\'t know what he would have to do. Finally, in the last week of May, Professor McGonagall held him back in Transfiguration.\\n\\n\"You are to go down to the Quidditch field tonight at nine o\\'clock. Potter,\" she told him. \"Mr. Bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third task.\"\\n\\nSo at half past eight that night. Harry left Ron and Hermione in Gryffindor Tower and went downstairs. As he crossed the entrance hall, Cedric came up from the Hufflepuff common room.\\n\\n\"What d\\'you reckon it\\'s going to be?\" he asked Harry as they went together down the stone steps, out into the cloudy night. \"Fleur keeps going on about underground tunnels; she reckons we\\'ve got to find treasure.\"\\n\\n\"That wouldn\\'t be too bad,\" said Harry, thinking that he would simply ask Hagrid for a niffler to do the job for him.\\n\\nThey walked down the dark lawn to the Quidditch stadium, turned through a gap in the stands, and walked out onto the field.\\n\\n\"What\\'ve they done to it?\" Cedric said indignantly, stopping dead.\\n\\nThe Quidditch field was no longer smooth and flat. It looked as though somebody had been building long, low walls all over it that twisted and crisscrossed in every direction.\\n\\n\"They\\'re hedges!\" said Harry, bending to examine the nearest one.\\n\\n\"Hello there!\" called a cheery voice.\\n\\nLudo Bagman was standing in the middle of the field with Krum and Fleur. Harry and Cedric made their way toward them, climbing over the hedges. Fleur beamed at Harry as he came nearer. Her attitude toward him had changed completely since he had saved her sister from the lake.\\n\\n\"Well, what d\\'you think?\" said Bagman happily as Harry and Cedric climbed over the last hedge. \"Growing nicely, aren\\'t they? Give them a month and Hagrid\\'ll have them twenty feet high. Don\\'t worry,\" he added, grinning, spotting the less� than�happy expressions on Harrys and Cedric\\'s faces, \"you\\'ll have your Quidditch field back to normal once the task is over! Now, I imagine you can guess what we\\'re making here?\"\\n\\nNo one spoke for a moment. Then �\\n\\n\"Maze,\" grunted Krum.\\n\\n\"That\\'s right!\" said Bagman. \"A maze. The third task\\'s really very straightforward.\\n\\nThe Triwizard Cup will be placed in the center of the maze. The first champion to touch it will receive full marks.\"\\n\\n\"We seemply \\'ave to get through the maze?\" said Fleur.\\n\\n\"There will be obstacles,\" said Bagman happily, bouncing on the balls of his feet.\\n\\n\"Hagrid is providing a number of creatures . . . then there will be spells that must be broken ... all that sort of thing, you know. Now, the champions who are leading on points will get a head start into the maze.\" Bagman grinned at Harry and Cedric. \"Then Mr. Krum will enter . . . then Miss Delacour. But you\\'ll all be in with a fighting chance, depending how well you get past the obstacles. Should be fun, eh?\"\\n\\nHarry, who knew only too well the kind of creatures that Hagrid was likely to provide for an event like this, thought it was unlikely to be any fun at all.\\n\\nHowever, he nodded politely like the other champions.\\n\\n\"Very well. . . if you haven\\'t got any questions, we\\'ll go back up to the castle, shall we, it\\'s a bit chilly. ...\"\\n\\nBagman hurried alongside Harry as they began to wend their way out of the growing maze. Harry had the feeling that Bagman was going to start offering to help him again, but just then, Krum tapped Harry on the shoulder.\\n\\n\"Could I haff a vord?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, all right,\" said Harry, slightly surprised.\\n\\n\"Vill you valk vith me?\"\\n\\n\"Okay,\" said Harry curiously.\\n\\nBagman looked slightly perturbed.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll wait for you. Harry, shall I?\"\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s okay, Mr. Bagman,\" said Harry, suppressing a smile, \"I think I can find the castle on my own, thanks.\"\\n\\nHarry and Krum left the stadium together, but Krum did not set a course for the Durmstrang ship. Instead, he walked toward the forest.\\n\\n\"What\\'re we going this way for?\" said Harry as they passed Hagrid s cabin and the illuminated Beauxbatons carriage.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t vont to be overheard,\" said Krum shortly.\\n\\nWhen at last they had reached a quiet stretch of ground a short way from the\\n\\nBeauxbatons horses\\' paddock, Krum stopped in the shade of the trees and turned to face Harry.\\n\\n\"I vant to know,\" he said, glowering, \"vot there is between you and Hermy�own� ninny.\"\\n\\nHarry, who from Krum\\'s secretive manner had expected something much more serious than this, stared up at Krum in amazement.\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" he said. But Krum glowered at him, and Harry, somehow struck anew by how tall Krum was, elaborated. \"We\\'re friends. She\\'s not my girlfriend and she never has been. It\\'s just that Skeeter woman making things up.\"\\n\\n\"Hermy�own�ninny talks about you very often,\" said Krum, looking suspiciously at Harry.\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"because were friends.\"\\n\\nHe couldn\\'t quite believe he was having this conversation with Viktor Krum, the famous International Quidditch player. It was as though the eighteen�year�old Krum thought he. Harry, was an equal � a real rival � \"You haff never . . . you haff not...\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry very firmly.\\n\\nKrum looked slightly happier. He stared at Harry for a few seconds, then said, \"You fly very veil. I vos votching at the first task.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, grinning broadly and suddenly feeling much taller himself.\\n\\n\"I saw you at the Quidditch World Cup. The Wronski Feint, you really �\"\\n\\nBut something moved behind Krum in the trees, and Harry, who had some experience of the sort of thing that lurked in the forest, instinctively grabbed Krum\\'s arm and pulled him around.\\n\\n\"Vot is it?\"\\n\\nHarry shook his head, staring at the place where he\\'d seen movement. He slipped his hand inside his robes, reaching for his wand.\\n\\nSuddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall oak. For a moment, Harry didn\\'t recognize him . . . then he realized it was Mr. Crouch.\\n\\nHe looked as though he had been traveling for days. The knees of his robes were ripped and bloody, his face scratched; he was unshaven and gray with exhaustion.\\n\\nHis neat hair and mustache were both in need of a wash and a trim. His strange appearance, however, was nothing to the way he was behaving. Muttering and gesticulating, Mr. Crouch appeared to be talking to someone that he alone could see. He reminded Harry vividly of an old tramp he had seen once when out shopping with the Dursleys. That man too had been conversing wildly with thin\\n\\nair; Aunt Petunia had seized Dudley\\'s hand and pulled him across the road to avoid him; Uncle Vernon had then treated the family to a long rant about what he would like to do with beggars and vagrants.\\n\\n\"Vosn\\'t he a judge?\" said Krum, staring at Mr. Crouch. \"Isn\\'t he vith your Ministry?\"\\n\\nHarry nodded, hesitated for a moment, then walked slowly toward Mr. Crouch, who did not look at him, but continued to talk to a nearby tree.\\n\\n\"... and when you\\'ve done that, Weatherby, send an owl to Dumbledore confirming the number of Durmstrang students who will be attending the tournament, Karkaroff has just sent word there will be twelve. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Crouch?\" said Harry cautiously.\\n\\n\"... and then send another owl to Madame Maxime, because she might want to up the number of students she\\'s bringing, now Karkaroff\\'s made it a round dozen ...\\n\\ndo that, Weatherby, will you? Will you? Will...\"\\n\\nMr. Crouch\\'s eyes were bulging. He stood staring at the tree, muttering soundlessly at it. Then he staggered sideways and fell to his knees.\\n\\n\"Mr. Crouch?\" Harry said loudly. \"Are you all right?\"\\n\\nCrouch\\'s eyes were rolling in his head. Harry looked around at Krum, who had followed him into the trees, and was looking down at Crouch in alarm.\\n\\n\"Vot is wrong with him?\"\\n\\n\"No idea,\" Harry muttered. \"Listen, you\\'d better go and get someone �\"\\n\\n\"Dumbledore!\" gasped Mr. Crouch. He reached out and seized a handful of Harrys robes, dragging him closer, though his eyes were staring over Harry\\'s head. \"I need... see ... Dumbledore. ...\"\\n\\n\"Okay,\" said Harry, \"if you get up, Mr. Crouch, we can go up to the�\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve done . . . stupid . . . thing . . .\" Mr. Crouch breathed. He looked utterly mad.\\n\\nHis eyes were rolling and bulging, and a trickle of spittle was sliding down his chin. Every word he spoke seemed to cost him a terrible effort. \"Must. . . tell. . .\\n\\nDumbledore . . .\"\\n\\n\"Get up, Mr. Crouch,\" said Harry loudly and clearly. \"Get up, I\\'ll take you to Dumbledore!\"\\n\\nMr, Crouch\\'s eyes rolled forward onto Harry.\\n\\n\"Who ... you?\" he whispered.\\n\\n\"I\\'m a student at the school,\" said Harry, looking around at Krum for some help,\\n\\nbut Krum was hanging back, looking extremely nervous.\\n\\n\"You\\'re not... his?\" whispered Crouch, his mouth sagging.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry, without the faintest idea what Crouch was talking about.\\n\\n\"Dumbledore\\'s?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" said Harry.\\n\\nCrouch was pulling him closer; Harry tried to loosen Crouch\\'s grip on his robes, but it was too powerful.\\n\\n\"Warn ... Dumbledore ...\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll get Dumbledore if you let go of me,\" said Harry. \"Just let go, Mr. Crouch, and I\\'ll get him.. . .\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Weatherby, and when you have done that, I would like a cup of tea.\\n\\nMy wife and son will be arriving shortly, we are attending a concert tonight with Mr. and Mrs. Fudge.\"\\n\\nCrouch was now talking fluently to a tree again, and seemed completely unaware that Harry was there, which surprised Harry so much he didn\\'t notice that Crouch had released him.\\n\\n\"Yes, my son has recently gained twelve O.W.L.S, most satisfactory, yes, thank you, yes, very proud indeed. Now, if you could bring me that memo from the Andorran Minister of Magic, I think I will have time to draft a response. ...\"\\n\\n\"You stay here with him!\" Harry said to Krum. \"I\\'ll get Dumbledore, I\\'ll be quicker, I know where his office is �\"\\n\\n\"He is mad,\" said Krum doubtfully, staring down at Crouch, who was still gabbling to the tree, apparently convinced it was Percy.\\n\\n\"Just stay with him,\" said Harry, starting to get up, but his movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in Mr. Crouch, who seized him hard around the knees and pulled Harry back to the ground.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t. . . leave .. . me!\" he whispered, his eyes bulging again. \"I... escaped .. .\\n\\nmust warn . . . must tell... see Dumbledore . . . my fault... all my fault. . . Bertha . .\\n\\n. dead ... all my fault. .. my son ... my fault... tell Dumbledore ... Harry Potter ...\\n\\nthe Dark Lord . . . stronger . . . Harry Potter ...\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll get Dumbledore if you let me go, Mr. Crouch!\" said Harry. He looked furiously around at Krum. \"Help me, will you?\"\\n\\nLooking extremely apprehensive, Krum moved forward and squatted down next to Mr. Crouch.\\n\\n\"Just keep him here,\" said Harry, pulling himself free of Mr. Crouch. \"I\\'ll be back with Dumbledore.\"\\n\\n\"Hurry, von\\'t you?\" Krum called after him as Harry sprinted away from the forest and up through the dark grounds. They were deserted; Bagman, Cedric, and Fleur had disappeared. Harry tore up the stone steps, through the oak front doors, and off up the marble staircase, toward the second floor.\\n\\nFive minutes later he was hurtling toward a stone gargoyle standing halfway along an empty corridor.\\n\\n\"Sher � sherbet lemon!\" he panted at it.\\n\\nThis was the password to the hidden staircase to Dumbledore\\'s office � or at least, it had been two years ago. The password had evidently changed, however, for the stone gargoyle did not spring to life and jump aside, but stood frozen, glaring at Harry malevolently.\\n\\n\"Move!\" Harry shouted at it. \"C\\'mon!\"\\n\\nBut nothing at Hogwarts had ever moved just because he shouted at it; he knew it was no good. He looked up and down the dark corridor. Perhaps Dumbledore was in the staffroom? He started running as fast as he could toward the staircase � \"POTTER!\"\\n\\nHarry skidded to a halt and looked around. Snape had just emerged from the hidden staircase behind the stone gargoyle. The wall was sliding shut behind him even as he beckoned Harry back toward him.\\n\\n\"What are you doing here, Potter?\"\\n\\n\"I need to see Professor Dumbledore!\" said Harry, running back up the corridor and skidding to a standstill in front of Snape instead. \"It\\'s Mr. Crouch . . . he\\'s just turned up ... he\\'s in the forest... he\\'s asking �\"\\n\\n\"What is this rubbish?\" said Snape, his black eyes glittering. \"What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Crouch!\" Harry shouted. \"From the Ministry! He\\'s ill or something � he\\'s in the forest, he wants to see Dumbledore! Just give me the password up to �\"\\n\\n\"The headmaster is busy. Potter,\" said Snape, his thin mouth curling into an unpleasant smile.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got to tell Dumbledore!\" Harry yelled.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t you hear me. Potter?\"\\n\\nHarry could tell Snape was thoroughly enjoying himself, denying Harry the thing he wanted when he was so panicky.\\n\\n\"Look,\" said Harry angrily, \"Crouch isn\\'t right � he\\'s � he\\'s out of his mind � he says he wants to warn �\"\\n\\nThe stone wall behind Snape slid open. Dumbledore was standing there, wearing long green robes and a mildly curious expression. \"Is there a problem?\" he said, looking between Harry and Snape.\\n\\n\"Professor!\" Harry said, sidestepping Snape before Snape could speak, \"Mr.\\n\\nCrouch is here � he\\'s down in the forest, he wants to speak to you!\"\\n\\nHarry expected Dumbledore to ask questions, but to his relief, Dumbledore did nothing of the sort.\\n\\n\"Lead the way,\" he said promptly, and he swept off along the corridor behind Harry, leaving Snape standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice as ugly.\\n\\n\"What did Mr. Crouch say. Harry?\" said Dumbledore as they walked swiftly down the marble staircase.\\n\\n\"Said he wants to warn you . . . said he\\'s done something terrible ... he mentioned his son . . . and Bertha Jorkins .. . and � and Voldemort. . . something about Voldemort getting stronger. ...\"\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" said Dumbledore, and he quickened his pace as they hurried out into the pitch�darkness.\\n\\n\"He\\'s not acting normally,\" Harry said, hurrying along beside Dumbledore. \"He doesn\\'t seem to know where he is. He keeps talking like he thinks Percy Weasley\\'s there, and then he changes, and says he needs to see you. ... I left him with Viktor Krum.\"\\n\\n\"You did?\" said Dumbledore sharply, and he began to take longer strides still, so that Harry was running to keep up. \"Do you know if anybody else saw Mr.\\n\\nCrouch?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"Krum and I were talking, Mr. Bagman had just finished telling us about the third task, we stayed behind, and then we saw Mr. Crouch coming out of the forest �\"\\n\\n\"Where are they?\" said Dumbledore as the Beauxbatons carriage emerged from the darkness.\\n\\n\"Over here,\" said Harry, moving in front of Dumbledore, leading the way through the trees. He couldn\\'t hear Crouch\\'s voice anymore, but he knew where he was going; it hadn\\'t been much past the Beauxbatons carriage . . . somewhere around here. . . .\\n\\n\"Viktor?\" Harry shouted.\\n\\nNo one answered.\\n\\n\"They were here,\" Harry said to Dumbledore. \"They were definitely somewhere around here. ...\"\\n\\n\"Lumos,\" Dumbledore said, lighting his wand and holding it up.\\n\\nIts narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black trunk, illuminating the ground.\\n\\nAnd then it fell upon a pair of feet.\\n\\nHarry and Dumbledore hurried forward. Krum was sprawled on the forest floor.\\n\\nHe seemed to be unconscious. There was no sign at all of Mr. Crouch.\\n\\nDumbledore bent over Krum and gently lifted one of his eyelids.\\n\\n\"Stunned,\" he said softly. His half�moon glasses glittered in the wandlight as he peered around at the surrounding trees.\\n\\n\"Should I go and get someone?\" said Harry. \"Madam Pomfrey?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Dumbledore swiftly. \"Stay here.\"\\n\\nHe raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of Hagrid\\'s cabin.\\n\\nHarry saw something silvery dart out of it and streak away through the trees like a ghostly bird. Then Dumbledore bent over Krum again, pointed his wand at him, and muttered, \"Ennervate.\"\\n\\nKrum opened his eyes. He looked dazed. When he saw Dumbledore, he tried to sit up, but Dumbledore put a hand on his shoulder and made him lie still.\\n\\n\"He attacked me!\" Krum muttered, putting a hand up to his head. \"The old madman attacked me! I vos looking around to see vare Potter had gone and he attacked from behind!\"\\n\\n\"Lie still for a moment,\" Dumbledore said.\\n\\nThe sound of thunderous footfalls reached them, and Hagrid came panting into sight with Fang at his heels. He was carrying his crossbow.\\n\\n\"Professor Dumbledore!\" he said, his eyes widening. \"Harry � what the � ?\"\\n\\n\"Hagrid, I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff,\" said Dumbledore. \"His student has been attacked. When you\\'ve done that, kindly alert Professor Moody �\"\\n\\n\"No need, Dumbledore,\" said a wheezy growl. \"I\\'m here.\"\\n\\nMoody was limping toward them, leaning on his staff, his wand lit.\\n\\n\"Damn leg,\" he said furiously. \"Would\\'ve been here quicker . . . what\\'s happened!\\n\\nSnape said something about Crouch �\"\\n\\n\"Crouch?\" said Hagrid blankly.\\n\\n\"Karkaroff, please, Hagrid!\" said Dumbledore sharply.\\n\\n\"Oh yeah . .\\'. right y\\'are, Professor. . .\" said Hagrid, and he turned and disappeared into the dark trees, Fang trotting after him.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know where Barty Crouch is,\" Dumbledore told Moody, \"but it is essential that we find him.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m onto it,\" growled Moody, and he pulled out his wand and limped off into the forest.\\n\\nNeither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke again until they heard the unmistakable sounds of Hagrid and Fang returning. Karkaroff was hurrying along behind them.\\n\\nHe was wearing his sleek silver furs, and he looked pale and agitated.\\n\\n\"What is this?\" he cried when he saw Krum on the ground and Dumbledore and Harry beside him. \"What\\'s going on?\"\\n\\n\"I vos attacked!\" said Krum, sitting up now and rubbing his head. \"Mr. Crouch or votever his name �\"\\n\\n\"Crouch attacked you? Crouch attacked you? The Triwizard judge?\"\\n\\n\"Igor,\" Dumbledore began, but Karkaroff had drawn himself up, clutching his furs around him, looking livid.\\n\\n\"Treachery!\" he bellowed, pointing at Dumbledore. \"It is a plot! You and your Ministry of Magic have lured me here under false pretenses, Dumbledore! This is not an equal competition! First you sneak Potter into the tournament, though he is underage! Now one of your Ministry friends attempts to put my champion out of action! I smell double�dealing and corruption in this whole affair, and you, Dumbledore, you, with your talk of closer international wizarding links, of rebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differences � here\\'s what I think of you!\"\\n\\nKarkaroff spat onto the ground at Dumbledore\\'s feet. In one swift movement, Hagrid seized the front of Karkaroff\\'s furs, lifted him into the air, and slammed him against a nearby tree.\\n\\n\"Apologize!\" Hagrid snarled as Karkaroff gasped for breath, Hagrid\\'s massive fist at his throat, his feet dangling in midair.\\n\\n\"Hagrid, no!\" Dumbledore shouted, his eyes flashing.\\n\\nHagrid removed the hand pinning Karkaroff to the tree, and Karkaroff slid all the way down the trunk and slumped in a huddle at its roots; a few twigs and leaves showered down upon his head.\\n\\n\"Kindly escort Harry back up to the castle, Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore sharply.\\n\\nBreathing heavily, Hagrid gave Karkaroff a glowering look.\\n\\n\"Maybe I\\'d better stay here. Headmaster. . . .\"\\n\\n\"You will take Harry back to school, Hagrid,\" Dumbledore repeated firmly. \"Take him right up to Gryffindor Tower. And Harry � I want you to stay there. Anything you might want to do � any owls you might want to send � they can wait until morning, do you understand me?\"\\n\\n\"Er � yes,\" said Harry, staring at him. How had Dumbledore known that, at that very moment, he had been thinking about sending Pigwidgeon straight to Sirius, to tell him what had happened!\\n\\n\"I\\'ll leave Fang with yeh. Headmaster,\" Hagrid said, staring menacingly at Karkaroff, who was still sprawled at the foot of the tree, tangled in furs and tree roots. \"Stay, Fang. C\\'mon, Harry.\"\\n\\nThey marched in silence past the Beauxbatons carriage and up toward the castle.\\n\\n\"How dare he,\" Hagrid growled as they strode past the lake. \"How dare he accuse Dumbledore. Like Dumbledore\\'d do anythin\\' like that. Like Dumbledore wanted you in the tournament in the firs\\' place. Worried! I dunno when I seen Dumbledore more worried than he\\'s bin lately. An\\' you!\" Hagrid suddenly said angrily to Harry, who looked up at him, taken aback. \"What were yeh doin\\', wanderin\\' off with ruddy Krum? He\\'s from Durmstrang, Harry! Coulda jinxed yeh right there, couldn he? Hasn\\' Moody taught yeh nothin\\'? \\'Magine lettin him lure yeh off on yer own �\"\\n\\n\"Krum\\'s all right!\" said Harry as they climbed the steps into the entrance hall. \"He wasn\\'t trying to jinx me, he just wanted to talk about Hermione �\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be havin\\' a few words with her, an\\' all,\" said Hagrid grimly, stomping up the stairs. \"The less you lot \\'ave ter do with these foreigners, the happier yeh\\'ll be. Yeh can trust any of \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"You were getting on all right with Madame Maxime,\" Harry said, annoyed.\\n\\n\"Don\\' you talk ter me abou\\' her!\" said Hagrid, and he looked quite frightening for a moment. \"I\\'ve got her number now! Tryin\\' ter get back in me good books, tryin\\' ter get me ter tell her what\\'s comin in the third task. Ha! You can\\' trust any of\\'em!\"\\n\\nHagrid was in such a bad mood, Harry was quite glad to say good�bye to him in front of the Fat Lady. He clambered through the portrait hole into the common room and hurried straight for the corner where Ron and Hermione were sitting, to tell them what had happened.\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY�NINE � THE DREAM\\n\\nIt comes down to this,\" said Hermione, rubbing her forehead. \"Either Mr. Crouch attacked Viktor, or somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor wasn\\'t looking.\"\\n\\n\"It must\\'ve been Crouch,\" said Ron at once. \"That\\'s why he was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got there. He\\'d done a runner.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think so,\" said Harry, shaking his head. \"He seemed really weak � I don\\'t reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything.\"\\n\\n\"You cant Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds, haven\\'t I told you enough times?\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"Okay. . . hows this for a theory,\" said Ron excitedly. \"Krum attacked Crouch � no, wait for it � and then Stunned himself!\"\\n\\n\"And Mr. Crouch evaporated, did he?\" said Hermione coldly.\\n\\n\"Oh yeah . . .\"\\n\\nIt was daybreak. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had crept out of their dormitories very early and hurried up to the Owlery together to send a note to Sirius. Now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds. All three of them were puffy�eyed and pale because they had been talking late into the night about Mr. Crouch.\\n\\n\"Just go through it again, Harry,\" said Hermione. \"What did Mr. Crouch actually say?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve told you, he wasn\\'t making much sense,\" said Harry. \"He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something. He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins, and he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying stuff was his fault. . . . He mentioned his son.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that was his fault,\" said Hermione testily.\\n\\n\"He was out of his mind,\" said Harry. \"Half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive, and he kept talking to Percy about work and giving him instructions.\"\\n\\n\"And . . . remind me what he said about You�Know�Who?\" said Ron tentatively.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve told you,\" Harry repeated dully. \"He said he\\'s getting stronger.\"\\n\\nThere was a pause. Then Ron said in a falsely confident voice, \"But he was out of his mind, like you said, so half of it was probably just raving. ...\"\\n\\n\"He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort,\" said Harry, and Ron winced at the sound of the name. \"He was having real trouble stringing two words together, but that was when he seemed to know where he was, and know what he wanted to do. He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore.\"\\n\\nHarry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters. The many perches were half�empty; every now and then, another owl would swoop in through one of the windows, returning from its night\\'s hunting with a mouse in its beak.\\n\\n\"If Snape hadn\\'t held me up,\" Harry said bitterly, \"we might\\'ve got there in time.\\n\\n\\'The headmaster is busy. Potter . . . what\\'s this rubbish, Potter?\\' Why couldn\\'t he have just got out of the way?\"\\n\\n\"Maybe he didn\\'t want you to get there!\" said Ron quickly. \"Maybe � hang on � how fast d\\'you reckon he could\\'ve gotten down to the forest? D\\'you reckon he could\\'ve beaten you and Dumbledore there?\"\\n\\n\"Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t put it past him,\" Ron muttered.\\n\\n\"We need to see Professor Moody,\" said Hermione. \"We need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch,\"\\n\\n\"If he had the Marauder\\'s Map on him, it would\\'ve been easy,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,\" said Ron, \"because it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn\\'t �\"\\n\\n\"Shh!\" said Hermione suddenly.\\n\\nSomebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery. Harry could hear two voices arguing, coming closer and closer.\\n\\n\"� that\\'s blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for that�\"\\n\\n\"� we\\'ve tried being polite; it\\'s time to play dirty, like him. He wouldn\\'t like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did �\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m telling you, if you put that in writing, it\\'s blackmail!\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, and you won\\'t be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff, will you?\"\\n\\nThe Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came over the threshold, then froze at the sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\\n\\n\"What\\'re you doing here?\" Ron and Fred said at the same time.\\n\\n\"Sending a letter,\" said Harry and George in unison.\\n\\n\"What, at this time?\" said Hermione and Fred.\\n\\nFred grinned.\\n\\n\"Fine � we won\\'t ask you what you\\'re doing, if you don\\'t ask us,\" he said.\\n\\nHe was holding a sealed envelope in his hands. Harry glanced at it, but Fred, whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted his hand so that the name on it was covered.\\n\\n\"Well, don\\'t let us hold you up,\" Fred said, making a mock bow and pointing at the door.\\n\\nRon didn\\'t move. \"Who\\'re you blackmailing?\" he said.\\n\\nThe grin vanished from Fred\\'s face. Harry saw George half glance at Fred, before smiling at Ron.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be stupid, I was only joking,\" he said easily.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t sound like that,\" said Ron.\\n\\nFred and George looked at each other. Then Fred said abruptly, \"I\\'ve told you before, Ron, keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is. Can\\'t see why you would, but �\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s my business if you\\'re blackmailing someone,\" said Ron. \"George\\'s right, you could end up in serious trouble for that.\"\\n\\n\"Told you, I was joking,\" said George. He walked over to Fred, pulled the letter out of his hands, and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl. \"You\\'re starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother, you are, Ron. Carry on like this and you\\'ll be made a prefect.\"\\n\\n\"No, I won\\'t!\" said Ron hotly.\\n\\nGeorge carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off. George turned around and grinned at Ron.\\n\\n\"Well, stop telling people what to do then. See you later.\"\\n\\nHe and Fred left the Owlery. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t think they know something about all this, do you?\" Hermione whispered. \"About Crouch and everything?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"If it was something that serious, they\\'d tell someone. They\\'d tell Dumbledore.\"\\n\\nRon, however, was looking uncomfortable.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" Hermione asked him.\\n\\n\"Well. . .\" said Ron slowly, \"I dunno if they would. They\\'re . . . they\\'re obsessed\\n\\nwith making money lately, I noticed it when I was hanging around with them � when � you know �\"\\n\\n\"We weren\\'t talking.\" Harry finished the sentence for him. \"Yeah, but blackmail...\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s this joke shop idea they\\'ve got,\" said Ron. \"I thought they were only saying it to annoy Mum, but they really mean it, they want to start one. They\\'ve only got a year left at Hogwarts, they keep going on about how it\\'s time to think about their future, and Dad can\\'t help them, and they need gold to get started.\"\\n\\nHermione was looking uncomfortable now.\\n\\n\"Yes, but. . . they wouldn\\'t do anything against the law to get gold.\"\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t they?\" said Ron, looking skeptical. \"I dunno . . . they don\\'t exactly mind breaking rules, do they?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but this is the law\" said Hermione, looking scared. \"This isn\\'t some silly school rule. . . . They\\'ll get a lot more than detention for blackmail! Ron. . . maybe you\\'d better tell Percy. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Are you mad?\" said Ron. \"Tell Percy? He\\'d probably do a Crouch and turn them in.\" He stared at the window through which Fred and George\\'s owl had departed, then said, \"Come on, let\\'s get some breakfast.\"\\n\\n\"D\\'you think it\\'s too early to go and see Professor Moody?\" Hermione said as they went down the spiral staircase.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"He\\'d probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn; he\\'ll think we\\'re trying to attack him while he\\'s asleep. Let\\'s give it till break.\"\\n\\nHistory of Magic had rarely gone so slowly. Harry kept checking Ron\\'s watch, having finally discarded his own, but Ron\\'s was moving so slowly he could have sworn it had stopped working too. All three of them were so tired they could happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept; even Hermione wasn\\'t taking her usual notes, but was sitting with her head on her hand, gazing at Professor Binns with her eyes out of focus.\\n\\nWhen the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corridors toward the Dark Arts classroom and found Professor Moody leaving it. He looked as tired as they felt. The eyelid of his normal eye was drooping, giving his face an even more lopsided appearance than usual.\\n\\n\"Professor Moody?\" Harry called as they made their way toward him through the crowd.\\n\\n\"Hello, Potter,\" growled Moody. His magical eye followed a couple of passing first years, who sped up, looking nervous; it rolled into the back of Moody\\'s head and watched them around the corner before he spoke again.\\n\\n\"Come in here.\"\\n\\nHe stood back to let them into his empty classroom, limped in after them, and closed the door.\\n\\n\"Did you find him?\" Harry asked without preamble. \"Mr. Crouch?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Moody. He moved over to his desk, sat down, stretched out his wooden leg with a slight groan, and pulled out his hip flask.\\n\\n\"Did you use the map?\" Harry said.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said Moody, taking a swig from his flask. \"Took a leaf out of your book, Potter. Summoned it from my office into the forest. He wasn\\'t anywhere on there.\"\\n\\n\"So he did Disapparate?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t Disapparate on the grounds, Ron!\" said Hermione. \"There are other ways he could have disappeared, aren\\'t there, Professor?\"\\n\\nMoody\\'s magical eye quivered as it rested on Hermione. \"You\\'re another one who might think about a career as an Auror,\" he told her. \"Mind works the right way.\\n\\nGranger.\"\\n\\nHermione flushed pink with pleasure.\\n\\n\"Well, he wasn\\'t invisible,\" said Harry. \"The map shows invisible people. He must\\'ve left the grounds, then.\"\\n\\n\"But under his own steam?\" said Hermione eagerly, \"or because someone made him?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, someone could\\'ve � could\\'ve pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him, couldn\\'t they?\" said Ron quickly, looking hopefully at Moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror.\\n\\n\"We can\\'t rule out kidnap,\" growled Moody.\\n\\n\"So,\" said Ron, \"d\\'you reckon he\\'s somewhere in Hogsmeade?\"\\n\\n\"Could be anywhere,\" said Moody, shaking his head. \"Only thing we know for sure is that he\\'s not here.\"\\n\\nHe yawned widely, so that his scars stretched, and his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth. Then he said, \"Now, Dumbledore\\'s told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators, but there\\'s nothing you can do for Crouch. The Ministry\\'ll be looking for him now, Dumbledore\\'s notified them. Potter, you just keep your mind on the third task.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry. \"Oh yeah . . .\"\\n\\nHe hadn\\'t given the maze a single thought since he\\'d left it with Krum the previous night.\\n\\n\"Should be right up your street, this one,\" said Moody, looking up at Harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin. \"From what Dumbledore\\'s said, you\\'ve managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times. Broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the Sorcerers Stone in your first year, didn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"We helped,\" Ron said quickly. \"Me and Hermione helped.\"\\n\\nMoody grinned.\\n\\n\"Well, help him practice for this one, and I\\'ll be very surprised if he doesn\\'t win,\"\\n\\nsaid Moody. \"In the meantime .. . constant vigilance, Potter. Constant vigilance.\"\\n\\nHe took another long draw from his hip flask, and his magical eye swiveled onto the window. The topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was visible through it.\\n\\n\"You two,\" counseled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and Hermione, \"you stick close to Potter, all right? I\\'m keeping an eye on things, but all the same . . . you can never have too many eyes out.\"\\n\\nSirius sent their owl back the very next morning. It fluttered down beside Harry at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of Hermione, clutching a copy of the Daily Prophet in its beak. She took the newspaper, scanned the first few pages, said, \"Ha! She hasn\\'t got wind of Crouch!\" then joined Ron and Harry in reading what Sirius had to say on the mysterious events of the night before last.\\n\\nHarry � what do you think you are playing at, walking off into the forest with Viktor Krum? I want you to swear, by return owl, that you are not going to go walking with anyone else at night. There is somebody highly dangerous at Hogwarts. It is clear to me that they wanted to stop Crouch from seeing Dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in the dark. You could have been killed.\\n\\nYour name didn\\'t get into the Goblet of Fire by accident. If someone\\'s trying to attack you, they\\'re on their last chance. Stay close to Ron and Hermione, do not leave Gryffindor Tower after hours, and arm yourself for the third task. Practice Stunning and Disarming. A few hexes wouldn\\'t go amiss either. There\\'s nothing you can do about Crouch. Keep your head down and look after yourself. I\\'m waiting for your letter giving me your word you won\\'t stray out�of�bounds again.\\n\\nSirius \"Who\\'s he, to lecture me about being out�of�bounds?\" said Harry in mild indignation as he folded up Sirius\\'s letter and put it inside his robes. \"After all the stuff he did at school!\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s worried about you!\" said Hermione sharply. \"Just like Moody and Hagrid!\\n\\nSo listen to them!\"\\n\\n\"No one\\'s tried to attack me all year,\" said Harry. \"No one\\'s done anything to me at all�\"\\n\\n\"Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire,\" said Hermione. \"And they must\\'ve done that for a reason. Harry. Snuffles is right. Maybe they\\'ve been biding their time. Maybe this is the task they\\'re going to get you.\"\\n\\n\"Look,\" said Harry impatiently, \"let\\'s say Sirius is right, and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch. Well, they would\\'ve been in the trees near us, wouldn\\'t they? But they waited till I was out of the way until they acted, didn\\'t they? So it doesn\\'t look like I\\'m their target, does it?\"\\n\\n\"They couldn\\'t have made it look like an accident if they\\'d murdered you in the forest!\" said Hermione. \"But if you die during a task�\"\\n\\n\"They didn\\'t care about attacking Krum, did they?\" said Harry. \"Why didn\\'t they just polish me off at the same time? They could\\'ve made it look like Krum and I had a duel or something.\"\\n\\n\"Harry, I don\\'t understand it either,\" said Hermione desperately. \"I just know there are a lot of odd things going on, and I don\\'t like it. ... Moody\\'s right � Sirius is right � you\\'ve got to get in training for the third task, straight away. And you make sure you write back to Sirius and promise him you\\'re not going to go sneaking off alone again.\"\\n\\nThe Hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when Harry had to stay indoors. For the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library with Hermione and Ron, looking up hexes, or else in empty classrooms, which they sneaked into to practice. Harry was concentrating on the Stunning Spell, which he had never used before. The trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on Ron\\'s and Hermione\\'s part.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t we kidnap Mrs. Norris?\" Ron suggested on Monday lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the middle of their Charms classroom, having just been Stunned and reawoken by Harry for the fifth time in a row. \"Let\\'s Stun her for a bit. Or you could use Dobby, Harry, I bet he\\'d do anything to help you. I\\'m not complaining or anything\" � he got gingerly to his feet, rubbing his backside � \"but I\\'m aching all over. ...\"\\n\\n\"Well, you keep missing the cushions, don\\'t you!\" said Hermione impatiently, rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for the Banishing Spell, which Flitwick had left in a cabinet. \"Just try and fall backward!\"\\n\\n\"Once you\\'re Stunned, you can\\'t aim too well, Hermione! \"said Ron angrily. \"Why don\\'t you take a turn?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I think Harry\\'s got it now, anyway,\" said Hermione hastily. \"And we don\\'t\\n\\nhave to worry about Disarming, because he\\'s been able to do that for ages. ... I think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening.\"\\n\\nShe looked down the list they had made in the library.\\n\\n\"I like the look of this one,\" she said, \"this Impediment Curse. Should slow down anything that\\'s trying to attack you. Harry. We\\'ll start with that one.\"\\n\\nThe bell rang. They hastily shoved the cushions back into Flitwicks cupboard and slipped out of the classroom.\\n\\n\"See you at dinner!\" said Hermione, and she set off for Arithmancy, while Harry and Ron headed toward North Tower, and Divination. Broad strips of dazzling gold sunlight tell across the corridor from the high windows. The sky outside was so brightly blue it looked as though it had been enameled.\\n\\n\"It\\'s going to be boiling in Trelawney\\'s room, she never puts out that fire,\" said Ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoor.\\n\\nHe was quite right. The dimly lit room was swelteringly hot. The fumes from the perfumed fire were heavier than ever. Harrys head swam as he made his way over to one of the curtained windows. While Professor Trelawney was looking the other way, disentangling her shawl from a lamp, he opened it an inch or so and settled back in his chintz armchair, so that a soft breeze played across his face. It was extremely comfortable.\\n\\n\"My dears,\" said Professor Trelawney, sitting down in her winged armchair in front of the class and peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes, \"we have almost finished our work on planetary divination. Today, however, will be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of Mars, for he is placed most interestingly at the present time. If you will all look this way, I will dim the lights.\\n\\n. . .\"\\n\\nShe waved her wand and the lamps went out. The fire was the only source of light now. Professor Trelawney bent down and lifted, from under her chair, a miniature model of the solar system, contained within a glass dome. It was a beautiful thing; each of the moons glimmered in place around the nine planets and the fiery sun, all of them hanging in thin air beneath the glass. Harry watched lazily as Professor Trelawney began to point out the fascinating angle Mars was making to Neptune.\\n\\nThe heavily perfumed fumes washed over him, and the breeze from the window played across his face. He could hear an insect humming gently somewhere behind the curtain. His eyelids began to droop. . . .\\n\\nHe was riding on the back of an eagle owl, soaring through the clear blue sky toward an old, ivy�covered house set high on a hillside. Lower and lower they flew, the wind blowing pleasantly in Harry\\'s face, until they reached a dark and broken window in the upper story of the house and entered. Now they were flying along a gloomy passageway, to a room at the very end . . . through the door they went, into a dark room whose windows were boarded up....\\n\\nHarry had left the owl\\'s back... he was watching, now, as it fluttered across the room, into a chair with its back to him. . . . There were two dark shapes on the floor beside the chair . . . both of them were stirring. . . .\\n\\nOne was a huge snake . . . the other was a man ... a short, balding man, a man with watery eyes and a pointed nose ... he was wheezing and sobbing on the hearth rug.\\n\\n. . .\\n\\n\"You are in luck, Wormtail,\" said a cold, high�pitched voice from the depths of the chair in which the owl had landed. \"You are very fortunate indeed. Your blunder has not ruined everything. He is dead.\"\\n\\n\"My Lord!\" gasped the man on the floor. \"My Lord, I am ... I am so pleased . . .\\n\\nand so sorry. ...\"\\n\\n\"Nagini,\" said the cold voice, \"you are out of luck. I will not be feeding Wormtail to you, after all... but never mind, never mind . . . there is still Harry Potter. ...\"\\n\\nThe snake hissed. Harry could see its tongue fluttering.\\n\\n\"Now, Wormtail,\" said the cold voice, \"perhaps one more little reminder why I will not tolerate another blunder from you. ...\"\\n\\n\"My Lord ... no ... I beg you . . .\"\\n\\nThe tip of a wand emerged from around the back of the chair. It was pointing at Wormtail.\\n\\n\"Crucio!\" said the cold voice.\\n\\nWormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve in his body were on fire, the screaming filled Harry\\'s ears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain; he was yelling too...Voldemort would hear him, would know he was there. . . .\\n\\n\"Harry! Harry!\"\\n\\nHarry opened his eyes. He was lying on the floor of Professor Trelawney\\'s room with his hands over his face. His scar was still burning so badly that his eyes were watering. The pain had been real. The whole class was standing around him, and Ron was kneeling next to him, looking terrified.\\n\\n\"You all right?\" he said.\\n\\n\"Of course he isn\\'t!\" said Professor Trelawney, looking thoroughly excited. Her great eyes loomed over Harry, gazing at him. \"What was it. Potter? A premonition? An apparition? What did you see?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" Harry lied. He sat up. He could feel himself shaking. He couldn\\'t stop himself from looking around, into the shadows behind him; Voldemorts voice had sounded so close. . . .\\n\\n\"You were clutching your scar!\" said Professor Trelawney. \"You were rolling on the floor, clutching your scar! Come now. Potter, I have experience in these matters!\"\\n\\nHarry looked up at her.\\n\\n\"I need to go to the hospital wing, I think,\" he said. \"Bad headache.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room!\" said Professor Trelawney. \"If you leave now, you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever �\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to see anything except a headache cure,\" said Harry.\\n\\nHe stood up. The class backed away. They all looked unnerved.\\n\\n\"See you later,\" Harry muttered to Ron, and he picked up his bag and headed for the trapdoor, ignoring Professor Trelawney, who was wearing an expression of great frustration, as though she had just been denied a real treat.\\n\\nWhen Harry reached the bottom of her stepladder, however, he did not set off for the hospital wing. He had no intention whatsoever of going there. Sirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again, and Harry was going to follow his advice: He was going straight to Dumbledore\\'s office. He marched down the corridors, thinking about what he had seen in the dream . . . it had been as vivid as the one that had awoken him on Privet Drive. . . . He ran over the details in his mind, trying to make sure he could remember them. . . . He had heard Voldemort accusing Wormtail of making a blunder . . . but the owl had brought good news, the blunder had been repaired, somebody was dead ... so Wormtail was not going to be fed to the snake . . . he, Harry, was going to be fed to it instead. . . .\\n\\nHarry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledores office without noticing. He blinked, looked around, realized what he had done, and retraced his steps, stopping in front of it. Then he remembered that he didn\\'t know the password.\\n\\n\"Sherbet lemon?\" he tried tentatively.\\n\\nThe gargoyle did not move.\\n\\n\"Okay,\" said Harry, staring at it, \"Pear Drop. Er � Licorice Wand. Fizzing Whizbee. Drooble\\'s Best Blowing Gum. Bertie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans ... oh no, he doesn\\'t like them, does he?... oh just open, can\\'t you?\" he said angrily. \"I really need to see him, its urgent!\"\\n\\nThe gargoyle remained immovable.\\n\\nHarry kicked it, achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in his big toe.\\n\\n\"Chocolate Frog!\" he yelled angrily, standing on one leg. \"Sugar Quill! Cockroach\\n\\nCluster!\"\\n\\nThe gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside. Harry blinked.\\n\\n\"Cockroach Cluster?\" he said, amazed. \"I was only joking. ...\"\\n\\nHe hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped onto the foot of a spiral stone staircase, which moved slowly upward as the doors closed behind him, taking him up to a polished oak door with a brass door knocker.\\n\\nHe could hear voices from inside the office. He stepped off the moving staircase and hesitated, listening.\\n\\n\"Dumbledore, I\\'m afraid I don\\'t see the connection, don\\'t see it at all!\" It was the voice of the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. \"Ludo says Berthas perfectly capable of getting herself lost. I agree we would have expected to have found her by now, but all the same, we\\'ve no evidence of foul play, Dumbledore, none at all.\\n\\nAs for her disappearance being linked with Barty Crouch\\'s!\"\\n\\n\"And what do you thinks happened to Barty Crouch, Minister?\" said Moody\\'s growling voice.\\n\\n\"I see two possibilities, Alastor,\" said Fudge. \"Either Crouch has finally cracked � more than likely, I\\'m sure you\\'ll agree, given his personal history � lost his mind, and gone wandering off somewhere �\"\\n\\n\"He wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case, Cornelius,\" said Dumbledore calmly.\\n\\n\"Or else � well...\" Fudge sounded embarrassed. \"Well, I\\'ll reserve judgment until after I\\'ve seen the place where he was found, but you say it was just past the Beauxbatons carriage? Dumbledore, you know what that woman is?\"\\n\\n\"I consider her to be a very able headmistress � and an excellent dancer,\" said Dumbledore quietly.\\n\\n\"Dumbledore, come!\" said Fudge angrily. \"Don\\'t you think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of Hagrid? They don\\'t all turn out harmless � if, indeed, you can call Hagrid harmless, with that monster fixation he\\'s got �\"\\n\\n\"I no more suspect Madame Maxime than Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, just as calmly. \"I think it possible that it is you who are prejudiced, Cornelius.\"\\n\\n\"Can we wrap up this discussion?\" growled Moody.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, let\\'s go down to the grounds, then,\" said Fudge impatiently.\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s not that,\" said Moody, \"it\\'s just that Potter wants a word with you, Dumbledore. He\\'s just outside the door.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY � THE PENSIEVE\\n\\nThe door of the office opened.\\n\\n\"Hello, Potter,\" said Moody. \"Come in, then.\"\\n\\nHarry walked inside. He had been inside Dumbledore\\'s office once before; it was a very beautiful, circular room, lined with pictures of previous headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts, all of whom were fast asleep, their chests rising and falling gently.\\n\\nCornelius Fudge was standing beside Dumbledore\\'s desk, wearing his usual pinstriped cloak and holding his lime�green bowler hat.\\n\\n\"Harry!\" said Fudge jovially, moving forward. \"How are you?\"\\n\\n\"Fine,\" Harry lied.\\n\\n\"We were just talking about the night when Mr. Crouch turned up on the grounds,\"\\n\\nsaid Fudge. \"It was you who found him, was it not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. Then, feeling it was pointless to pretend that he hadn\\'t overheard what they had been saying, he added, \"I didn\\'t see Madame Maxime anywhere, though, and she\\'d have a job hiding, wouldn\\'t she?\"\\n\\nDumbledore smiled at Harry behind Fudge\\'s back, his eyes twinkling.\\n\\n\"Yes, well,\" said Fudge, looking embarrassed, \"we\\'re about to go for a short walk on the grounds, Harry, if you\\'ll excuse us ... perhaps if you just go back to your class �\"\\n\\n\"I wanted to talk to you. Professor,\" Harry said quickly, looking at Dumbledore, who gave him a swift, searching look.\\n\\n\"Wait here for me, Harry,\" he said. \"Our examination of the grounds will not take long.\"\\n\\nThey trooped out in silence past him and closed the door. After a minute or so, Harry heard the clunks of Moody\\'s wooden leg growing fainter in the corridor below. He looked around.\\n\\n\"Hello, Fawkes,\" he said.\\n\\nFawkes, Professor Dumbledore\\'s phoenix, was standing on his golden perch beside the door. The size of a swan, with magnificent scarlet�and�gold plumage, he swished his long tail and blinked benignly at Harry.\\n\\nHarry sat down in a chair in front of Dumbledore\\'s desk. For several minutes, he\\n\\nsat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their frames, thinking about what he had just heard, and running his fingers over his scar. It had stopped hurting now.\\n\\nHe felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in Dumbledore\\'s office, knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at the walls behind the desk. The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing on a shelf. A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged to Godric Gryffindor, founder of Harry\\'s House. He was gazing at it, remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the glass case. He looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of silver�white shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him, whose door had not been closed properly. Harry hesitated, glanced at Fawkes, then got up, walked across the office, and pulled open the cabinet door.\\n\\nA shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the edge: runes and symbols that Harry did not recognize. The silvery light was coming from the basin\\'s contents, which were like nothing Harry had ever seen before. He could not tell whether the substance was liquid or gas. It was a bright, whitish silver, and it was moving ceaselessly; the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind, and then, like clouds, separated and swirled smoothly. It looked like light made liquid � or like wind made solid � Harry couldn\\'t make up his mind.\\n\\nHe wanted to touch it, to find out what it felt like, but nearly four years\\' experience of the magical world told him that sticking his hand into a bowl full of some unknown substance was a very stupid thing to do. He therefore pulled his wand out of the inside of his robes, cast a nervous look around the office, looked back at the contents of the basin, and prodded them.\\n\\nThe surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl very fast.\\n\\nHarry bent closer, his head right inside the cabinet. The silvery substance had become transparent; it looked like glass. He looked down into it expecting to see the stone bottom of the basin � and saw instead an enormous room below the surface of the mysterious substance, a room into which he seemed to be looking through a circular window in the ceiling.\\n\\nThe room was dimly lit; he thought it might even be underground, for there were no windows, merely torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated the walls of Hogwarts. Lowering his face so that his nose was a mere inch away from the glassy substance, Harry saw that rows and rows of witches and wizards were seated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in levels. An empty chair stood in the very center of the room. There was something about the chair that gave Harry an ominous feeling. Chains encircled the arms of it, as though its occupants were usually tied to it.\\n\\nWhere was this place? It surely wasn\\'t Hogwarts; he had never seen a room like that here in the castle. Moreover, the crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom of the basin was comprised of adults, and Harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at Hogwarts. They seemed, he thought, to be waiting for something; even though he could only see the tops of their hats, all of their faces seemed to be pointing in one direction, and none of them were talking to one another.\\n\\nThe basin being circular, and the room he was observing square, Harry could not make out what was going on in the corners of it. He leaned even closer, tilting his head, trying to see...\\n\\nThe tip of his nose touched the strange substance into which he was staring.\\n\\nDumbledore\\'s office gave an almighty lurch � Harry was thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin � But his head did not hit the stone bottom. He was falling through something icy� cold and black; it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool � And suddenly, Harry found himself sitting on a bench at the end of the room inside the basin, a bench raised high above the others. He looked up at the high stone ceiling, expecting to see the circular window through which he had just been staring, but there was nothing there but dark, solid stone.\\n\\nBreathing hard and fast. Harry looked around him. Not one of the witches and wizards in the room (and there were at least two hundred of them) was looking at him. Not one of them seemed to have noticed that a fourteen�year�old boy had just dropped from the ceiling into their midst. Harry turned to the wizard next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that reverberated around the silent room.\\n\\nHe was sitting right next to Albus Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"Professor!\" Harry said in a kind of strangled whisper. \"I\\'m sorry � I didn\\'t mean to � I was just looking at that basin in your cabinet � I � where are we?\"\\n\\nBut Dumbledore didn\\'t move or speak. He ignored Harry completely. Like every other wizard on the benches, he was staring into the far corner of the room, where there was a door.\\n\\nHarry gazed, nonplussed, at Dumbledore, then around at the silently watchful crowd, then back at Dumbledore. And then it dawned on him. . . .\\n\\nOnce before. Harry had found himself somewhere that nobody could see or hear him. That time, he had fallen through a page in an enchanted diary, right into somebody else\\'s memory . . . and unless he was very much mistaken, something of the sort had happened again...\\n\\nHarry raised his right hand, hesitated, and then waved it energetically in from of\\n\\nDumbledore\\'s face. Dumbledore did not blink, look around at Harry, or indeed move at all. And that, in Harry\\'s opinion, settled the matter. Dumbledore wouldn\\'t ignore him like that. He was inside a memory, and this was not the present�day Dumbledore. Yet it couldn\\'t be that long ago . . . the Dumbledore sitting next to him now was silver�haired, just like the present�day Dumbledore. But what was this place? What were all these wizards waiting for!\\n\\nHarry looked around more carefully. The room, as he had suspected when observing it from above, was almost certainly underground � more of a dungeon than a room, he thought. There was a bleak and forbidding air about the place; there were no pictures on the walls, no decorations at all; just these serried rows of benches, rising in levels all around the room, all positioned so that they had a clear view of that chair with the chains on its arms.\\n\\nBefore Harry could reach any conclusions about the place in which they were, he heard footsteps. The door in the corner of the dungeon opened and three people entered � or at least one man, flanked by two dementors.\\n\\nHarry\\'s insides went cold. The dementors � tall, hooded creatures whose faces were concealed � were gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the room, each grasping one of the man\\'s arms with their dead and rotten�looking hands. The man between them looked as though he was about to faint, and Harry couldn\\'t blame him ... he knew the dementors could not touch him inside a memory, but he remembered their power only too well. The watching crowd recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the man in the chained chair and glided back out of the room. The door swung shut behind them.\\n\\nHarry looked down at the man now sitting in the chair and saw that it was Karkaroff.\\n\\nUnlike Dumbledore, Karkaroff looked much younger; his hair and goatee were black. He was not dressed in sleek furs, but in thin and ragged robes. He was shaking. Even as Harry watched, the chains on the arms of the chair glowed suddenly gold and snaked their way up Karkaroff\\'s arms, binding him there.\\n\\n\"Igor Karkaroff,\" said a curt voice to Harry\\'s left. Harry looked around and saw Mr. Crouch standing up in the middle of the bench beside him. Crouch\\'s hair was dark, his face was much less lined, he looked fit and alert. \"You have been brought from Azkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic. You have given us to understand that you have important information for us.\"\\n\\nKarkaroff straightened himself as best he could, tightly bound to the chair.\\n\\n\"I have, sir,\" he said, and although his voice was very scared, Harry could still hear the familiar unctuous note in it. \"I wish to be of use to the Ministry. I wish to help. I � I know that the Ministry is trying to � to round up the last of the Dark Lords supporters. I am eager to assist in any way I can. ...\"\\n\\nThere was a murmur around the benches. Some of the wizards and witches were\\n\\nsurveying Karkaroff with interest, others with pronounced mistrust. Then Harry heard, quite distinctly, from Dumbledores other side, a familiar, growling voice saying, \"Filth.\"\\n\\nHarry leaned forward so that he could see past Dumbledore. Mad�Eye Moody was sitting there � except that there was a very noticeable difference in his appearance.\\n\\nHe did not have his magical eye, but two normal ones. Both were looking down upon Karkaroff, and both were narrowed in intense dislike.\\n\\n\"Crouch is going to let him out,\" Moody breathed quietly to Dumbledore. \"He\\'s done a deal with him. Took me six months to track him down, and Crouch is going to let him go if he\\'s got enough new names. Let\\'s hear his information, I say, and throw him straight back to the dementors.\"\\n\\nDumbledore made a small noise of dissent through his long, crooked nose.\\n\\n\"Ah, I was forgetting . . . you don\\'t like the dementors, do you, Albus?\" said Moody with a sardonic smile.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Dumbledore calmly, \"I\\'m afraid I don\\'t. I have long felt the Ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures.\"\\n\\n\"But for filth like this . . .\" Moody said softly.\\n\\n\"You say you have names for us, Karkaroff,\" said Mr. Crouch. \"Let us hear them, please.\"\\n\\n\"You must understand,\" said Karkaroff hurriedly, \"that He�Who�Must�Not�Be� Named operated always in the greatest secrecy. . . . He preferred that we � I mean to say, his supporters � and I regret now, very deeply, that I ever counted myself among them �\"\\n\\n\"Get on with it,\" sneered Moody.\\n\\n\"� we never knew the names of every one of our fellows � He alone knew exactly who we all were �\"\\n\\n\"Which was a wise move, wasn\\'t it, as it prevented someone like you, Karkaroff, from turning all of them in,\" muttered Moody.\\n\\n\"Yet you say you have some names for us?\" said Mr. Crouch.\\n\\n\"I � I do,\" said Karkaroff breathlessly. \"And these were important supporters, mark you. People I saw with my own eyes doing his bidding. I give this information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce him, and am filled with a remorse so deep I can barely �\"\\n\\n\"These names are?\" said Mr. Crouch sharply.\\n\\nKarkaroff drew a deep breath.\\n\\n\"There was Antonin Dolohov,\" he said. \"I � I saw him torture countless Muggles and � and non�supporters of the Dark Lord.\"\\n\\n\"And helped him do it,\" murmured Moody.\\n\\n\"We have already apprehended Dolohov,\" said Crouch. \"He was caught shortly after yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed?\" said Karkaroff, his eyes widening. \"I � I am delighted to hear it!\"\\n\\nBut he didn\\'t look it. Harry could tell that this news had come as a real blow to him. One of his names was worthless.\\n\\n\"Any others?\" said Crouch coldly.\\n\\n\"Why, yes ... there was Rosier,\" said Karkaroff hurriedly. \"Evan Rosier.\"\\n\\n\"Rosier is dead,\" said Crouch. \"He was caught shortly after you were too. He preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggle.\"\\n\\n\"Took a bit of me with him, though,\" whispered Moody to Harry\\'s right. Harry looked around at him once more, and saw him indicating the large chunk out of his nose to Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"No � no more than Rosier deserved!\" said Karkaroff, a real note of panic in his voice now. Harry could see that he was starting to worry that none of his information would be of any use to the Ministry. Karkaroff\\'s eyes darted toward the door in the corner, behind which the dementors undoubtedly still stood, waiting.\\n\\n\"Any more?\" said Crouch.\\n\\n\"Yes!\" said Karkaroff. \"There was Travers � he helped murder the McKinnons!\\n\\nMulciber � he specialized in the Imperius Curse, forced countless people to do horrific things! Rookwood, who was a spy, and passed He�Who�Must�Not�Be� Named useful information from inside the Ministry itself!\"\\n\\nHarry could tell that, this time, Karkaroff had struck gold. The watching crowd was all murmuring together.\\n\\n\"Rookwood?\" said Mr. Crouch, nodding to a witch sitting in front of him, who began scribbling upon her piece of parchment. \"Augustus Rookwood of the Department of Mysteries?\"\\n\\n\"The very same,\" said Karkaroff eagerly. \"I believe he used a network of well� placed wizards, both inside the Ministry and out, to collect information �\"\\n\\n\"But Travers and Mulciber we have,\" said Mr. Crouch. \"Very well, Karkaroff, if that is all, you will be returned to Azkaban while we decide �\"\\n\\n\"Not yet!\" cried Karkaroff, looking quite desperate. \"Wait, I have more!\"\\n\\nHarry could see him sweating in the torchlight, his white skin contrasting strongly with the black of his hair and beard.\\n\\n\"Snape!\" he shouted. \"Severus Snape!\"\\n\\n\"Snape has been cleared by this council,\" said Crouch disdainfully. \"He has been vouched for by Albus Dumbledore.\"\\n\\n\"No!\" shouted Karkaroff, straining at the chains that bound him to the chair. \"I assure you! Severus Snape is a Death Eater!\"\\n\\nDumbledore had gotten to his feet.\\n\\n\"I have given evidence already on this matter,\" he said calmly. \"Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater. However, he rejoined our side before Lord Voldemort\\'s downfall and turned spy for us, at great personal risk. He is now no more a Death Eater than I am.\"\\n\\nHarry turned to look at Mad�Eye Moody. He was wearing a look of deep skepticism behind Dumbledore\\'s back.\\n\\n\"Very well, Karkaroff,\" Crouch said coldly, \"you have been of assistance. I shall review your case. You will return to Azkaban in the meantime. ...\"\\n\\nMr. Crouch\\'s voice faded. Harry looked around; the dungeon was dissolving as though it were made of smoke; everything was fading; he could see only his own body � all else was swirling darkness. . . .\\n\\nAnd then, the dungeon returned. Harry was sitting in a different seat, still on the highest bench, but now to the left side of Mr. Crouch. The atmosphere seemed quite different: relaxed, even cheerful. The witches and wizards all around the walls were talking to one another, almost as though they were at some sort of sporting event. Harry noticed a witch halfway up the rows of benches opposite.\\n\\nShe had short blonde hair, was wearing magenta robes, and was sucking the end of an acid�green quill. It was, unmistakably, a younger Rita Skeeter. Harry looked around; Dumbledore was sitting beside him again, wearing different robes. Mr.\\n\\nCrouch looked more tired and somehow fiercer, gaunter. . . . Harry understood. It was a different memory, a different day ... a different trial.\\n\\nThe door in the corner opened, and Ludo Bagman walked into the room.\\n\\nThis was not, however, a Ludo Bagman gone to seed, but a Ludo Bagman who was clearly at the height of his Quidditch�playing fitness. His nose wasn\\'t broken now; he was tall and lean and muscular. Bagman looked nervous as he sat down in the chained chair, but it did not bind him there as it had bound Karkaroff, and Bagman, perhaps taking heart from this, glanced around at the watching crowd, waved at a couple of them, and managed a small smile.\\n\\n\"Ludo Bagman, you have been brought here in front of the Council of Magical Law to answer charges relating to the activities of the Death Eaters,\" said Mr.\\n\\nCrouch. \"We have heard the evidence against you, and are about to reach our verdict. Do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce judgment?\"\\n\\nHarry couldn\\'t believe his ears. Ludo Bagman, a Death Eater!\\n\\n\"Only,\" said Bagman, smiling awkwardly, \"well � I know I\\'ve been a bit of an idiot �\"\\n\\nOne or two wizards and witches in the surrounding seats smiled indulgently. Mr.\\n\\nCrouch did not appear to share their feelings. He was staring down at Ludo Bagman with an expression of the utmost severity and dislike.\\n\\n\"You never spoke a truer word, boy,\" someone muttered dryly to Dumbledore behind Harry. He looked around and saw Moody sitting there again. \"If I didn\\'t know he\\'d always been dim, I\\'d have said some of those Bludgers had permanently affected his brain. ...\"\\n\\n\"Ludovic Bagman, you were caught passing information to Lord Voldemort\\'s supporters,\" said Mr. Crouch. \"For this, I suggest a term of imprisonment in Azkaban lasting no less than �\"\\n\\nBut there was an angry outcry from the surrounding benches. Several of the witches and wizards around the walls stood up, shaking their heads, and even their fists, at Mr. Crouch.\\n\\n\"But I\\'ve told you, I had no idea!\" Bagman called earnestly over the crowd\\'s babble, his round blue eyes widening. \"None at all! Old Rookwood was a friend of my dad\\'s . . . never crossed my mind he was in with You�Know�Who! I thought I was collecting information for our side! And Rookwood kept talking about getting me a job in the Ministry later on ... once my Quidditch days are over, you know ...\\n\\nI mean, I can\\'t keep getting hit by Bludgers for the rest of my life, can I?\"\\n\\nThere were titters from the crowd.\\n\\n\"It will be put to the vote,\" said Mr. Crouch coldly. He turned to the right�hand side of the dungeon. \"The jury will please raise their hands . . . those in favor of imprisonment...\"\\n\\nHarry looked toward the right�hand side of the dungeon. Not one person raised their hand. Many of the witches and wizards around the walls began to clap. One of the witches on the jury stood up.\\n\\n\"Yes?\" barked Crouch.\\n\\n\"We\\'d just like to congratulate Mr. Bagman on his splendid performance for England in the Quidditch match against Turkey last Saturday,\" the witch said breathlessly.\\n\\nMr. Crouch looked furious. The dungeon was ringing with applause now. Bagman\\n\\ngot to his feet and bowed, beaming.\\n\\n\"Despicable,\" Mr. Crouch spat at Dumbledore, sitting down as Bagman walked out of the dungeon. \"Rookwood get him a job indeed. . . . The day Ludo Bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the Ministry. . . .\"\\n\\nAnd the dungeon dissolved again. When it had returned, Harry looked around. He and Dumbledore were still sitting beside Mr. Crouch, but the atmosphere could not have been more different. There was total silence, broken only by the dry sobs of a frail, wispy�looking witch in the seat next to Mr. Crouch. She was clutching a handkerchief to her mouth with trembling hands.\\n\\nHarry looked up at Crouch and saw that he looked gaunter and grayer than ever before. A nerve was twitching in his temple.\\n\\n\"Bring them in,\" he said, and his voice echoed through the silent dungeon.\\n\\nThe door in the corner opened yet again. Six dementors entered this time, flanking a group of four people. Harry saw the people in the crowd turn to look up at Mr.\\n\\nCrouch. A few of them whispered to one another.\\n\\nThe dementors placed each of the four people in the four chairs with chained arms that now stood on the dungeon floor. There was a thickset man who stared blankly up at Crouch; a thinner and more nervous�looking man, whose eyes were darting around the crowd; a woman with thick, shining dark hair and heavily hooded eyes, who was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a throne; and a boy in his late teens, who looked nothing short of petrified. He was shivering, his straw� colored hair all over his face, his freckled skin milk�white. The wispy little witch beside Crouch began to rock backward and forward in her seat, whimpering into her handkerchief.\\n\\nCrouch stood up. He looked down upon the four in front of him, and there was pure hatred in his face.\\n\\n\"You have been brought here before the Council of Magical Law,\" he said clearly, \"so that we may pass judgment on you, for a crime so heinous �\"\\n\\n\"Father,\" said the boy with the straw�colored hair. \"Father. . .please . . .\\n\\n\"� that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court,\" said Crouch, speaking more loudly, drowning out his son\\'s voice.\\n\\n\"We have heard the evidence against you. The four of you stand accused of capturing an Auror � Frank Longbottom � and subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse, believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master, He�Who�Must�Not�Be�Named �\"\\n\\n\"Father, I didn\\'t!\" shrieked the boy in chains below. \"I didn\\'t, I swear it. Father, don\\'t send me back to the dementors �\"\\n\\n\"You are further accused,\" bellowed Mr. Crouch, \"of using the Cruciatus Curse on Frank Longbottom\\'s wife, when he would not give you information. You planned to restore He�Who�Must�Not�Be�Named to power, and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong. I now ask the jury �\"\\n\\n\"Mother!\" screamed the boy below, and the wispy little witch beside Crouch began to sob, rocking backward and forward. \"Mother, stop him. Mother, I didn\\'t do it, it wasn\\'t me!\"\\n\\n\"I now ask the jury,\" shouted Mr. Crouch, \"to raise their hands if they believe, as I do, that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban!\"\\n\\nIn unison, the witches and wizards along the right�hand side of the dungeon raised their hands. The crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for Bagman, their faces full of savage triumph. The boy began to scream.\\n\\n\"No! Mother, no! I didn\\'t do it, I didn\\'t do it, I didn\\'t know! Don\\'t send me there, don\\'t let him!\"\\n\\nThe dementors were gliding back into the room. The boys\\' three companions rose quietly from their seats; the woman with the heavy�lidded eyes looked up at Crouch and called, \"The Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch! Throw us into Azkaban; we will wait! He will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters! We alone were faithful! We alone tried to find him!\"\\n\\nBut the boy was trying to fight off the dementors, even though Harry could see their cold, draining power starting to affect him. The crowd was jeering, some of them on their feet, as the woman swept out of the dungeon, and the boy continued to struggle.\\n\\n\"I\\'m your son!\" he screamed up at Crouch. \"I\\'m your son!\"\\n\\n\"You are no son of mine!\" bellowed Mr. Crouch, his eyes bulging suddenly. \"I have no son!\"\\n\\nThe wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp and slumped in her seat. She had fainted. Crouch appeared not to have noticed.\\n\\n\"Take them away!\" Crouch roared at the dementors, spit flying from his mouth.\\n\\n\"Take them away, and may they rot there!\"\\n\\n\"Father! Father, I wasn\\'t involved! No! No! Father, please!\"\\n\\n\"I think. Harry, it is time to return to my office,\" said a quiet voice in Harrys ear.\\n\\nHarry started. He looked around. Then he looked on his other side.\\n\\nThere was an Albus Dumbledore sitting on his right, watching Crouch\\'s son being dragged away by the dementors � and there was an Albus Dumbledore on his left,\\n\\nlooking right at him.\\n\\n\"Come,\" said the Dumbledore on his left, and he put his hand under Harrys elbow.\\n\\nHarry felt himself rising into the air; the dungeon dissolved around him; for a moment, all was blackness, and then he felt as though he had done a slow�motion somersault, suddenly landing flat on his feet, in what seemed like the dazzling light of Dumbledore\\'s sunlit office. The stone basin was shimmering in the cabinet in front of him, and Albus Dumbledore was standing beside him.\\n\\n\"Professor,\" Harry gasped, \"I know I shouldn\\'t\\'ve � I didn\\'t mean � the cabinet door was sort of open and �\"\\n\\n\"I quite understand,\" said Dumbledore. He lifted the basin, carried it over to his desk, placed it upon the polished top, and sat down in the chair behind it. He motioned for Harry to sit down opposite him.\\n\\nHarry did so, staring at the stone basin. The contents had returned to their original, silvery�white state, swirling and rippling beneath his gaze.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" Harry asked shakily.\\n\\n\"This? It is called a Pensieve,\" said Dumbledore. \"I sometimes find, and I am sure you know the feeling, that I simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind.\"\\n\\n\"Er,\" said Harry, who couldn\\'t truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of the sort.\\n\\n\"At these times,\" said Dumbledore, indicating the stone basin, \"I use the Pensieve.\\n\\nOne simply siphons the excess thoughts from one\\'s mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one\\'s leisure. It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.\"\\n\\n\"You mean . . . that stuff\\'s your thoughts?\" Harry said, staring at the swirling white substance in the basin.\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said Dumbledore. \"Let me show you.\"\\n\\nDumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip into his own silvery hair, near his temple. When he took the wand away, hair seemed to be clinging to it � but then Harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange silvery�white substance that filled the Pensieve. Dumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin, and Harry, astonished, saw his own face swimming around the surface of the bowl. Dumbledore placed his long hands on either side of the Pensieve and swirled it, rather as a gold prospector would pan for fragments of gold.... and Harry saw his own face change smoothly into Snape\\'s, who opened his mouth and spoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly.\\n\\n\"It\\'s coming back . . . Karkaroff\\'s too . . . stronger and clearer than ever...\"\\n\\n\"A connection I could have made without assistance,\" Dumbledore sighed, \"but never mind.\" He peered over the top of his half�moon spectacles at Harry, who was gaping at Snape\\'s face, which was continuing to swirl around the bowl. \"I was using the Pensieve when Mr. Fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather hastily. Undoubtedly I did not fasten the cabinet door properly. Naturally, it would have attracted your attention.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" Harry mumbled.\\n\\nDumbledore shook his head. \"Curiosity is not a sin,\" he said. \"But we should exercise caution with our curiosity. . . yes, indeed ...\"\\n\\nFrowning slightly, he prodded the thoughts within the basin with the tip of his wand. Instantly, a figure rose out of it, a plump, scowling girl of about sixteen, who began to revolve slowly, with her feet still in the basin. She took no notice whatsoever of Harry or Professor Dumbledore. When she spoke, her voice echoed as Snape\\'s had done, as though it were coming from the depths of the stone basin.\\n\\n\"He put a hex on me, Professor Dumbledore, and I was only teasing him, sir, I only said I\\'d seen him kissing Florence behind the greenhouses last Thursday. . . .\"\\n\\n\"But why. Bertha,\" said Dumbledore sadly, looking up at the now silently revolving girl, \"why did you have to follow him in the first place?\"\\n\\n\"Bertha?\" Harry whispered, looking up at her. \"Is that � was that Bertha Jorkins?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore, prodding the thoughts in the basin again; Bertha sank back into them, and they became silvery and opaque once more. \"That was Bertha as I remember her at school.\"\\n\\nThe silvery light from the Pensieve illuminated Dumbledore\\'s face, and it struck Harry suddenly how very old he was looking. He knew, of course, that Dumbledore was getting on in years, but somehow he never really thought of Dumbledore as an old man.\\n\\n\"So, Harry,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Before you got lost in my thoughts, you wanted to tell me something.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"Professor � I was in Divination just now, and � er � I fell asleep.\"\\n\\nHe hesitated here, wondering if a reprimand was coming, but Dumbledore merely said, \"Quite understandable. Continue.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I had a dream,\" said Harry. \"A dream about Lord Voldemort. He was torturing Wormtail . . . you know who Wormtail�\"\\n\\n\"I do know,\" said Dumbledore promptly. \"Please continue.\"\\n\\n\"Voldemort got a letter from an owl. He said something like, Wormtail\\'s blunder had been repaired. He said someone was dead. Then he said, Wormtail wouldn\\'t be fed to the snake � there was a snake beside his chair. He said � he said he\\'d be feeding me to it, instead. Then he did the Cruciatus Curse on Wormtail � and my scar hurt,\" Harry said. \"It woke me up, it hurt so badly.\"\\n\\nDumbledore merely looked at him.\\n\\n\"Er � that\\'s all,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"I see,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"I see. Now, has your scar hurt at any other time this year, excepting the time it woke you up over the summer?\"\\n\\n\"No, I � how did you know it woke me up over the summer?\" said Harry, astonished.\\n\\n\"You are not Sirius\\'s only correspondent,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have also been in contact with him ever since he left Hogwarts last year. It was I who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay.\"\\n\\nDumbledore got up and began walking up and down behind his desk. Every now and then, he placed his wand tip to his temple, removed another shining silver thought, and added it to the Pensieve. The thoughts inside began to swirl so fast that Harry couldn\\'t make out anything clearly: It was merely a blur of color.\\n\\n\"Professor?\" he said quietly, after a couple of minutes.\\n\\nDumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry.\\n\\n\"My apologies,\" he said quietly. He sat back down at his desk.\\n\\n\"D\\'you � d\\'you know why my scar\\'s hurting me?\"\\n\\nDumbledore looked very intently at Harry for a moment, and then said, \"I have a theory, no more than that. ... It is my belief that your scar hurts both when Lord Voldemort is near you, and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred.\"\\n\\n\"But. . . why?\"\\n\\n\"Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed,\" said Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"That is no ordinary scar.\"\\n\\n\"So you think . . . that dream . . . did it really happen?\"\\n\\n\"It is possible,\" said Dumbledore. \"I would say � probable. Harry � did you see Voldemort?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"Just the back of his chair. But � there wouldn\\'t have been\\n\\nanything to see, would there? I mean, he hasn\\'t got a body, has he? But. . . but then how could he have held the wand?\" Harry said slowly.\\n\\n\"How indeed?\" muttered Dumbledore. \"How indeed . . .\"\\n\\nNeither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke for a while. Dumbledore was gazing across the room, and, every now and then, placing his wand tip to his temple and adding another shining silver thought to the seething mass within the Pensieve.\\n\\n\"Professor,\" Harry said at last, \"do you think he\\'s getting stronger?\"\\n\\n\"Voldemort?\" said Dumbledore, looking at Harry over the Pensieve. It was the characteristic, piercing look Dumbledore had given him on other occasions, and always made Harry feel as though Dumbledore were seeing right through him in a way that even Moody\\'s magical eye could not. \"Once again. Harry, I can only give you my suspicions.\"\\n\\nDumbledore sighed again, and he looked older, and wearier, than ever.\\n\\n\"The years of Voldemort\\'s ascent to power,\" he said, \"were marked with disappearances. Bertha Jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place where Voldemort was certainly known to be last. Mr. Crouch too has disappeared . . .\\n\\nwithin these very grounds. And there was a third disappearance, one which the Ministry, I regret to say, do not consider of any importance, for it concerns a Muggle. His name was Frank Bryce, he lived in the village where Voldemort\\'s father grew up, and he has not been seen since last August. You see, I read the Muggle newspapers, unlike most of my Ministry friends.\"\\n\\nDumbledore looked very seriously at Harry.\\n\\n\"These disappearances seem to me to be linked. The Ministry disagrees � as you may have heard, while waiting outside my office.\"\\n\\nHarry nodded. Silence fell between them again, Dumbledore extracting thoughts every now and then. Harry felt as though he ought to go, but his curiosity held him in his chair.\\n\\n\"Professor?\" he said again.\\n\\n\"Yes, Harry?\" said Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"Er . . . could I ask you about. . . that court thing I was in ... in the Pensieve?\"\\n\\n\"You could,\" said Dumbledore heavily. \"I attended it many times, but some trials come back to me more clearly than others ... particularly now. ...\"\\n\\n\"You know � you know the trial you found me in? The one with Crouch\\'s son!\\n\\nWell....were they talking about Neville\\'s parents?\"\\n\\nDumbledore gave Harry a very sharp look. \" Has Neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother?\" he said.\\n\\nHarry shook his head, wondering, as he did so, how he could have failed to ask Neville this, in almost four years of knowing him.\\n\\n\"Yes, they were talking about Nevilles parents,\" said Dumbledore. \"His father, Frank, was an Auror just like Professor Moody. He and his wife were tortured for information about Voldemort\\'s whereabouts after he lost his powers, as you heard.\"\\n\\n\"So they\\'re dead?\" said Harry quietly.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Dumbledore, his voice full of a bitterness Harry had never heard there before. \"They are insane. They are both in St. Mungo\\'s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. I believe Neville visits them, with his grandmother, during the holidays. They do not recognize him.\"\\n\\nHarry sat there, horror�struck. He had never known . . . never, in four years, bothered to find out. . .\\n\\n\"The Longbottoms were very popular,\" said Dumbledore. \"The attacks on them came after Voldemort\\'s fall from power, just when everyone thought they were safe. Those attacks caused a wave of fury such as I have never known. The Ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it. Unfortunately, the Longbottoms\\' evidence was � given their condition � none too reliable.\"\\n\\n\"Then Mr. Crouch\\'s son might not have been involved?\" said Harry slowly.\\n\\nDumbledore shook his head.\\n\\n\"As to that, I have no idea.\"\\n\\nHarry sat in silence once more, watching the contents of the Pensieve swirl. There were two more questions he was burning to ask . . . but they concerned the guilt of living people. . . .\\n\\n\"Er,\" he said, \"Mr. Bagman . ..\"\\n\\n\"... has never been accused of any Dark activity since,\" said Dumbledore calmly.\\n\\n\"Right,\" said Harry hastily, staring at the contents of the Pensieve again, which were swirling more slowly now that Dumbledore had stopped adding thoughts.\\n\\n\"And ... er ...\"\\n\\nBut the Pensieve seemed to be asking his question for him.\\n\\nSnape\\'s face was swimming on the surface again. Dumbledore glanced down into it, and then up at Harry.\\n\\n\"No more has Professor Snape,\" he said.\\n\\nHarry looked into Dumbledore\\'s light blue eyes, and the thing he really wanted to know spilled out of his mouth before he could stop it.\\n\\n\"What made you think he\\'d really stopped supporting Voldemort, Professor?\"\\n\\nDumbledore held Harrys gaze for a few seconds, and then said, \"That, Harry, is a matter between Professor Snape and myself.\"\\n\\nHarry knew that the interview was over; Dumbledore did not look angry, yet there was a finality in his tone that told Harry it was time to go. He stood up, and so did Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"Harry,\" he said as Harry reached the door. \"Please do not speak about Neville\\'s parents to anybody else. He has the right to let people know, when he is ready.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Professor,\" said Harry, turning to go.\\n\\n\"And�\"\\n\\nHarry looked back. Dumbledore was standing over the Pensieve, his face lit from beneath by its silvery spots of light, looking older than ever. He stared at Harry for a moment, and then said, \"Good luck with the third task.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY�ONE � THE THIRD TASK\\n\\nDumbledore reckons You�Know�Who\\'s getting stronger again as well?\" Ron whispered.\\n\\nEverything Harry had seen in the Pensieve, nearly everything Dumbledore had told and shown him afterward, he had now shared with Ron and Hermione � and, of course, with Sirius, to whom Harry had sent an owl the moment he had left Dumbledore\\'s office. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night, talking it all over until Harry\\'s mind was reeling, until he understood what Dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off.\\n\\nRon stared into the common room fire. Harry thought he saw Ron shiver slightly, even though the evening was warm.\\n\\n\"And he trusts Snape?\" Ron said. \"He really trusts Snape, even though he knows he was a Death Eater?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry.\\n\\nHermione had not spoken for ten minutes. She was sitting with her forehead in her hands, staring at her knees. Harry thought she too looked as though she could have done with a Pensieve.\\n\\n\"Rita Skeeter,\" she muttered finally.\\n\\n\"How can you be worrying about her now?\" said Ron, in utter disbelief.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not worrying about her,\" Hermione said to her knees. \"I\\'m just thinking. . .\\n\\nremember what she said to me in the Three Broomsticks? \\'I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl. \\' This is what she meant, isn\\'t it!\\n\\nShe reported his trial, she knew he\\'d passed information to the Death Eaters. And Winky too, remember . . .\\'Ludo Bagman\\'s a bad wizard.\\' Mr. Crouch would have been furious he got off, he would have talked about it at home.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, but Bagman didn\\'t pass information on purpose, did he?\"\\n\\nHermione shrugged.\\n\\n\"And Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked Crouch?\" Ron said, turning back to Harry.\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"but he\\'s only saying that because Crouch disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage.\"\\n\\n\"We never thought of her, did we?\" said Ron slowly. \"Mind you, she\\'s definitely got giant blood, and she doesn\\'t want to admit it�\"\\n\\n\"Of course she doesn\\'t,\" said Hermione sharply, looking up. \"Look what happened to Hagrid when Rita found out about his mother. Look at Fudge, jumping to conclusions about her, just because she\\'s part giant. Who needs that sort of prejudice? I\\'d probably say I had big bones if I knew that\\'s what I\\'d get for telling the truth.\"\\n\\nHermione looked at her watch. \"We haven\\'t done any practicing!\" she said, looking shocked. \"We were going to do the Impediment Curse! We\\'ll have to really get down to it tomorrow! Come on. Harry, you need to get some sleep.\"\\n\\nHarry and Ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory. As Harry pulled on his pajamas, he looked over at Nevilles bed. True to his word to Dumbledore, he had not told Ron and Hermione about Neville s parents. As Harry took off his glasses and climbed into his four�poster, he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you. He often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan, but as he listened to Nevilles snores, he thought that Neville deserved it more than he did. Lying in the darkness, Harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured Mr. and Mrs. Longbottom. ... He remembered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch\\'s son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the dementors. ... He understood how they had felt. . . .\\n\\nThen he remembered the milk�white face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later. . . .\\n\\nIt was Voldemort, Harry thought, staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness, it all came back to Voldemort. ... He was the one who had torn these families apart, who had ruined all these lives. . . .\\n\\nRon and Hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams, which would finish on the day of the third task, but they were putting most of their efforts into helping Harry prepare.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry about it,\" Hermione said shortly when Harry pointed this out to them and said he didn\\'t mind practicing on his own for a while, \"at least we\\'ll get top marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts. We\\'d never have found out about all these hexes in class.\"\\n\\n\"Good training for when we\\'re all Aurors,\" said Ron excitedly, attempting the Impediment Curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop dead in midair.\\n\\nThe mood in the castle as they entered June became excited and tense again.\\n\\nEveryone was looking forward to the third task, which would take place a week before the end of term. Harry was practicing hexes at every available moment. He felt more confident about this task than either of the others. Difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be, Moody was right: Harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now, and this time he had some notice, some chance to prepare himself for what lay ahead.\\n\\nTired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all over the school. Professor McGonagall had given them permission to use the empty Transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes. Harry had soon mastered the Impediment Curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the Reductor Curse, which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and the Four�Point Spell, a useful discovery of Hermiones that would make his wand point due north, therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze. He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well�placed Jelly�Legs Jinx, and Harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counter� jinx.\\n\\n\"You\\'re still doing really well, though,\" Hermione said encouragingly, looking down her list and crossing off those spells they had already learned. \"Some of these are bound to come in handy.\"\\n\\n\"Come and look at this,\" said Ron, who was standing by the window. He was staring down onto the grounds. \"What\\'s Malfoy doing?\"\\n\\nHarry and Hermione went to see. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below. Crabbe and Goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout; both were smirking. Malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it.\\n\\n\"He looks like he\\'s using a walkie�talkie,\" said Harry curiously.\\n\\n\"He can\\'t be,\" said Hermione, \"I\\'ve told you, those sorts of things don\\'t work around Hogwarts. Come on, Harry,\" she added briskly, turning away from the window and moving back into the middle of the room, \"let\\'s try that Shield Charm again.\"\\n\\nSirius was sending daily owls now. Like Hermione, he seemed to want to concentrate on getting Harry through the last task before they concerned themselves with anything else. He reminded Harry in every letter that whatever might be going on outside the walls of Hogwarts was not Harry\\'s responsibility, nor was it within his power to influence it.\\n\\nIf Voldemort is really getting stronger again, he wrote, my priority is to ensure your safety. He cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under Dumbledore\\'s protection, but all the same, take no risks: Concentrate on getting through that maze safely, and then we can turn our attention to other matters.\\n\\nHarry\\'s nerves mounted as June the twenty�fourth drew closer, but they were not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks. For one thing, he was confident that, this time, he had done everything in his power to prepare for the task. For another, this was the final hurdle, and however well or badly he did, the tournament would at last be over, which would be an enormous relief.\\n\\nBreakfast was a very noisy affair at the Gryffindor table on the morning of the\\n\\nthird task. The post owls appeared, bringing Harry a good�luck card from Sirius. It was only a piece of parchment, folded over and bearing a muddy paw print on its front, but Harry appreciated it all the same. A screech owl arrived for Hermione, carrying her morning copy of the Daily Prophet as usual. She unfolded the paper, glanced at the front page, and spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over it.\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry and Ron together, staring at her. \"Nothing,\" said Hermione quickly, trying to shove the paper out of sight, but Ron grabbed it. He stared at the headline and said, \"No way. Not today. That old cow.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry. \"Rita Skeeter again?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ron, and just like Hermione, he attempted to push the paper out of sight.\\n\\n\"It\\'s about me, isn\\'t it?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ron, in an entirely unconvincing tone. But before Harry could demand to see the paper. Draco Malfoy shouted across the Great Hall from the Slytherin table.\\n\\n\"Hey, Potter! Potter! How\\'s your head? You feeling all right? Sure you\\'re not going to go berserk on us?\"\\n\\nMalfoy was holding a copy of the Daily Prophet too. Slytherins up and down the table were sniggering, twisting in their seats to see Harry\\'s reaction.\\n\\n\"Let me see it,\" Harry said to Ron. \"Give it here.\"\\n\\nVery reluctantly, Ron handed over the newspaper. Harry turned it over and found himself staring at his own picture, beneath the banner headline: \"HARRY POTTER \"DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS\"\\n\\nThe boy who defeated He�Who�Must�Not�Be�Named is unstable and possibly dangerous, writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. Alarming evidence has recently come to light about Harry Potter\\'s strange behavior, which casts doubts upon his suitability to compete in a demanding competition like the Triwizard Tournament, or even to attend Hogwarts School.\\n\\nPotter, the Daily Prophet can exclusively reveal, regularly collapses at school, and is often heard to complain of pain in the scar on his forehead (relic of the curse with which You�Know�Who attempted to kill him). On Monday last, midway through a Divination lesson, your Daily Prophet reporter witnessed Potter storming from the class, claiming that his scar was hurting too badly to continue studying.\\n\\nIt is possible, say top experts at St. Mungo\\'s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, that Potters brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by You� Know�Who, and that his insistence that the scar is still hurting is an expression of\\n\\nhis deep�seated confusion.\\n\\n\"He might even be pretending,\" said one specialist. \"This could be a plea for attention.\"\\n\\nThe Daily Prophet, however, has unearthed worrying facts about Harry Potter that Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, has carefully concealed from the wizarding public.\\n\\n\"Potter can speak Parseltongue,\" reveals Draco Malfoy, a Hogwarts fourth year.\\n\\n\"There were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago, and most people thought Potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy. It was all hushed up, though. But he\\'s made friends with werewolves and giants too. We think he\\'d do anything for a bit of power.\"\\n\\nParseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long been considered a Dark Art. Indeed, the most famous Parselmouth of our times is none other than You� Know�Who himself. A member of the Dark Force Defense League, who wished to remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak Parseltongue \"as worthy of investigation. Personally, I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are historically associated with evildoers.\"\\n\\nSimilarly, \"anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence.\"\\n\\nAlbus Dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. Some fear that Potter might resort to the Dark Arts in his desperation to win the tournament, the third task of which takes place this evening.\\n\\n\"Gone off me a bit, hasn\\'t she?\" said Harry lightly, folding up the paper.\\n\\nOver at the Slytherin table, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were laughing at him, tapping their heads with their fingers, pulling grotesquely mad faces, and waggling their tongues like snakes.\\n\\n\"How did she know your scar hurt in Divination?\" Ron said. \"There\\'s no way she was there, there\\'s no way she could\\'ve heard �\"\\n\\n\"The window was open,\" said Harry. \"I opened it to breathe.\"\\n\\n\"You were at the top of North Tower!\" Hermione said. \"Your voice couldn\\'t have carried all the way down to the grounds!\"\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'re the one who\\'s supposed to be researching magical methods of bugging!\" said Harry. \"You tell me how she did it!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been trying!\" said Hermione. \"But I... but. . .\"\\n\\nAn odd, dreamy expression suddenly came over Hermione\\'s face. She slowly raised a hand and ran her fingers through her hair.\\n\\n\"Are you all right?\" said Ron, frowning at her.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Hermione breathlessly. She ran her fingers through her hair again, and then held her hand up to her mouth, as though speaking into an invisible walkie� talkie. Harry and Ron stared at each other.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve had an idea,\" Hermione said, gazing into space. \"I think I know. . . because then no one would be able to see ... even Moody. . . and she\\'d have been able to get onto the window ledge . . . but she\\'s not allowed . . . she\\'s definitely not allowed ... I think we\\'ve got her! Just give me two seconds in the library � just to make sure!\"\\n\\nWith that, Hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of the Great Hall.\\n\\n\"Oi!\" Ron called after her. \"We\\'ve got our History of Magic exam in ten minutes!\\n\\nBlimey,\" he said, turning back to Harry, \"she must really hate that Skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam. What\\'re you going to do in Binns\\'s class � read again?\"\\n\\nExempt from the end�of�term tests as a Triwizard champion, Harry had been sitting in the back of every exam class so far, looking up fresh hexes for the third task.\\n\\n\"S\\'pose so,\" Harry said to Ron; but just then. Professor McGonagall came walking alongside the Gryffindor table toward him.\\n\\n\"Potter, the champions are congregating in the chamber off the Hall after breakfast,\" she said.\\n\\n\"But the task\\'s not till tonight!\" said Harry, accidentally spilling scrambled eggs down his front, afraid he had mistaken the time.\\n\\n\"I\\'m aware of that, Potter,\" she said. \"The champions\\' families are invited to watch the final task, you know. This is simply a chance for you to greet them.\"\\n\\nShe moved away. Harry gaped after her.\\n\\n\"She doesn\\'t expect the Dursleys to turn up, does she?\" he asked Ron blankly.\\n\\n\"Dunno,\" said Ron. \"Harry, I\\'d better hurry, I\\'m going to be late for Binns. See you later.\"\\n\\nHarry finished his breakfast in the emptying Great Hall. He saw Fleur Delacour get up from the Ravenclaw table and join Cedric as he crossed to the side chamber and entered. Krum slouched off to join them shortly afterward. Harry stayed where he was. He really didn\\'t want to go into the chamber. He had no family � no family who would turn up to see him risk his life, anyway. But just as he was getting up,\\n\\nthinking that he might as well go up to the library and do a spot more hex research, the door of the side chamber opened, and Cedric stuck his head out.\\n\\n\"Harry, come on, they\\'re waiting for you!\"\\n\\nUtterly perplexed. Harry got up. The Dursleys couldn\\'t possibly be here, could they? He walked across the Hall and opened the door into the chamber.\\n\\nCedric and his parents were just inside the door. Viktor Krum was over in a corner, conversing with his dark�haired mother and father in rapid Bulgarian. He had inherited his fathers hooked nose. On the other side of the room, Fleur was jabbering away in French to her mother. Fleur\\'s little sister, Gabrielle, was holding her mother\\'s hand. She waved at Harry, who waved back, grinning. Then he saw Mrs. Weasley and Bill standing in front of the fireplace, beaming at him.\\n\\n\"Surprise!\" Mrs. Weasley said excitedly as he smiled broadly and walked over to them. \"Thought we\\'d come and watch you. Harry!\" She bent down and kissed him on the cheek.\\n\\n\"You all right?\" said Bill, grinning at Harry and shaking his hand. \"Charlie wanted to come, but he couldn\\'t get time off. He said you were incredible against the Horntail.\"\\n\\nFleur Delacour, Harry noticed, was eyeing Bill with great interest over her mother\\'s shoulder. Harry could tell she had no objection whatsoever to long hair or earrings with fangs on them.\\n\\n\"This is really nice of you,\" Harry muttered to Mrs. Weasley. \"I thought for a moment � the Dursleys �\"\\n\\n\"Hmm,\" said Mrs. Weasley, pursing her lips. She had always refrained from criticizing the Dursleys in front of Harry, but her eyes flashed every time they were mentioned.\\n\\n\"It\\'s great being back here,\" said Bill, looking around the chamber (Violet, the Fat Lady\\'s friend, winked at him from her frame). \"Haven\\'t seen this place for five years. Is that picture of the mad knight still around? Sir Cadogan?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yeah,\" said Harry, who had met Sir Cadogan the previous year.\\n\\n\"And the Fat Lady?\" said Bill.\\n\\n\"She was here in my time,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"She gave me such a telling off one night when I got back to the dormitory at four in the morning �\"\\n\\n\"What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning?\" said Bill, surveying his mother with amazement.\\n\\nMrs. Weasley grinned, her eyes twinkling.\\n\\n\"Your father and I had been for a nighttime stroll,\" she said. \"He got caught by\\n\\nApollyon Pringle � he was the caretaker in those days � your father\\'s still got the marks.\"\\n\\n\"Fancy giving us a tour, Harry?\" said Bill.\\n\\n\"Yeah, okay,\" said Harry, and they made their way back toward the door into the Great Hall. As they passed Amos Diggory, he looked around.\\n\\n\"There you are, are you?\" he said, looking Harry up and down.\\n\\n\"Bet you\\'re not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedrics caught you up on points, are you?\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Ignore him,\" said Cedric in a low voice to Harry, frowning after his father. \"He\\'s been angry ever since Rita Skeeters article about the Triwizard Tournament � you know, when she made out you were the only Hogwarts champion.\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t bother to correct her, though, did he?\" said Amos Diggory, loudly enough for Harry to hear as he started to walk out of the door with Mrs. Weasley and Bill.\\n\\n\"Still, . . you\\'ll show him, Ced. Beaten him once before, haven\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble, Amos!\" Mrs. Weasley said angrily. \"I would have thought you\\'d know that, working at the Ministry!\"\\n\\nMr. Diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry, but his wife laid a hand on his arm, and he merely shrugged and turned away.\\n\\nHarry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny grounds with Bill and Mrs. Weasley, showing them the Beauxbatons carriage and the Durmstrang ship.\\n\\nMrs. Weasley was intrigued by the Whomping Willow, which had been planted after she had left school, and reminisced at length about the gamekeeper before Hagrid, a man called Ogg.\\n\\n\"How\\'s Percy?\" Harry asked as they walked around the greenhouses.\\n\\n\"Not good,\" said Bill.\\n\\n\"He\\'s very upset,\" said Mrs. Weasley, lowering her voice and glancing around.\\n\\n\"The Ministry wants to keep Mr. Crouch\\'s disappearance quiet, but Percy\\'s been hauled in for questioning about the instructions Mr. Crouch has been sending in.\\n\\nThey seem to think there\\'s a chance they weren\\'t genuinely written by him. Percy\\'s been under a lot of strain. They\\'re not letting him fill in for Mr. Crouch as the fifth judge tonight. Cornelius Fudge is going to be doing it.\"\\n\\nThey returned to the castle for lunch.\\n\\n\"Mum � Bill!\" said Ron, looking stunned, as he joined the Gryffindor table.\\n\\n\"What\\'re you doing here?\"\\n\\n\"Come to watch Harry in the last task!\" said Mrs. Weasley brightly. \"I must say, it makes a lovely change, not having to cook. How was your exam?\"\\n\\n\"Oh . . . okay,\" said Ron. \"Couldn\\'t remember all the goblin rebels\\' names, so I invented a few. It\\'s all right,\" he said, helping himself to a Cornish pasty, while Mrs. Weasley looked stern, \"they\\'re all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean; it wasn\\'t hard.\"\\n\\nFred, George, and Ginny came to sit next to them too, and Harry was having such a good time he felt almost as though he were back at the Burrow; he had forgotten to worry about that evening\\'s task, and not until Hermione turned up, halfway through lunch, did he remember that she had had a brainwave about Rita Skeeter.\\n\\n\"Are you going to tell us � ?\"\\n\\nHermione shook her head warningly and glanced at Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\n\"Hello, Hermione,\" said Mrs. Weasley, much more stiffly than usual.\\n\\n\"Hello,\" said Hermione, her smile faltering at the cold expression on Mrs.\\n\\nWeasley\\'s face.\\n\\nHarry looked between them, then said, \"Mrs. Weasley, you didn\\'t believe that rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in Witch Weekly, did you? Because Hermione\\'s not my girlfriend.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Mrs. Weasley \"No � of course I didn\\'t!\"\\n\\nBut she became considerably warmer toward Hermione after that.\\n\\nHarry, Bill, and Mrs. Weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk around the castle, and then returned to the Great Hall for the evening feast. Ludo Bagman and Cornelius Fudge had joined the staff table now. Bagman looked quite cheerful, but Cornelius Fudge, who was sitting next to Madame Maxime, looked stern and was not talking. Madame Maxime was concentrating on her plate, and Harry thought her eyes looked red. Hagrid kept glancing along the table at her, There were more courses than usual, but Harry, who was starting to feel really nervous now, didn\\'t eat much. As the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade from blue to a dusky purple, Dumbledore rose to his feet at the staff table, and silence fell.\\n\\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, in five minutes\\' time, I will be asking you to make your way down to the Quidditch field for the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament. Will the champions please follow Mr. Bagman down to the stadium now.\"\\n\\nHarry got up. The Gryffindors all along the table were applauding him; the Weasleys and Hermione all wished him good luck, and he headed off out of the Great Hall with Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor.\\n\\n\"Feeling all right. Harry?\" Bagman asked as they went down the stone steps onto the grounds. \"Confident?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m okay,\" said Harry. It was sort of true; he was nervous, but he kept running over all the hexes and spells he had been practicing in his mind as they walked, and the knowledge that he could remember them all made him feel better.\\n\\nThey walked onto the Quidditch field, which was now completely unrecognizable.\\n\\nA twenty�foot�high hedge ran all the way around the edge of it. There was a gap right in front of them: the entrance to the vast maze. The passage beyond it looked dark and creepy.\\n\\nFive minutes later, the stands had begun to fill; the air was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats. The sky was a deep, clear blue now, and the first stars were starting to appear. Hagrid, Professor Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached Bagman and the champions. They were wearing large, red, luminous stars on their hats, all except Hagrid, who had his on the back of his moleskin vest.\\n\\n\"We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze,\" said Professor McGonagall to the champions. \"If you get into difficulty, and wish to be rescued, send red sparks into the air, and one of us will come and get you, do you understand?\"\\n\\nThe champions nodded.\\n\\n\"Off you go, then!\" said Bagman brightly to the four patrollers.\\n\\n\"Good luck. Harry,\" Hagrid whispered, and the four of them walked away in different directions, to station themselves around the maze. Bagman now pointed his wand at his throat, muttered, \"Sonorus,\" and his magically magnified voice echoed into the stands.\\n\\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently stand! Tied in first place, with eighty�five points each � Mr. Cedric Diggory and Mr. Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts School!\" The cheers and applause sent birds from the Forbidden Forest fluttering into the darkening sky. \"In second place, with eighty points � Mr.\\n\\nViktor Krum, of Durmstrang Institute!\" More applause. \"And in third place � Miss Fleur Delacour, of Beauxbatons Academy!\"\\n\\nHarry could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione applauding Fleur politely, halfway up the stands. He waved up at them, and they waved back, beaming at him.\\n\\n\"So ... on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!\" said Bagman. \"Three � two � one �\"\\n\\nHe gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forward into the\\n\\nmaze.\\n\\nThe towering hedges cast black shadows across the path, and, whether because they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted, the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze. Harry felt almost as though he were underwater again. He pulled out his wand, muttered, \"Lumos,\" and heard Cedric do the same just behind him.\\n\\nAfter about fifty yards, they reached a fork. They looked at each other.\\n\\n\"See you,\" Harry said, and he took the left one, while Cedric took the right.\\n\\nHarry heard Bagman\\'s whistle for the second time. Krum had entered the maze.\\n\\nHarry sped up. His chosen path seemed completely deserted. He turned right, and hurried on, holding his wand high over his head, trying to see as far ahead as possible. Still, there was nothing in sight.\\n\\nBagman\\'s whistle blew in the distance for the third time. All of the champions were now inside.\\n\\nHarry kept looking behind him. The old feeling that he was being watched was upon him. The maze was growing darker with every passing minute as the sky overhead deepened to navy. He reached a second fork.\\n\\n\"Point Me,\" he whispered to his wand, holding it flat in his palm.\\n\\nThe wand spun around once and pointed toward his right, into solid hedge. That way was north, and he knew that he needed to go northwest for the center of the maze. The best he could do was to take the left fork and go right again as soon as possible.\\n\\nThe path ahead was empty too, and when Harry reached a right turn and took it, he again found his way unblocked. Harry didn\\'t know why, but the lack of obstacles was unnerving him. Surely he should have met something by now? It felt as though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security. Then he heard movement right behind him. He held out his wand, ready to attack, but its beam fell only upon Cedric, who had just hurried out of a path on the right�hand side.\\n\\nCedric looked severely shaken. The sleeve of his robe was smoking.\\n\\n\"Hagrid\\'s Blast�Ended Skrewts!\" he hissed. \"They\\'re enormous � I only just got away!\"\\n\\nHe shook his head and dived out of sight, along another path. Keen to put plenty of distance between himself and the skrewts, Harry hurried off again. Then, as he turned a corner, he saw ... a dementor gliding toward him. Twelve feet tall, its face hidden by its hood, its rotting, scabbed hands outstretched, it advanced, sensing its way blindly toward him. Harry could hear its rattling breath; he felt clammy coldness stealing over him, but knew what he had to do....\\n\\nHe summoned the happiest thought he could, concentrated with all his might on\\n\\nthe thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with Ron and Hermione, raised his wand, and cried, \"Expecto Patronum!\"\\n\\nA silver stag erupted from the end of Harry\\'s wand and galloped toward the dementor, which fell back and tripped over the hem of its robes. . . . Harry had never seen a dementor stumble.\\n\\n\"Hang on!\" he shouted, advancing in the wake of his silver Patronus, \"You\\'re a boggart! Riddikulus!\"\\n\\nThere was a loud crack, and the shape�shifter exploded in a wisp of smoke. The silver stag faded from sight. Harry wished it could have stayed, he could have used some company...but he moved on, quickly and quietly as possible, listening hard, his wand held high once more.\\n\\nLeft ... right... left again . . . Twice he found himself facing dead ends. He did the Four�Point Spell again and found that he was going too far east. He turned back, took a right turn, and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of him.\\n\\nHarry approached it cautiously, pointing the wand\\'s beam at it. This looked like some kind of enchantment. He wondered whether he might be able to blast it out of the way.\\n\\n\"Reducio!\" he said.\\n\\nThe spell shot straight through the mist, leaving it intact. He supposed he should have known better; the Reductor Curse was for solid objects. What would happen if he walked through the mist? Was it worth chancing it, or should he double back!\\n\\nHe was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence.\\n\\n\"Fleur?\" Harry yelled.\\n\\nThere was silence. He stared all around him. What had happened to her? Her scream seemed to have come from somewhere ahead. He took a deep breath and ran through the enchanted mist.\\n\\nThe world turned upside down. Harry was hanging from the ground, with his hair on end, his glasses dangling off his nose, threatening to fall into the bottomless sky. He clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there, terrified. It felt as though his feet were glued to the grass, which had now become the ceiling. Below him the dark, star�spangled heavens stretched endlessly. He felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet, he would fall away from the earth completely.\\n\\nThink, he told himself, as all the blood rushed to his head, think. . .\\n\\nBut not one of the spells he had practiced had been designed to combat a sudden reversal of ground and sky. Did he dare move his foot? He could hear the blood pounding in his ears. He had two choices � try and move, or send up red sparks,\\n\\nand get rescued and disqualified from the task.\\n\\nHe shut his eyes, so he wouldn\\'t be able to see the view of endless space below him, and pulled his right foot as hard as he could away from the grassy ceiling.\\n\\nImmediately, the world righted itself. Harry fell forward onto his knees onto the wonderfully solid ground. He felt temporarily limp with shock. He took a deep, steadying breath, then got up again and hurried forward, looking back over his shoulder as he ran away from the golden mist, which twinkled innocently at him in the moonlight.\\n\\nHe paused at a junction of two paths and looked around for some sign of Fleur. He was sure it had been she who had screamed. What had she met? Was she all right!\\n\\nThere was no sign of red sparks � did that mean she had got herself out of trouble, or was she in such trouble that she couldn\\'t reach her wand? Harry took the right fork with a feeling of increasing unease . . . but at the same time, he couldn\\'t help thinking. One champion down. . .\\n\\nThe cup was somewhere close by, and it sounded as though Fleur was no longer in the running. He\\'d got this far, hadn\\'t he? What if he actually managed to win!\\n\\nFleetingly, and for the first time since he\\'d found himself champion, he saw again that image of himself, raising the Triwizard Cup in front of the rest of the school...\\n\\nHe met nothing for ten minutes, but kept running into dead ends. Twice he took the same wrong turning. Finally, he found a new route and started to jog along it, his wandlight waving, making his shadow flicker and distort on the hedge walls.\\n\\nThen he rounded another corner and found himself facing a Blast�Ended Skrewt.\\n\\nCedric was right � it was enormous. Ten feet long, it looked more like a giant scorpion than anything. Its long sting was curled over its back. Its thick armor glinted in the light from Harry\\'s wand, which he pointed at it.\\n\\n\"Stupefy!\"\\n\\nThe spell hit the skrewt\\'s armor and rebounded; Harry ducked just in time, but could smell burning hair; it had singed the top of his head. The skrewt issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him.\\n\\n\"Impedimenta!\" Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt\\'s armor again and ricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over.\\n\\n\"IMPEDIMENTA!\"\\n\\nThe skrewt was inches from him when it froze � he had managed to hit it on its fleshy, shell�less underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it and ran, hard, in the opposite direction � the Impediment Curse was not permanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.\\n\\nHe took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another; forcing himself to\\n\\nstop, heart hammering, he performed the Four�Point Spell again, backtracked, and chose a path that would take him northwest.\\n\\nHe had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes, when he heard something in the path running parallel to his own that made him stop dead.\\n\\n\"What are you doing?\" yelled Cedric\\'s voice. \"What the hell d\\'you think you\\'re doing?\"\\n\\nAnd then Harry heard Krum\\'s voice.\\n\\n\"Crucio!\"\\n\\nThe air was suddenly full of Cedric\\'s yells. Horrified, Harry began sprinting up his path, trying to find a way into Cedric\\'s. When none appeared, he tried the Reductor Curse again. It wasn\\'t very effective, but it burned a small hole in the hedge through which Harry forced his leg, kicking at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and made an opening; he struggled through it, tearing his robes, and looking to his right, saw Cedric jerking and twitching on the ground, Krum standing over him.\\n\\nHarry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at Krum just as Krum looked up.\\n\\nKrum turned and began to run.\\n\\n\"Stupefy!\" Harry yelled.\\n\\nThe spell hit Krum in the back; he stopped dead in his tracks, fell forward, and lay motionless, facedown in the grass. Harry�dashed over to Cedric, who had stopped twitching and was lying there panting, his hands over his face.\\n\\n\"Are you all right?\" Harry said roughly, grabbing Cedric\\'s arm.\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" panted Cedric. \"Yeah ... I don\\'t believe it... he crept up behind me. ... I heard him, I turned around, and he had his wand on me. . . .\"\\n\\nCedric got up. He was still shaking. He and Harry looked down at Krum.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t believe this ... I thought he was all right,\" Harry said, staring at Krum.\\n\\n\"So did I,\" said Cedric.\\n\\n\"Did you hear Fleur scream earlier?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Cedric. \"You don\\'t think Krum got her too?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Harry slowly.\\n\\n\"Should we leave him here?\" Cedric muttered.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"I reckon we should send up red sparks. Someone\\'ll come and collect him . . . otherwise he\\'ll probably be eaten by a skrewt.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'d deserve it,\" Cedric muttered, but all the same, he raised his wand and shot a shower of red sparks into the air, which hovered high above Krum, marking the spot where he lay.\\n\\nHarry and Cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment, looking around them.\\n\\nThen Cedric said, \"Well... I s\\'pose we\\'d better go on. . . .\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry. \"Oh . . . yeah . . . right. . .\"\\n\\nIt was an odd moment. He and Cedric had been briefly united against Krum � now the fact that they were opponents came back to Harry. The two of them proceeded up the dark path without speaking, then Harry turned left, and Cedric right.\\n\\nCedric\\'s footsteps soon died away.\\n\\nHarry moved on, continuing to use the Four�Point Spell, making sure he was moving in the right direction. It was between him and Cedric now. His desire to reach the cup first was now burning stronger than ever, but he could hardly believe what he\\'d just seen Krum do. The use of an Unforgivable Curse on a fellow human being meant a life term in Azkaban, that was what Moody had told them. Krum surely couldn\\'t have wanted the Triwizard Cup that badly....Harry sped up.\\n\\nEvery so often he hit more dead ends, but the increasing darkness made him feel sure he was getting near the heart of the maze. Then, as he strode down a long, straight path, he saw movement once again, and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature, one which he had only seen in picture form, in his Monster Book of Monsters.\\n\\nIt was a sphinx. It had the body of an over�large lion: great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a woman.\\n\\nShe turned her long, almond�shaped eyes upon Harry as he approached. He raised his wand, hesitating. She was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing from side to side of the path, blocking his progress. Then she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice.\\n\\n\"You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past me.\"\\n\\n\"So ... so will you move, please?\" said Harry, knowing what the answer was going to be.\\n\\n\"No,\" she said, continuing to pace. \"Not unless you can answer my riddle. Answer on your first guess � I let you pass. Answer wrongly � I attack. Remain silent � I will let you walk away from me unscathed.\"\\n\\nHarry\\'s stomach slipped several notches. It was Hermione who was good at this sort of thing, not him. He weighed his chances. If the riddle was too hard, he could keep silent, get away from the sphinx unharmed, and try and find an alternative route to the center.\\n\\n\"Okay,\" he said. \"Can I hear the riddle?\"\\n\\nThe sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very middle of the path, and\\n\\nrecited: \"First think of the person who lives in disguise, Who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies.\\n\\nNext, tell me what\\'s always the last thing to mend, The middle of middle and end of the end!\\n\\nAnd finally give me the sound often heard During the search for a hard�to�find word.\\n\\nNow string them together, and answer me this, Which creature would you be unwilling to kiss?\"\\n\\nHarry gaped at her.\\n\\n\"Could I have it again . . . more slowly?\" he asked tentatively. She blinked at him, smiled, and repeated the poem. \"All the clues add up to a creature I wouldn\\'t want to kiss?\" Harry asked.\\n\\nShe merely smiled her mysterious smile. Harry took that for a \"yes.\" Harry cast his mind around. There were plenty of animals he wouldn\\'t want to kiss; his immediate thought was a Blast�Ended Skrewt, but something told him that wasn\\'t the answer. He\\'d have to try and work out the clues. . . .\\n\\n\"A person in disguise,\" Harry muttered, staring at her, \"who lies ... er ... that\\'d be a � an impostor. No, that\\'s not my guess! A � a spy? I\\'ll come back to that. . . could you give me the next clue again, please?\"\\n\\nShe repeated the next lines of the poem.\\n\\n\"\\'The last thing to mend,\\'\" Harry repeated. \"Er ... no idea . . . \\'middle of middle\\' . . .\\n\\ncould I have the last bit again?\"\\n\\nShe gave him the last four lines.\\n\\n\"\\'The sound often heard during the search for a hard�to�find word,\\'\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Er . . . that\\'d be ... er ... hang on � \\'er\\'! Er\\'s a sound!\"\\n\\nThe sphinx smiled at him.\\n\\n\"Spy ... er ... spy ... er ...\" said Harry, pacing up and down. \"A creature I wouldn\\'t want to kiss . . . a spider!\"\\n\\nThe sphinx smiled more broadly. She got up, stretched her front legs, and then moved aside for him to pass.\\n\\n\"Thanks!\" said Harry, and, amazed at his own brilliance, he dashed forward.\\n\\nHe had to be close now, he had to be. ... His wand was telling him he was bang on course; as long as he didn\\'t meet anything too horrible, he might have a chance. . .\\n\\nHarry broke into a run. He had a choice of paths up ahead. \"Point Me!\" he whispered again to his wand, and it spun around and pointed him to the right�hand one. He dashed up this one and saw light ahead.\\n\\nThe Triwizard Cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards away. Suddenly a dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of him.\\n\\nCedric was going to get there first. Cedric was sprinting as fast as he could toward the cup, and Harry knew he would never catch up, Cedric was much taller, had much longer legs � Then Harry saw something immense over a hedge to his left, moving quickly along a path that intersected with his own; it was moving so fast Cedric was about to run into it, and Cedric, his eyes on the cup, had not seen it � \"Cedric!\" Harry bellowed. \"On your left!\"\\n\\nCedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past the thing and avoid colliding with it, but in his haste, he tripped. Harry saw Cedric\\'s wand fly out of his hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down upon Cedric.\\n\\n\"Stupefy!\" Harry yelled; the spell hit the spider\\'s gigantic, hairy black body, but for all the good it did, he might as well have thrown a stone at it; the spider jerked, scuttled around, and ran at Harry instead.\\n\\n\"Stupefy! Impedimenta! Stupefy!\"\\n\\nBut it was no use � the spider was either so large, or so magical, that the spells were doing no more than aggravating it. Harry had one horrifying glimpse of eight shining black eyes and razor�sharp pincers before it was upon him.\\n\\nHe was lifted into the air in its front legs; struggling madly, he tried to kick it; his leg connected with the pincers and next moment he was in excruciating pain. He could hear Cedric yelling \"Stupefy!\" too, but his spell had no more effect than Harry\\'s � Harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted \"Expelliarmus!\"\\n\\nIt worked � the Disarming Spell made the spider drop him, but that meant that Harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured leg, which crumpled beneath him.\\n\\nWithout pausing to think, he aimed high at the spider\\'s underbelly, as he had done with the skrewt, and shouted \"Stupefy!\\'\\'just as Cedric yelled the same thing.\\n\\nThe two spells combined did what one alone had not: The spider keeled over sideways, flattening a nearby hedge, and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy legs.\\n\\n\"Harry!\" he heard Cedric shouting. \"You all right? Did it fall on you?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" Harry called back, panting. He looked down at his leg. It was bleeding freely. He could see some sort of thick, gluey secretion from the spider\\'s pincers on his torn robes. He tried to get up, but his leg was shaking badly and did not want to support his weight. He leaned against the hedge, gasping for breath, and looked around.\\n\\nCedric was standing feet from the Triwizard Cup, which was gleaming behind him.\\n\\n\"Take it, then,\" Harry panted to Cedric. \"Go on, take it. You\\'re there.\"\\n\\nBut Cedric didn\\'t move. He merely stood there, looking at Harry. Then he turned to stare at the cup. Harry saw the longing expression on his face in its golden light.\\n\\nCedric looked around at Harry again, who was now holding onto the hedge to support himself. Cedric took a deep breath.\\n\\n\"You take it. You should win. That\\'s twice you\\'ve saved my neck in here.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not how it\\'s supposed to work,\" Harry said. He felt angry; his leg was very painful, he was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider, and after all his efforts, Cedric had beaten him to it, just as he\\'d beaten Harry to ask Cho to the ball. \"The one who reaches the cup first gets the points. That\\'s you. I\\'m telling you, I\\'m not going to win any races on this leg.\"\\n\\nCedric took a few paces nearer to the Stunned spider, away from the cup, shaking his head.\\n\\n\"No,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Stop being noble,\" said Harry irritably. \"Just take it, then we can get out of here.\"\\n\\nCedric watched Harry steadying himself, holding tight to the hedge.\\n\\n\"You told me about the dragons,\" Cedric said. \"I would\\'ve gone down in the first task if you hadn\\'t told me what was coming.\"\\n\\n\"I had help on that too,\" Harry snapped, trying to mop up his bloody leg with his robes. \"You helped me with the egg � we\\'re square.\"\\n\\n\"I had help on the egg in the first place,\" said Cedric.\\n\\n\"We\\'re still square,\" said Harry, testing his leg gingerly; it shook violently as he put weight on it; he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped him.\\n\\n\"You should\\'ve got more points on the second task,\" said Cedric mulishly. \"You stayed behind to get all the hostages. I should\\'ve done that.\"\\n\\n\"I was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously!\" said Harry bitterly. \"Just take the cup!\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Cedric.\\n\\nHe stepped over the spider\\'s tangled legs to join Harry, who stared at him. Cedric was serious. He was walking away from the sort of glory Hufflepuff House hadn\\'t had in centuries.\\n\\n\"Go on,\" Cedric said. He looked as though this was costing him every ounce of resolution he had, but his face was set, his arms were folded, he seemed decided.\\n\\nHarry looked from Cedric to the cup. For one shining moment, he saw himself emerging from the maze, holding it. He saw himself holding the Triwizard Cup aloft, heard the roar of the crowd, saw Cho\\'s face shining with admiration, more clearly than he had ever seen it before . . . and then the picture faded, and he found himself staring at Cedric\\'s shadowy, stubborn face.\\n\\n\"Both of us,\" Harry said.\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll take it at the same time. It\\'s still a Hogwarts victory. We\\'ll tie for it.\"\\n\\nCedric stared at Harry. He unfolded his arms.\\n\\n\"You � you sure?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"Yeah . . . we\\'ve helped each other out, haven\\'t we? We both got here. Let\\'s just take it together.\"\\n\\nFor a moment, Cedric looked as though he couldn\\'t believe his ears; then his face split in a grin.\\n\\n\"You\\'re on,\" he said. \"Come here.\"\\n\\nHe grabbed Harrys arm below the shoulder and helped Harry limp toward the plinth where the cup stood. When they had reached it, they both held a hand out over one of the cup\\'s gleaming handles.\\n\\n\"On three, right?\" said Harry. \"One � two � three �\"\\n\\nHe and Cedric both grasped a handle.\\n\\nInstantly, Harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel. His feet had left the ground. He could not unclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup; it was pulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling color, Cedric at his side.\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY�TWO � FLESH, BLOOD, AND BONE\\n\\nHarry felt his feet slam into the ground; his injured leg gave way, and he fell forward; his hand let go of the Triwizard Cup at last. He raised his head.\\n\\n\"Where are we?\" he said.\\n\\nCedric shook his head. He got up, pulled Harry to his feet, and they looked around.\\n\\nThey had left the Hogwarts grounds completely; they had obviously traveled miles � perhaps hundreds of miles � for even the mountains surrounding the castle were gone. They were standing instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard; the black outline of a small church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right. A hill rose above them to their left. Harry could just make out the outline of a fine old house on the hillside.\\n\\nCedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up at Harry.\\n\\n\"Did anyone tell you the cup was a Portkey?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Nope,\" said Harry. He was looking around the graveyard. It was completely silent and slightly eerie. \"Is this supposed to be part of the task?\"\\n\\n\"I dunno,\" said Cedric. He sounded slightly nervous. \"Wands out, d\\'you reckon?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, glad that Cedric had made the suggestion rather than him.\\n\\nThey pulled out their wands. Harry kept looking around him. He had, yet again, the strange feeling that they were being watched.\\n\\n\"Someone\\'s coming,\" he said suddenly.\\n\\nSquinting tensely through the darkness, they watched the figure drawing nearer, walking steadily toward them between the graves. Harry couldn\\'t make out a face, but from the way it was walking and holding its arms, he could tell that it was carrying something. Whoever it was, he was short, and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face. And � several paces nearer, the gap between them closing all the time � Harry saw that the thing in the persons arms looked like a baby ... or was it merely a bundle of robes!\\n\\nHarry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric. Cedric shot him a quizzical look. They both turned back to watch the approaching figure.\\n\\nIt stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only six feet from them. For a second. Harry and Cedric and the short figure simply looked at one another.\\n\\nAnd then, without warning, Harry\\'s scar exploded with pain. It was agony such as\\n\\nhe had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all; his head was about to split open.\\n\\nFrom far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say, \"Kill the spare.\"\\n\\nA swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words to the night: \"Avada Kedavra!\"\\n\\nA blast of green light blazed through Harry\\'s eyelids, and he heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him; the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that he retched, and then it diminished; terrified of what he was about to see, he opened his stinging eyes.\\n\\nCedric was lying spread�eagled on the ground beside him. He was dead.\\n\\nFor a second that contained an eternity, Harry stared into Cedric\\'s face, at his open gray eyes, blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted house, at his half�open mouth, which looked slightly surprised. And then, before Harry\\'s mind had accepted what he was seeing, before he could feel anything but numb disbelief, he felt himself being pulled to his feet.\\n\\nThe short man in the cloak had put down his bundle, lit his wand, and was dragging Harry toward the marble headstone. Harry saw the name upon it flickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed against it.\\n\\nTOM RIDDLE The cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around Harry, tying him from neck to ankles to the headstone. Harry could hear shallow, fast breathing from the depths of the hood; he struggled, and the man hit him � hit him with a hand that had a finger missing. And Harry realized who was under the hood. It was Wormtail.\\n\\n\"You!\" he gasped.\\n\\nBut Wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes, did not reply; he was busy checking the tightness of the cords, his fingers trembling uncontrollably, rumbling over the knots. Once sure that Harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn\\'t move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into Harry\\'s mouth; then, without a word, he turned from Harry and hurried away. Harry couldn\\'t make a sound, nor could he see where Wormtail had gone; he couldn\\'t turn his head to see beyond the headstone; he could see only what was right in front of him.\\n\\nCedric\\'s body was lying some twenty feet away. Some way beyond him, glinting in the starlight, lay the Triwizard Cup. Harry\\'s wand was on the ground at Cedric\\'s feet. The bundle of robes that Harry had thought was a baby was close by, at the foot of the grave. It seemed to be stirring fretfully. Harry watched it, and his scar\\n\\nseared with pain again . . . and he suddenly knew that he didn\\'t want to see what was in those robes ... he didn\\'t want that bundle opened....\\n\\nHe could hear noises at his feet. He looked down and saw a gigantic snake slithering through the grass, circling the headstone where he was tied. Wormtail\\'s fast, wheezy breathing was growing louder again. It sounded as though he was forcing something heavy across the ground. Then he came back within Harry\\'s range of vision, and Harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to the foot of the grave. It was full of what seemed to be water � Harry could hear it slopping around � and it was larger than any cauldron Harry had ever used; a great stone belly large enough for a full�grown man to sit in.\\n\\nThe thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring more persistently, as though it was trying to free itself. Now Wormtail was busying himself at the bottom of the cauldron with a wand. Suddenly there were crackling names beneath it. The large snake slithered away into the darkness.\\n\\nThe liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast. The surface began not only to bubble, but to send out fiery sparks, as though it were on fire. Steam was thickening, blurring the outline of Wormtail tending the fire. The movements beneath the robes became more agitated. And Harry heard the high, cold voice again.\\n\\n\"Hurry!\"\\n\\nThe whole surface of the water was alight with sparks now. It might have been encrusted with diamonds.\\n\\n\"It is ready. Master.\"\\n\\n\"Now ...\" said the cold voice.\\n\\nWormtail pulled open the robes on the ground, revealing what was inside them, and Harry let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking his mouth.\\n\\nIt was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed something ugly, slimy, and blind � but worse, a hundred times worse. The thing Wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child, except that Harry had never seen anything less like a child. It was hairless and scaly�looking, a dark, raw, reddish black. Its arms and legs were thin and feeble, and its face � no child alive ever had a face like that � flat and snakelike, with gleaming red eyes.\\n\\nThe thing seemed almost helpless; it raised its thin arms, put them around Wormtail\\'s neck, and Wormtail lifted it. As he did so, his hood fell back, and Harry saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail\\'s weak, pale face in the firelight as he carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron. For one moment, Harry saw the evil, flat face illuminated in the sparks dancing on the surface of the potion. And then Wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron; there was a hiss, and it\\n\\nvanished below the surface; Harry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft thud.\\n\\nLet it drown, Harry thought, his scar burning almost past endurance, please. . . let it drown. . . .\\n\\nWormtail was speaking. His voice shook; he seemed frightened beyond his wits.\\n\\nHe raised his wand, closed his eyes, and spoke to the night.\\n\\n\"Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you wil lrenew your son!\"\\n\\nThe surface of the grave at Harry\\'s feet cracked. Horrified, Harry watched as a fine trickle of dust rose into the air at Wormtail\\'s command and fell softly into the cauldron. The diamond surface of the water broke and hissed; it sent sparks in all directions and turned a vivid, poisonous�looking blue.\\n\\nAnd now Wormtail was whimpering. He pulled a long, thin, shining silver dagger from inside his cloak. His voice broke into petrified sobs.\\n\\n\"Flesh � of the servant � w�willingly given � you will � revive � your master. \"\\n\\nHe stretched his right hand out in front of him � the hand with the missing finger.\\n\\nHe gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it upward.\\n\\nHarry realized what Wormtail was about to do a second before it happened � he closed his eyes as tightly as he could, but he could not block the scream that pierced the night, that went through Harry as though he had been stabbed with the dagger too. He heard something fall to the ground, heard Wormtail\\'s anguished panting, then a sickening splash, as something was dropped into the cauldron.\\n\\nHarry couldn\\'t stand to look . . . but the potion had turned a burning red; the light of it shone through Harry\\'s closed eyelids. . . .\\n\\nWormtail was gasping and moaning with agony. Not until Harry felt Wormtail\\'s anguished breath on his face did he realize that Wormtail was right in front of him.\\n\\n\"B�blood of the enemy . . . forcibly taken .. . you will. . . resurrect your foe.\"\\n\\nHarry could do nothing to prevent it, he was tied too tightly. . .. Squinting down, struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him, he saw the shining silver dagger shaking in Wormtails remaining hand. He felt its point penetrate the crook of his right arm and blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes. Wormtail, still panting with pain, rumbled in his pocket for a glass vial and held it to Harry\\'s cut, so that a dribble of blood fell into it.\\n\\nHe staggered back to the cauldron with Harrys blood. He poured it inside. The liquid within turned, instantly, a blinding white. Wormtail, his job done, dropped to his knees beside the cauldron, then slumped sideways and lay on the ground, cradling the bleeding stump of his arm, gasping and sobbing.\\n\\nThe cauldron was simmering, sending its diamond sparks in all directions, so\\n\\nblindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety blackness. Nothing happened. . . .\\n\\nLet it have drowned. Harry thought, let it have gone wrong. . . � And then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished. A surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead, obliterating everything in front of Harry, so that he couldn\\'t see Wormtail or Cedric or anything but vapor hanging in the air. ... It\\'s gone wrong, he thought. . . it\\'s drowned. .. please . . . please let it be dead. ...\\n\\nBut then, through the mist in front of him, he saw, with an icy surge of terror, the dark outline of a man, tall and skeletally thin, rising slowly from inside the cauldron.\\n\\n\"Robe me,\" said the high, cold voice from behind the steam, and Wormtail, sobbing and moaning, still cradling his mutilated arm, scrambled to pick up the black robes from the ground, got to his feet, reached up, and pulled them one� handed over his master\\'s head.\\n\\nThe thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at Harry . . . and Harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years. Whiter than a skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was flat as a snakes with slits for nostrils . . .\\n\\nLord Voldemort had risen again.\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY�THREE � THE DEATH EATERS\\n\\nVoldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body. His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cats, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness. He held up his hands and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally long�fingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh.\\n\\nWormtail\\'s robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them.\\n\\n\"My Lord . . .\" he choked, \"my Lord . . . you promised . . . you did promise ...\"\\n\\n\"Hold out your arm,\" said Voldemort lazily.\\n\\n\"Oh Master . . . thank you, Master ...\"\\n\\nHe extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort laughed again.\\n\\n\"The other arm, Wormtail.\"\\n\\n\"Master, please . . .please ...\"\\n\\nVoldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail\\'s left arm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail\\'s robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo � a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth � the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail\\'s uncontrollable weeping.\\n\\n\"It is back,\" he said softly, \"they will all have noticed it... and now, we shall see ...\\n\\nnow we shall know ...\"\\n\\nHe pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail\\'s arm.\\n\\nThe scar on Harry s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl; Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail\\'s mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black.\\n\\nA look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened up, threw back his\\n\\nhead, and stared around at the dark graveyard.\\n\\n\"How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?\" he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. \"And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?\"\\n\\nHe began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail, eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while. After a minute or so, he looked down at Harry again, a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face.\\n\\n\"You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father,\" he hissed softly. \"A Muggle and a fool. . . very like your dear mother. But they both had their uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child . . . and I killed my father, and see how useful he has proved himself, in death. ...\"\\n\\nVoldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all around him as he walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass.\\n\\n\"You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there. My mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with him. But he abandoned her when she told him what she was. ... He didn\\'t like magic, my father . . .\\n\\n\"He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born. Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage . . . but I vowed to find him ... I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name . . . Tom Riddle. . . .\"\\n\\nStill he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave.\\n\\n\"Listen to me, reliving family history . . .\" he said quietly, \"why, I am growing quite sentimental. . . . But look, Harry! My true family returns. . . .\"\\n\\nThe air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks. Between graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating. All of them were hooded and masked. And one by one they moved forward . . . slowly, cautiously, as though they could hardly believe their eyes Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them. Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robes.\\n\\nMaster . . . Master \" he murmured.\\n\\nThe Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle s grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. He looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered.\\n\\n\"Welcome, Death Eaters,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"Thirteen years. . . thirteen years since last we met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday, we are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or are we?\"\\n\\nHe put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slit�like nostrils widening.\\n\\n\"I smell guilt,\" he said. \"There is a stench or guilt upon the air.\\n\\nA second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it longed, but did not dare to step back from him.\\n\\n\"I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact � such prompt appearances! and I ask myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty?\"\\n\\nNo one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding arm.\\n\\n\"And I answer myself,\" whispered Voldemort, \"they must have believed me broken, they thought I was gone. They slipped back among my enemies, and they pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment. . . .\\n\\n\"And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again!\\n\\nThey, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death!\\n\\nThey, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living!\\n\\n\"And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort. . . perhaps they now pay allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?\"\\n\\nAt the mention of Dumbledore\\'s name, the members of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them.\\n\\n\"It is a disappointment to me ... I confess myself disappointed. . . .\"\\n\\nOne of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort\\'s feet.\\n\\n\"Master!\" he shrieked, \"Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!\"\\n\\nVoldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand.\\n\\n\"Crucio!\"\\n\\nThe Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the police come, he thought desperately . .\\n\\n. anyone . .. anything. . .\\n\\nVoldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground,\\n\\ngasping.\\n\\n\"Get up, Avery,\" said Voldemort softly. \"Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years ... I want thirteen years\\' repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you not, Wormtail?\"\\n\\nHe looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob.\\n\\n\"You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Master,\" moaned Wormtail, \"please. Master . . . please ...\"\\n\\n\"Yet you helped return me to my body,\" said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground. \"Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me ... and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers... .\"\\n\\nVoldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand\\'s wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtails bleeding wrist.\\n\\nWormtail\\'s sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder.\\n\\n\"My Lord,\" he whispered. \"Master ... it is beautiful. . . thank you... thank you. ...\"\\n\\nHe scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort\\'s robes.\\n\\n\"May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,\" said Voldemort.\\n\\n\"No, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . .\"\\n\\nWormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail\\'s right.\\n\\n\"Lucius, my slippery friend,\" he whispered, halting before him. \"I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle�torture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius. . . . Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay. . . but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?\"\\n\\n\"My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,\" came Lucius Malfoy\\'s voice swiftly from beneath the hood. \"Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your\\n\\nwhereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me �\"\\n\\n\"And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?\" said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly.\\n\\n\"Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have disappointed me. ... I expect more faithful service in the future.\"\\n\\n\"Of course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank you. ...\"\\n\\nVoldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space � large enough for two people � that separated Malfoy and the next man.\\n\\n\"The Lestranges should stand here,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"But they are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me. . . . When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us ... they are our natural allies ... we will recall the banished giants ... I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear. ...\"\\n\\nHe walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused before others and spoke to them.\\n\\n\"Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord Voldemort will provide. ...\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Master . . . thank you,\" murmured Macnair.\\n\\n\"And here\" � Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures � \"we have Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you, Goyle?\"\\n\\nThey bowed clumsily, muttering dully.\\n\\n\"Yes, Master ...\"\\n\\n\"We will, Master....\"\\n\\n\"The same goes for you, Nott,\" said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in Mr. Goyles shadow.\\n\\n\"My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful �\"\\n\\n\"That will do,\" said Voldemort.\\n\\nHe had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there.\\n\\n\"And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return ... he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever ... he will be killed, of course . . . and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and\\n\\nwho has already reentered my service.\"\\n\\nThe Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks.\\n\\n\"He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight. . . .\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry\\'s direction. \"Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.\"\\n\\nThere was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy\\'s voice spoke from under the mask.\\n\\n\"Master, we crave to know ... we beg you to tell us ... how you have achieved this .\\n\\n. . this miracle . . . how you managed to return to us. .. .\"\\n\\n\"Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,\" said Voldemort. \"And it begins � and ends � with my young friend here.\"\\n\\nHe walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them. The snake continued to circle.\\n\\n\"You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?\" Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony. \"You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in the attempt to save him � and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen. ... I could not touch the boy.\"\\n\\nVoldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry\\'s cheek.\\n\\n\"His mother left upon him the traces other sacrifice. . . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it... but no matter. I can touch him now.\"\\n\\nHarry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters.\\n\\n\"I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by the woman\\'s foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain beyond pain, my friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive. What I was, even I do not know... I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality. You know my goal � to conquer death. And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked ... for I had not been killed, though the curse should have done it. Nevertheless, I was as\\n\\npowerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help myself...\\n\\nfor I had no body, and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand. . . .\\n\\n\"I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to exist. ... I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I waited. . . . Surely, one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me. . . one of them would come and perform the magic I could not, to restore me to a body . . , but I waited in vain. ...\"\\n\\nThe shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters. Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing.\\n\\n\"Only one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies of others. But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me.\\n\\nI sometimes inhabited animals � snakes, of course, being my preference � but I was little better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic . . . and my possession of them shortened their lives; none of them lasted long. . . .\\n\\n\"Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed assured. A wizard � young, foolish, and gullible � wandered across my path in the forest I had made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of... for he was a teacher at Dumbledore\\'s school... he was easy to bend to my will... he brought me back to this country, and after a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan failed. I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer\\'s Stone. I was not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted . . .\\n\\nthwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. ...\"\\n\\nSilence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree. The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry.\\n\\n\"The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had been,\"\\n\\nVoldemort continued. \"I returned to my hiding place far away, and I will not pretend to you that I didn\\'t then fear that I might never regain my powers. . . . Yes, that was perhaps my darkest hour... I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to possess . . . and I had given up hope, now, that any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me. ...\"\\n\\nOne or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but Voldemort took no notice.\\n\\n\"And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost abandoned hope, it happened at last... a servant returned to me. Wormtail here, who had faked his own death to escape justice, was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends, and decided to return to his master. He sought me in the country where it had long been rumored I was hiding . . . helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way.\\n\\nWormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do you not, Wormtail? His filthy little friends told him there was a place, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided, where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them. . . .\\n\\n\"But his journey back to me was not smooth, was it, Wormtail? For, hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who should he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a witch from the Ministry of Magic.\\n\\n\"Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. This might have been the end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail � displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected from him � convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll. He overpowered her ... he brought her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might have ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams ... for � with a little persuasion � she became a veritable mine of information.\\n\\n\"She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too willing to help me, if I could only contact him. She told me many things. . . but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and when I had extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair. She had now served her purpose. I could not possess her.\\n\\nI disposed of her.\"\\n\\nVoldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless.\\n\\n\"Wormtail\\'s body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed. However, he was the able�bodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth ... a spell or two of my own invention ... a little help from my dear Nagini,\" Voldemorts red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, \"a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided ... I was soon returned to an almost human form, and strong enough to travel.\\n\\n\"There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer\\'s Stone anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower ... I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength.\\n\\n\"I knew that to achieve this � it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight � I would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one of them was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail? Flesh given by a servant. . . .\\n\\n\"My father\\'s bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here, where he was buried. But the blood of a foe ... Wormtail would have had me use any wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who had hated me ... as so many of them still do. But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted Harry Potters blood. I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . . for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too. .\\n\\n\"But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been better protected than I think even he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy\\'s future. Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the boy\\'s protection as long as he is in his relations\\' care. Not even I can touch him there. . . . Then, of course, there was the Quidditch World Cup. ... I thought his protection might be weaker there, away from his relations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards. And then, the boy would return to Hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that Muggle�loving fool from morning until night. So how could I take him!\\n\\n\"Why ... by using Bertha Jorkins\\'s information, of course. Use my one faithful Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that the boy\\'s name was entered into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament � that he touched the Triwizard Cup first � the cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring him here, beyond the reach of Dumbledore\\'s help and protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is ... the boy you all believed had been my downfall. ...\"\\n\\nVoldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He raised his wand.\\n\\n\"Crucio!\"\\n\\nIt was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end ... to black out... to die ...\\n\\nAnd then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort\\'s father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the Death Eaters\\' laughter.\\n\\n\"You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me,\" said Voldemort. \"But I want there to be no mistake in anybody\\'s mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini,\" he whispered, and the snake glided away through the grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching.\\n\\n\"Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his wand.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY�FOUR � PRIORI INCANTATEM\\n\\nWormtail approached Harry, who scrambled to find his feet, to support his own weight before the ropes were untied. Wormtail raised his new silver hand, pulled out the wad of material gagging Harry, and then, with one swipe, cut through the bonds tying Harry to the gravestone.\\n\\nThere was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might have considered running for it, but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave, as the Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter circle around him and Voldemort, so that the gaps where the missing Death Eaters should have stood were filled.\\n\\nWormtail walked out of the circle to the place where Cedric\\'s body lay and returned with Harry\\'s wand, which he thrust roughly into Harry\\'s hand without looking at him. Then Wormtail resumed his place in the circle of watching Death Eaters.\\n\\n\"You have been taught how to duel. Harry Potter?\" said Voldemort softly, his red eyes glinting through the darkness.\\n\\nAt these words Harry remembered, as though from a former life, the dueling club at Hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago. ... All he had learned there was the Disarming Spell, \"Expelliarmus\". . . and what use would it be to deprive Voldemort of his wand, even if he could, when he was surrounded by Death Eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one? He had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this. He knew he was facing the thing against which Moody had always warned . . . the unblockable Avada Kedavra curse � and Voldemort was right � his mother was not here to die for him this time. ... He was quite unprotected. . . .\\n\\n\"We bow to each other. Harry,\" said Voldemort, bending a little, but keeping his snakelike face upturned to Harry. \"Come, the niceties must be observed. . . .\\n\\nDumbledore would like you to show manners. . . . Bow to death, Harry. ...\"\\n\\nThe Death Eaters were laughing again. Voldemorts lipless mouth was smiling.\\n\\nHarry did not bow. He was not going to let Voldemort play with him before killing him ... he was not going to give him that satisfaction. . . .\\n\\n\"I said, bow,\" Voldemort said, raising his wand � and Harry felt his spine curve as though a huge, invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly forward, and the Death Eaters laughed harder than ever.\\n\\n\"Very good,\" said Voldemort softly, and as he raised his wand the pressure bearing down upon Harry lifted too. \"And now you face me, like a man . . .\\n\\nstraight�backed and proud, the way your father died. . . .\\n\\n\"And now � we duel.\"\\n\\nVoldemort raised his wand, and before Harry could do anything to defend himself, before he could even move, he had been hit again by the Cruciatus Curse. The pain was so intense, so all�consuming, that he no longer knew where he was. . . .\\n\\nWhite�hot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely going to burst with pain, he was screaming more loudly than he\\'d ever screamed in his life � And then it stopped. Harry rolled over and scrambled to his feet; he was shaking as uncontrollably as Wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off; he staggered sideways into the wall of watching Death Eaters, and they pushed him away, back toward Voldemort.\\n\\n\"A little break,\" said Voldemort, the slit�like nostrils dilating with excitement, \"a little pause . . . That hurt, didn\\'t it. Harry? You don\\'t want me to do that again, do you?\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t answer. He was going to die like Cedric, those pitiless red eyes were telling him so ... he was going to die, and there was nothing he could do about it...\\n\\nbut he wasn\\'t going to play along. He wasn\\'t going to obey Voldemort... he wasn\\'t going to beg. . . .\\n\\n\"I asked you whether you want me to do that again,\" said Voldemort softly.\\n\\n\"Answer me! Imperial\"\\n\\nAnd Harry felt, for the third time in his life, the sensation that his mind had been wiped of all thought. . . . Ah, it was bliss, not to think, it was as though he were floating, dreaming ...just answer no ... say no ... just answer no. .. .\\n\\nI will not, said a stronger voice, in the back of his head, I won\\'t answer. . . .\\n\\nJust answer no. . . .\\n\\nI won\\'t do it, I won\\'t say it. ...\\n\\nJust answer no. . . .\\n\\n\"I WON\\'T!\"\\n\\nAnd these words burst from Harry\\'s mouth; they echoed through the graveyard, and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been thrown over him � back rushed the aches that the Cruciatus Curse had left all over his body � back rushed the realization of where he was, and what he was facing. . . .\\n\\n\"You won\\'t?\" said Voldemort quietly, and the Death Eaters were not laughing now. \"You won\\'t say no? Harry, obedience is a virtue I need to teach you before you die. . . . Perhaps another little dose of pain?\"\\n\\nVoldemort raised his wand, but this time Harry was ready; with the reflexes born of his Quidditch training, he flung himself sideways onto the ground; he rolled behind the marble headstone of Voldemort s father, and he heard it crack as the\\n\\ncurse missed him.\\n\\n\"We are not playing hide�and�seek, Harry,\" said Voldemort\\'s soft, cold voice, drawing nearer, as the Death Eaters laughed. \"You cannot hide from me. Does this mean you are tired of our duel? Does this mean that you would prefer me to finish it now, Harry? Come out, Harry . . . come out and play, then ... it will be quick ... it might even be painless ... I would not know... I have never died. . . .\"\\n\\nHarry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come. There was no hope ... no help to be had. And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason: He was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide�and�seek; he was not going to die kneeling at Voldemort s feet... he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defense was possible. . . .\\n\\nBefore Voldemort could stick his snakelike face around the headstone. Harry stood up ... he gripped his wand tightly in his hand, thrust it out in front of him, and threw himself around the headstone, facing Voldemort.\\n\\nVoldemort was ready. As Harry shouted, \"Expelliarmus!\" Voldemort cried, \"Avada Kedavra!\"\\n\\nA jet of green light issued from Voldemorts wand just as a jet of red light blasted from Harry\\'s � they met in midair � and suddenly Harry\\'s wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it; his hand seized up around it; he couldn\\'t have released it if he\\'d wanted to � and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands, neither red nor green, but bright, deep gold. Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw that Voldemort\\'s long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating.\\n\\nAnd then � nothing could have prepared Harry for this � he felt his feet lift from the ground. He and Voldemort were both being raised into the air, their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light. They glided away from the tombstone of Voldemort\\'s father and then came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves. . . . The Death Eaters were shouting; they were asking Voldemort for instructions; they were closing in, reforming the circle around Harry and Voldemort, the snake slithering at their heels, some of them drawing their wands � The golden thread connecting Harry and Voldemort splintered; though the wands remained connected, a thousand more beams arced high over Harry and Voldemort, crisscrossing all around them, until they were enclosed in a golden, dome�shaped web, a cage of light, beyond which the Death Eaters circled like jackals, their cries strangely muffled now. . . .\\n\\n\"Do nothing!\" Voldemort shrieked to the Death Eaters, and Harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening, saw him fighting to break the\\n\\nthread of light still connecting his wand with Harry\\'s; Harry held onto his wand more tightly, with both hands, and the golden thread remained unbroken. \"Do nothing unless I command you!\" Voldemort shouted to the Death Eaters.\\n\\nAnd then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the air. ... It was coming from every thread of the light�spun web vibrating around Harry and Voldemort. It was a sound Harry recognized, though he had heard it only once before in his life: phoenix song.\\n\\nIt was the sound of hope to Harry. . . the most beautiful and welcome thing he had ever heard in his life. . . . He felt as though the song were inside him instead of just around him. ... It was the sound he connected with Dumbledore, and it was almost as though a friend were speaking in his ear. . . .\\n\\nDon\\'t break the connection.\\n\\nI know. Harry told the music, I know I mustn\\'t. . . but no sooner had he thought it, than the thing became much harder to do. His wand began to vibrate more powerfully than ever . . . and now the beam between him and Voldemort changed too ... it was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands � Harry felt his wand give a shudder under his hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his way. . . . The direction of the beams movement was now toward him, from Voldemort, and he felt his wand shudder angrily. . . .\\n\\nAs the closest bead of light moved nearer to Harrys wand tip, the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame. The closer that bead moved, the harder Harry\\'s wand vibrated; he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it; it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers � He concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back toward Voldemort, his ears full of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixed . . . and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they began to move the other way . . . and it was Voldemort\\'s wand that was vibrating extra�hard now . . . Voldemort who looked astonished, and almost fearful. . . .\\n\\nOne of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of Voldemorts wand.\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t understand why he was doing it, didn\\'t know what it might achieve . .\\n\\n. but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on forcing that bead of light right back into Voldemort s wand . . . and slowly . . . very slowly ... it moved along the golden thread ... it trembled for a moment. . . and then it connected. . . .\\n\\nAt once, Voldemorts wand began to emit echoing screams of pain . . . then � Voldemort\\'s red eyes widened with shock � a dense, smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanished . . . the ghost of the hand he had made Wormtail. . . more shouts of pain . . . and then something much larger began to blossom from Voldemorts wand tip, a great, grayish something, that looked as though it were made of the solidest, densest smoke. ... It was a head . . . now a chest and arms . . .\\n\\nthe torso of Cedric Diggory.\\n\\nIf ever Harry might have released his wand from shock, it would have been then, but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of golden light remained unbroken, even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric Diggory (was it a ghost? it looked so solid) emerged in its entirety from the end of Voldemort s wand, as though it were squeezing itself out of a very narrow tunnel. . . and this shade of Cedric stood up, and looked up and down the golden thread of light, and spoke.\\n\\n\"Hold on. Harry,\" it said.\\n\\nIts voice was distant and echoing. Harry looked at Voldemort ... his wide red eyes were still shocked ... he had no more expected this than Harry had . . . and, very dimly. Harry heard the frightened yells of the Death Eaters, prowling around the edges of the golden dome. .\\n\\nMore screams of pain from the wand . . . and then something else emerged from its tip ... the dense shadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms and torso ...\\n\\nan old man Harry had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the wand just as Cedric had done . . . and his ghost, or his shadow, or whatever it was, fell next to Cedric\\'s, and surveyed Harry and Voldemort, and the golden web, and the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning on his walking stick. . . .\\n\\n\"He was a real wizard, then?\" the old man said, his eyes on Voldemort. \"Killed me, that one did. . . . You fight him, boy. . . .\"\\n\\nBut already, yet another head was emerging ... and this head, gray as a smoky statue, was a woman\\'s. . . . Harry, both arms shaking now as he fought to keep his wand still, saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others, staring. . . .\\n\\nThe shadow of Bertha Jorkins surveyed the battle before her with wide eyes.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t let go, now!\" she cried, and her voice echoed like Cedrics as though from very far away. \"Don\\'t let him get you, Harry � don\\'t let go!\"\\n\\nShe and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the golden web, while the Death Eaters flitted around the outside of it... and Voldemort\\'s dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers, whispered words of encouragement to Harry, and hissed words Harry couldn\\'t hear to Voldemort.\\n\\nAnd now another head was emerging from the tip of Voldemorts wand . . . and Harry knew when he saw it who it would be ... he knew, as though he had expected it from the moment when Cedric had appeared from the wand . . . knew, because the man appearing was the one he\\'d thought of more than any other tonight. . . .\\n\\nThe smoky shadow of a tall man with untidy hair fell to the ground as Bertha had\\n\\ndone, straightened up, and looked at him . . . and Harry, his arms shaking madly now, looked back into the ghostly face of his father.\\n\\n\"Your mother\\'s coming . . .\" he said quietly. \"She wants to see you ... it will be all right.. . hold on. . . .\"\\n\\nAnd she came. . . first her head, then her body... a young woman with long hair, the smoky, shadowy form of Lily Potter blossomed from the end of Voldemort\\'s wand, fell to the ground, and straightened like her husband. She walked close to Harry, looking down at him, and she spoke in the same distant, echoing voice as the others, but quietly, so that Voldemort, his face now livid with fear as his victims prowled around him, could not hear. . ..\\n\\n\"When the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments . . . but we will give you time. . . you must get to the Portkey, it will return you to Hogwarts ... do you understand, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" Harry gasped, fighting now to keep a hold on his wand, which was slipping and sliding beneath his fingers.\\n\\n\"Harry . . .\" whispered the figure of Cedric, \"take my body back, will you? Take my body back to my parents, ...\"\\n\\n\"I will,\" said Harry, his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand.\\n\\n\"Do it now,\" whispered his father\\'s voice, \"be ready to run . . . do it now. ...\"\\n\\n\"NOW!\" Harry yelled; he didn\\'t think he could have held on for another moment anyway � he pulled his wand upward with an almighty wrench, and the golden thread broke; the cage of light vanished, the phoenix song died � but the shadowy figures of Voldemort\\'s victims did not disappear � they were closing in upon Voldemort, shielding Harry from his gaze � And Harry ran as he had never run in his life, knocking two stunned Death Eaters aside as he passed; he zigzagged behind headstones, feeling their curses following him, hearing them hit the headstones � he was dodging curses and graves, pelting toward Cedric\\'s body, no longer aware of the pain in his leg, his whole being concentrated on what he had to do � \"Stun him!\" he heard Voldemort scream.\\n\\nTen feet from Cedric, Harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it. Gripping his wand more tightly, he dashed out from behind the angel � \"Impedimenta!\" he bellowed, pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the Death Eaters running at him.\\n\\nFrom a muffled yell, he thought he had stopped at least one of them, but there was no time to stop and look; he jumped over the cup and dived as he heard more\\n\\nwand blasts behind him; more jets of light flew over his head as he fell, stretching out his hand to grab Cedric\\'s arm...\\n\\n\"Stand aside! I will kill him! He is mine!\" shrieked Voldemort. Harry\\'s hand had closed on Cedric\\'s wrist; one tombstone stood between him and Voldemort, but Cedric was too heavy to carry, and the cup was out of reach � Voldemort\\'s red eyes flamed in the darkness. Harry saw his mouth curl into a smile, saw him raise his wand.\\n\\n\"Accio!\" Harry yelled, pointing his wand at the Triwizard Cup. It flew into the air and soared toward him. Harry caught it by the handle � He heard Voldemort s scream of fury at the same moment that he felt the jerk behind his navel that meant the Portkey had worked � it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and color, and Cedric along with him. . . . They were going back.\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY�FIVE � VERITASERUM\\n\\nHarry felt himself slam flat into the ground; his face was pressed into grass; the smell of it filled his nostrils. He had closed his eyes while the Portkey transported him, and he kept them closed now. He did not move. All the breath seemed to have been knocked out of him; his head was swimming so badly he felt as though the ground beneath him were swaying like the deck of a ship. To hold himself steady, he tightened his hold on the two things he was still clutching: the smooth, cold handle of the Triwizard Cup and Cedric\\'s body. He felt as though he would slide away into the blackness gathering at the edges of his brain if he let go of either of them. Shock and exhaustion kept him on the ground, breathing in the smell of the grass, waiting . . . waiting for someone to do something . . . something to happen . . . and all the while, his scar burned dully on his forehead. . . .\\n\\nA torrent of sound deafened and confused him; there were voices everywhere, footsteps, screams. ... He remained where he was, his face screwed up against the noise, as though it were a nightmare that would pass. . . .\\n\\nThen a pair of hands seized him roughly and turned him over.\\n\\n\"Harry! Harry!\"\\n\\nHe opened his eyes.\\n\\nHe was looking up at the starry sky, and Albus Dumbledore was crouched over him. The dark shadows of a crowd of people pressed in around them, pushing nearer; Harry felt the ground beneath his head reverberating with their footsteps.\\n\\nHe had come back to the edge of the maze. He could see the stands rising above him, the shapes of people moving in them, the stars above.\\n\\nHarry let go of the cup, but he clutched Cedric to him even more tightly. He raised his free hand and seized Dumbledore\\'s wrist, while Dumbledore\\'s face swam in and out of focus.\\n\\n\"He\\'s back,\" Harry whispered. \"He\\'s back. Voldemort.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s going on? What\\'s happened?\"\\n\\nThe face of Cornelius Fudge appeared upside down over Harry; it looked white, appalled.\\n\\n\"My God � Diggory!\" it whispered. \"Dumbledore � he\\'s dead!\"\\n\\nThe words were repeated, the shadowy figures pressing in on them gasped it to those around them . . . and then others shouted it � screeched it � into the night � \"He\\'s dead!\" \"He\\'s dead!\" \"Cedric Diggory! Dead!\"\\n\\n\"Harry, let go of him,\" he heard Fudge\\'s voice say, and he felt fingers trying to pry him from Cedric\\'s limp body, but Harry wouldn\\'t let him go. Then Dumbledore\\'s face, which was still blurred and misted, came closer.\\n\\n\"Harry, you can\\'t help him now. It\\'s over. Let go.\"\\n\\n\"He wanted me to bring him back,\" Harry muttered � it seemed important to explain this. \"He wanted me to bring him back to his parents. ...\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right. Harry . . . just let go now. . . .\"\\n\\nDumbledore bent down, and with extraordinary strength for a man so old and thin, raised Harry from the ground and set �him on his feet. Harry swayed. His head was pounding. His injured leg would no longer support his weight. The crowd around them jostled, fighting to get closer, pressing darkly in on him � \"What\\'s happened?\" \"What\\'s wrong with him?\" \"Diggorys dead!\"\\n\\n\"He\\'ll need to go to the hospital wing!\" Fudge was saying loudly. \"He\\'s ill, he\\'s injured � Dumbledore, Diggory\\'s parents, they\\'re here, they\\'re in the stands. ...\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll take Harry, Dumbledore, I\\'ll take him �\"\\n\\n\"No, I would prefer�\"\\n\\n\"Dumbledore, Amos Diggorys running . . . he\\'s coming over. . . . Don\\'t you think you should tell him � before he sees � ?\"\\n\\n\"Harry, stay here �\"\\n\\nGirls were screaming, sobbing hysterically.... The scene flickered oddly before Harry\\'s eyes. . . .\\n\\n\"Its all right, son, I\\'ve got you . . . come on ... hospital wing . . .\"\\n\\n\"Dumbledore said stay,\" said Harry thickly, the pounding in his scar making him feel as though he was about to throw up; his vision was blurring worse than ever.\\n\\n\"You need to lie down. . .. Come on now....\"\\n\\nSomeone larger and stronger than he was was half pulling, half carrying him through the frightened crowd. Harry heard people gasping, screaming, and shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them, taking him back to the castle. Across the lawn, past the lake and the Durmstrang ship, Harry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk.\\n\\n\"What happened. Harry?\" the man asked at last as he lifted Harry up the stone steps. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. It was Mad�Eye Moody.\\n\\n\"Cup was a Portkey,\" said Harry as they crossed the entrance hall. \"Took me and Cedric to a graveyard . . . and Voldemort was there . . . Lord Voldemort...\"\\n\\nClunk. Clunk. Clunk. Up the marble stairs . . .\\n\\n\"The Dark Lord was there? What happened then?\"\\n\\n\"Killed Cedric . . . they killed Cedric. . . .\"\\n\\n\"And then?\"\\n\\nClunk. Clunk. Clunk. Along the corridor . . .\\n\\n\"Made a potion . . . got his body back. . . .\"\\n\\n\"The Dark Lord got his body back? He\\'s returned?\"\\n\\n\"And the Death Eaters came . . . and then we dueled. ...\"\\n\\n\"You dueled with the Dark Lord?\"\\n\\n\"Got away . . . my wand . . . did something funny. ... I saw my mum and dad . . .\\n\\nthey came out of his wand. ...\"\\n\\n\"In here. Harry ... in here, and sit down. . . . You\\'ll be all right now . . . drink this.\\n\\n...\"\\n\\nHarry heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup being pushed into his hands.\\n\\n\"Drink it... you\\'ll feel better . . . come on, now. Harry, I need to know exactly what happened. ...\"\\n\\nMoody helped tip the stuff down Harrys throat; he coughed, a peppery taste burning his throat. Moody\\'s office came into sharper focus, and so did Moody himself. ... He looked as white as Fudge had looked, and both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon Harry\\'s face.\\n\\n\"Voldemort\\'s back, Harry? You\\'re sure he\\'s back? How did he do it?\"\\n\\n\"He took stuff from his father\\'s grave, and from Wormtail, and me,\" said Harry.\\n\\nHis head felt clearer; his scar wasn\\'t hurting so badly; he could now see Moodys face distinctly, even though the office was dark. He could still hear screaming and shouting from the distant Quidditch field.\\n\\n\"What did the Dark Lord take from you?\" said Moody.\\n\\n\"Blood,\" said Harry, raising his arm. His sleeve was ripped where Wormtail\\'s dagger had torn it.\\n\\nMoody let out his breath in a long, low hiss.\\n\\n\"And the Death Eaters? They returned?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"Loads of them . . .\"\\n\\n\"How did he treat them?\" Moody asked quietly. \"Did he forgive them?\"\\n\\nBut Harry had suddenly remembered. He should have told Dumbledore, he should have said it straightaway � \"There\\'s a Death Eater at Hogwarts! There\\'s a Death Eater here � they put my name in the Goblet of Fire, they made sure I got through to the end �\"\\n\\nHarry tried to get up, but Moody pushed him back down.\\n\\n\"I know who the Death Eater is,\" he said quietly.\\n\\n\"Karkaroff?\" said Harry wildly. \"Where is he? Have you got him? Is he locked up?\"\\n\\n\"Karkaroff?\" said Moody with an odd laugh. \"Karkaroff fled tonight, when he felt the Dark Mark burn upon his arm. He betrayed too many faithful supporters of the Dark Lord to wish to meet them . . . but I doubt he will get far. The Dark Lord has ways of tracking his enemies.\"\\n\\n\"Karkaroff\\'s gone? He ran away? But then � he didn\\'t put my name in the goblet?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Moody slowly. \"No, he didn\\'t. It was I who did that.\"\\n\\nHarry heard, but didn\\'t believe.\\n\\n\"No, you didn\\'t,\" he said. \"You didn\\'t do that. . . you can\\'t have done...\"\\n\\n\"I assure you I did,\" said Moody, and his magical eye swung around and fixed upon the door, and Harry knew he was making sure that there was no one outside it. At the same time, Moody drew out his wand and pointed it at Harry.\\n\\n\"He forgave them, then?\" he said. \"The Death Eaters who went free? The ones who escaped Azkaban?\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry.\\n\\nHe was looking at the wand Moody was pointing at him. This was a bad joke, it had to be.\\n\\n\"I asked you,\" said Moody quietly, \"whether he forgave the scum who never even went to look for him. Those treacherous cowards who wouldn\\'t even brave Azkaban for him. The faithless, worthless bits of filth who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the Quidditch World Cup, but fled at the sight of the Dark Mark when I fired it into the sky.\"\\n\\n\"You fired . . . What are you talking about. . . ?\"\\n\\n\"I told you. Harry ... I told you. If there\\'s one thing I hate more than any other, it\\'s a Death Eater who walked free. They turned their backs on my master when he needed them most. I expected him to punish them. I expected him to torture them.\\n\\nTell me he\\n\\nhurt them, Harry. . . .\" Moody\\'s face was suddenly lit with an insane smile. \"Tell me he told them that I, I alone remained faithful... prepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above all... you\"\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t... it � it can\\'t be you. ...\"\\n\\n\"Who put your name in the Goblet of Fire, under the name of a different school? I did. Who frightened off every person I thought might try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tournament? I did. Who nudged Hagrid into showing you the dragons? I did. Who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon? I did\"\\n\\nMoody\\'s magical eye had now left the door. It was fixed upon Harry. His lopsided mouth leered more widely than ever.\\n\\n\"It hasn\\'t been easy, Harry, guiding you through these tasks without arousing suspicion. I have had to use every ounce of cunning I possess, so that my hand would not be detectable in your success. Dumbledore would have been very suspicious if you had managed everything too easily. As long as you got into that maze, preferably with a decent head start � then, I knew, I would have a chance of getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way clear. But I also had to contend with your stupidity. The second task . . . that was when I was most afraid we would fail. I was keeping watch on you, Potter. I knew you hadn\\'t worked out the egg\\'s clue, so I had to give you another hint �\"\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t,\" Harry said hoarsely. \"Cedric gave me the clue �\"\\n\\n\"Who told Cedric to open it underwater? I did. I trusted that he would pass the information on to you. Decent people are so easy to manipulate, Potter. I was sure Cedric would want to repay you for telling him about the dragons, and so he did.\\n\\nBut even then, Potter, even then you seemed likely to fail. I was watching all the time ... all those hours in the library. Didn\\'t you realize that the book you needed was in your dormitory all along? I planted it there early on, I gave it to the Longbottom boy, don\\'t you remember? Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean. It would have told you all you needed to know about gillyweed. I expected you to ask everyone and anyone you could for help. Longbottom would have told you in an instant. But you did not. . . you did not. . . . You have a streak of pride and independence that might have ruined all.\\n\\n\"So what could I do? Feed you information from another innocent source. You told me at the Yule Ball a house�elf called Dobby had given you a Christmas present. I called the elf to the staffroom to collect some robes for cleaning. I staged a loud conversation with Professor McGonagall about the hostages who had been taken, and whether Potter would think to use gillyweed. And your little elf friend ran straight to Snape\\'s office and then hurried to find you...\"\\n\\nMoodys wand was still pointing directly at Harry\\'s heart. Over his shoulder, foggy\\n\\nshapes were moving in the Foe�Glass on the wall.\\n\\n\"You were so long in that lake, Potter, I thought you had drowned. But luckily, Dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility, and marked you high for it. I breathed again.\\n\\n\"You had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight, of course,\" said Moody. \"I was patrolling around it, able to see through the outer hedges, able to curse many obstacles out of your way. I Stunned Fleur Delacour as she passed. I put the Imperius Curse on Krum, so that he would finish Diggory and leave your path to the cup clear.\"\\n\\nHarry stared at Moody. He just didn\\'t see how this could be. ... Dumbledore\\'s friend, the famous Auror. . . the one who had caught so many Death Eaters ... It made no sense ... no sense at all. ...\\n\\nThe foggy shapes in the Foe�Glass were sharpening, had become more distinct.\\n\\nHarry could see the outlines of three people over Moody\\'s shoulder, moving closer and closer. But Moody wasn\\'t watching them. His magical eye was upon Harry.\\n\\n\"The Dark Lord didn\\'t manage to kill you. Potter, and he so wanted to,\" whispered Moody. \"Imagine how he will reward me when he finds I have done it for him. I gave you to him � the thing he needed above all to regenerate � and then I killed you for him. I will be honored beyond all other Death Eaters. I will be his dearest, his closest supporter . . . closer than a son. ...\"\\n\\nMoody\\'s normal eye was bulging, the magical eye fixed upon Harry. The door was barred, and Harry knew he would never reach his own wand in time. . . .\\n\\n\"The Dark Lord and I,\" said Moody, and he looked completely insane now, towering over Harry, leering down at him, \"have much in common. Both of us, for instance, had very disappointing fathers . . . very disappointing indeed. Both of us suffered the indignity, Harry, of being named after those fathers. And both of us had the pleasure . . . the very great pleasure ... of killing our fathers to ensure the continued rise of the Dark Order!\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re mad,\" Harry said � he couldn\\'t stop himself� \"you\\'re mad!\"\\n\\n\"Mad, am I?\" said Moody, his voice rising uncontrollably. \"We\\'ll see! We\\'ll see who\\'s mad, now that the Dark Lord has returned, with me at his side! He is back, Harry Potter, you did not conquer him � and now � I conquer you!\"\\n\\nMoody raised his wand, he opened his mouth; Harry plunged his own hand into his robes � \"Stupefy!\" There was a blinding flash of red light, and with a great splintering and crashing, the door of Moody\\'s office was blasted apart � Moody was thrown backward onto the office floor. Harry, still staring at the place where Moody\\'s face had been, saw Albus Dumbledore, Professor Snape, and\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall looking back at him out of the Foe�Glass. He looked around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway, Dumbledore in front, his wand outstretched.\\n\\nAt that moment, Harry fully understood for the first time why people said Dumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort had ever feared. The look upon Dumbledore\\'s face as he stared down at the unconscious form of Mad�Eye Moody was more terrible than Harry could have ever imagined. There was no benign smile upon Dumbledore\\'s face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles. There was cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of power radiated from Dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heat.\\n\\nHe stepped into the office, placed a foot underneath Moodys unconscious body, and kicked him over onto his back, so that his face was visible. Snape followed him, looking into the Foe�Glass, where his own face was still visible, glaring into the room. Professor McGonagall went straight to Harry.\\n\\n\"Come along, Potter,\" she whispered. The thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry. \"Come along . . . hospital wing ...\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Dumbledore sharply.\\n\\n\"Dumbledore, he ought to � look at him � he\\'s been through enough tonight �\"\\n\\n\"He will stay, Minerva, because he needs to understand,\" said Dumbledore curtly.\\n\\n\"Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery. He needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight, and why,\"\\n\\n\"Moody,\" Harry said. He was still in a state of complete disbelief. \"How can it have been Moody?\"\\n\\n\"This is not Alastor Moody,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"You have never known Alastor Moody. The real Moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight. The moment he took you, I knew � and I followed.\"\\n\\nDumbledore bent down over Moody\\'s limp form and put a hand inside his robes.\\n\\nHe pulled out Moody\\'s hip flask and a set of keys on a ring. Then he turned to Professors McGonagall and Snape.\\n\\n\"Severus, please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion you possess, and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the house�elf called Winky. Minerva, kindly go down to Hagrid\\'s house, where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch. Take the dog up to my office, tell him I will be with him shortly, then come back here.\"\\n\\nIf either Snape or McGonagall found these instructions peculiar, they hid their confusion. Both turned at once and left the office. Dumbledore walked over to the trunk with seven locks, fitted the first key in the lock, and opened it. It contained a\\n\\nmass of spell�books. Dumbledore closed the trunk, placed a second key in the second lock, and opened the trunk again. The spellbooks had vanished; this time it contained an assortment of broken Sneako�scopes, some parchment and quills, and what looked like a silvery Invisibility Cloak. Harry watched, astounded, as Dumbledore placed the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth keys in their respective locks, reopening the trunk each time, and revealing different contents each time. Then he placed the seventh key in the lock, threw open the lid, and Harry let out a cry of amazement.\\n\\nHe was looking down into a kind of pit, an underground room, and lying on the floor some ten feet below, apparently fast asleep, thin and starved in appearance, was the real Mad�Eye Moody. His wooden leg was gone, the socket that should have held the magical eye looked empty beneath its lid, and chunks of his grizzled hair were missing. Harry stared, thunderstruck, between the sleeping Moody in the trunk and the unconscious Moody lying on the floor of the office.\\n\\nDumbledore climbed into the trunk, lowered himself, and fell lightly onto the floor beside the sleeping Moody. He bent over him.\\n\\n\"Stunned � controlled by the Imperius Curse � very weak,\" he said. \"Of course, they would have needed to keep him alive. Harry, throw down the imposter\\'s cloak � he\\'s freezing. Madam Pomfrey will need to see him, but he seems in no immediate danger.\"\\n\\nHarry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody in the cloak, tucked it around him, and clambered out of the trunk again. Then he picked up the hip flask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over. A thick glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor.\\n\\n\"Polyjuice Potion, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"You see the simplicity of it, and the brilliance. For Moody never does drink except from his hip flask, he\\'s well known for it. The imposter needed, of course, to keep the real Moody close by, so that he could continue making the potion. You see his hair ...\" Dumbledore looked down on the Moody in the trunk. \"The imposter has been cutting it off all year, see where it is uneven? But I think, in the excitement of tonight, our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequendy as he should have done ... on the hour . . . every hour. . . . We shall see.\"\\n\\nDumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it, his eyes fixed upon the unconscious Moody on the floor. Harry stared at him too. Minutes passed in silence... .\\n\\nThen, before Harry\\'s very eyes, the face of the man on the floor began to change.\\n\\nThe scars were disappearing, the skin was becoming smooth; the mangled nose became whole and started to shrink. The long mane of grizzled gray hair was withdrawing into the scalp and turning the color of straw. Suddenly, with a loud clunk, the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place; next moment, the magical eyeball had popped out of the man\\'s face as a real eye replaced it; it\\n\\nrolled away across the floor and continued to swivel in every direction.\\n\\nHarry saw a man lying before him, pale�skinned, slightly freckled, with a mop of fair hair. He knew who he was. He had seen him in Dumbledore\\'s Pensieve, had watched him being led away from court by the dementors, trying to convince Mr.\\n\\nCrouch that he was innocent. . . but he was lined around the eyes now and looked much older. . . .\\n\\nThere were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor. Snape had returned with Winky at his heels. Professor McGonagall was right behind them.\\n\\n\"Crouch!\" Snape said, stopping dead in the doorway. \"Barty Crouch!\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens,\" said Professor McGonagall, stopping dead and staring down at the man on the floor.\\n\\nFilthy, disheveled, Winky peered around Snape\\'s legs. Her mouth opened wide and she let out a piercing shriek.\\n\\n\"Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?\"\\n\\nShe flung herself forward onto the young man\\'s chest.\\n\\n\"You is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed Master\\'s son!\"\\n\\n\"He is simply Stunned, Winky,\" said Dumbledore. \"Step aside, please. Severus, you have the potion?\"\\n\\nSnape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid: the Veritaserum with which he had threatened Harry in class. Dumbledore got up, bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a sitting position against the wall beneath the Foe�Glass, in which the reflections of Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall were still glaring down upon them all. Winky remained on her knees, trembling, her hands over her face. Dumbledore forced the mans mouth open and poured three drops inside it. Then he pointed his wand at the mans chest and said, \"Ennervate.\"\\n\\nCrouch\\'s son opened his eyes. His face was slack, his gaze unfocused.\\n\\nDumbledore knelt before him, so that their faces were level.\\n\\n\"Can you hear me?\" Dumbledore asked quietly.\\n\\nThe man\\'s eyelids flickered.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he muttered.\\n\\n\"I would like you to tell us,\" said Dumbledore softly, \"how you came to be here.\\n\\nHow did you escape from Azkaban?\"\\n\\nCrouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat, expressionless voice.\\n\\n\"My mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to her. He loved her as he had never loved me. He agreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a draft of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my mother\\'s hairs. She took a draft of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my hairs. We took on each other\\'s appearance.\"\\n\\nWinky was shaking her head, trembling.\\n\\n\"Say no more. Master Barty, say no more, you is getting your father into trouble!\"\\n\\nBut Crouch took another deep breath and continued in the same flat voice.\\n\\n\"The dementors are blind. They sensed one healthy, one dying person entering Azkaban. They sensed one healthy, one dying person leaving it. My father smuggled me out, disguised as my mother, in case any prisoners were watching through their doors.\\n\\n\"My mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban. She was careful to drink Polyjuice Potion until the end. She was buried under my name and bearing my appearance. Everyone believed her to be me.\"\\n\\nThe man\\'s eyelids flickered.\\n\\n\"And what did your father do with you, when he had got you home?\" said Dumbledore quietly.\\n\\n\"Staged my mother\\'s death. A quiet, private funeral. That grave is empty. The house�elf nursed me back to health. Then I had to be concealed. I had to be controlled. My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me. When I had recovered my strength, I thought only of finding my master . . . of returning to his service.\"\\n\\n\"How did your father subdue you?\" said Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"The Imperius Curse,\" Moody said. \"I was under my fathers control. I was forced to wear an Invisibility Cloak day and night. I was always with the house�elf. She was my keeper and caretaker. She pitied me. She persuaded my father to give me occasional treats. Rewards for my good behavior.\"\\n\\n\"Master Barty, Master Barty,\" sobbed Winky through her hands. \"You isn\\'t ought to tell them, we is getting in trouble. ...\"\\n\\n\"Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive?\" said Dumbledore softly.\\n\\n\"Did anyone know except your father and the house�elf?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Crouch, his eyelids flickering again. \"A witch in my father\\'s office.\\n\\nBertha Jorkins. She came to the house with papers for my father s signature. He was not at home. Winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen, to me. But Bertha Jorkins heard Winky talking to me. She came to investigate. She heard enough to guess who was hiding under the Invisibility Cloak. My father arrived\\n\\nhome. She confronted him. He put a very powerful Memory Charm on her to make her forget what she\\'d found out. Too powerful. He said it damaged her memory permanently.\"\\n\\n\"Why is she coming to nose into my masters private business?\" sobbed Winky.\\n\\n\"Why isn\\'t she leaving us be?\"\\n\\n\"Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup,\" said Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"Winky talked my father into it,\" said Crouch, still in the same monotonous voice.\\n\\n\"She spent months persuading him. I had not left the house for years. I had loved Quidditch. Let him go, she said. He will be in his Invisibility Cloak. He can watch.\\n\\nLet him smell fresh air for once. She said my mother would have wanted it. She told my father that my mother had died to give me freedom. She had not saved me for a life of imprisonment. He agreed in the end.\\n\\n\"It was carefully planned. My father led me and Winky up to the Top Box early in the day. Winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father. I was to sit there, invisible. When everyone had left the box, we would emerge. Winky would appear to be alone. Nobody would ever know.\\n\\n\"But Winky didn\\'t know that I was growing stronger. I was starting to fight my father\\'s Imperius Curse. There were times when I was almost myself again. There were brief periods when I seemed outside his control. It happened, there, in the Top Box. It was like waking from a deep sleep. I found myself out in public, in the middle of the match, and I saw, in front of me, a wand sticking out of a boys pocket. I had not been allowed a wand since before Azkaban. I stole it. Winky didn\\'t know. Winky is frightened of heights. She had her face hidden.\"\\n\\n\"Master Barty, you bad boy!\" whispered Winky, tears trickling between her fingers.\\n\\n\"So you took the wand,\" said Dumbledore, \"and what did you do with it?\"\\n\\n\"We went back to the tent,\" said Crouch. \"Then we heard them. We heard the Death Eaters. The ones who had never been to Azkaban. The ones who had never suffered for my master. They had turned their backs on him. They were not enslaved, as I was. They were free to seek him, but they did not. They were merely making sport of Muggles. The sound of their voices awoke me. My mind was clearer than it had been in years. I was angry. I had the wand.\\n\\nI wanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master. My father had left the tent; he had gone to free the Muggles. Winky was afraid to see me so angry. She used her own brand of magic to bind me to her. She pulled me from the tent, pulled me into the forest, away from the Death Eaters. I tried to hold her back. I wanted to return to the campsite. I wanted to show those Death Eaters what loyalty to the Dark Lord meant, and to punish them for their lack of it. I used the stolen wand to cast the Dark Mark into the sky.\\n\\n\"Ministry wizards arrived. They shot Stunning Spells everywhere. One of the spells came through the trees where Winky and I stood. The bond connecting us was broken. We were both Stunned.\\n\\n\"When Winky was discovered, my father knew I must be nearby. He searched the bushes where she had been found and felt me lying there. He waited until the other Ministry members had left the forest. He put me back under the Imperius Curse and took me home. He dismissed Winky. She had failed him. She had let me acquire a wand. She had almost let me escape.\"\\n\\nWinky let out a wail of despair.\\n\\n\"Now it was just Father and I, alone in the house. And then . . . and then . . .\"\\n\\nCrouch\\'s head rolled on his neck, and an insane grin spread across his face. \"My master came for me.\\n\\n\"He arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant Wormtail. My master had found out that I was still alive. He had captured Bertha Jorkins in Albania. He had tortured her. She told him a great deal. She told him about the Triwizard Tournament. She told him the old Auror, Moody, was going to teach at Hogwarts. He tortured her until he broke through the Memory Charm my father had placed upon her. She told him I had escaped from Azkaban. She told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from seeking my master. And so my master knew that I was still his faithful servant � perhaps the most faithful of all.\\n\\nMy master conceived a plan, based upon the information Bertha had given him.\\n\\nHe needed me. He arrived at our house near midnight. My father answered the door.\"\\n\\nThe smile spread wider over Crouch\\'s face, as though recalling the sweetest memory of his life. Winky\\'s petrified brown eyes were visible through her fingers.\\n\\nShe seemed too appalled to speak.\\n\\n\"It was very quick. My father was placed under the Imperius Curse by my master.\\n\\nNow my father was the one imprisoned, controlled. My master forced him to go about his business as usual, to act as though nothing was wrong. And I was released. I awoke. I was myself again, alive as I hadn\\'t been in years.\\n\\n\"And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do?\" said Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything for him. I was ready. It was my dream, my greatest ambition, to serve him, to prove myself to him. He told me he needed to place a faithful servant at Hogwarts. A servant who would guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without appearing to do so. A servant who would watch over Harry Potter. Ensure he reached the Triwizard Cup.\\n\\nTurn the cup into a Portkey, which would take the first person to touch it to my master. But first �\"\\n\\n\"You needed Alastor Moody,\" said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were blazing, though his voice remained calm.\\n\\n\"Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand. We journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle. There was a commotion. We managed to subdue him just in time. Forced him into a compartment of his own magical trunk. Took some of his hair and added it to the potion. I drank it; I became Moody\\'s double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed up Moody\\'s clothes and Dark detectors, put them in the trunk with Moody, and set off for Hogwarts. I kept him alive, under the Imperius Curse. I wanted to be able to question him. To find out about his past, learn his habits, so that I could fool even Dumbledore. I also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice Potion. The other ingredients were easy. I stole boom�slang skin from the dungeons. When the Potions master found me in his office, I said I was under orders to search it.\"\\n\\n\"And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody?\" said Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"Wormtail returned to care for my master, in my father\\'s house, and to keep watch over my father.\"\\n\\n\"But your father escaped,\" said Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done. There were periods when he knew what was happening. My master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the house. He forced him to send letters to the Ministry instead. He made him write and say he was ill. But Wormtail neglected his duty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped. My master guessed that he was heading for Hogwarts. My father was going to tell Dumbledore everything, to confess. He was going to admit that he had smuggled me from Azkaban.\\n\\n\"My master sent me word of my father\\'s escape. He told me to stop him at all costs. So I waited and watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry Potter. The map that had almost ruined everything.\"\\n\\n\"Map?\" said Dumbledore quickly. \"What map is this?\"\\n\\n\"Potter\\'s map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape\\'s office one night. He thought I was my father. We have the same first name. I took the map from Potter that night.\\n\\nI told him my father hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my father was after Snape.\\n\\n\"For a week I waited for my father to arrive at Hogwarts. At last, one evening, the map showed my father entering the grounds. I pulled on my Invisibility Cloak and went down to meet him. He was walking around the edge of the forest. Then Potter came, and Krum. I waited. I could not hurt Potter; my master needed him.\\n\\nPotter ran to get Dumbledore. I Stunned Krum. I killed my father.\"\\n\\n\"Noooo!\" wailed Winky. \"Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you saying?\"\\n\\n\"You killed your father,\" Dumbledore said, in the same soft voice. \"What did you do with the body?\"\\n\\n\"Carried it into the forest. Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak. I had the map with me. I watched Potter run into the castle. He met Snape. Dumbledore joined them. I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore out of the castle. I walked back out of the forest, doubled around behind them, went to meet them. I told Dumbledore Snape had told me where to come.\\n\\n\"Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father. I went back to my father\\'s body. Watched the map. When everyone was gone, I Transfigured my father\\'s body. He became a bone ... I buried it, while wearing the Invisibility Cloak, in the freshly dug earth in front of Hagrid\\'s cabin.\"\\n\\nThere was complete silence now, except for Winky\\'s continued sobs. Then Dumbledore said, \"And tonight. . .\"\\n\\n\"I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner,\" whispered Barty Crouch. \"Turned it into a Portkey. My master\\'s plan worked. He is returned to power and I will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards.\"\\n\\nThe insane smile lit his features once more, and his head drooped onto his shoulder as Winky wailed and sobbed at his side.\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY�SIX � THE PARTING OF THE WAYS\\n\\nDumbledore stood up. He stared down at Barty Crouch for a moment with disgust on his face. Then he raised his wand once more and ropes flew out of it, ropes that twisted themselves around Barty Crouch, binding him tightly. He turned to Professor McGonagall.\\n\\n\"Minerva, could I ask you to stand guard here while I take Harry upstairs?\"\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said Professor McGonagall. She looked slightly nauseous, as though she had just watched someone being sick. However, when she drew out her wand and pointed it at Barty Crouch, her hand was quite steady.\\n\\n\"Severus\" � Dumbledore turned to Snape � \"please tell Madam Pomfrey to come down here; we need to get Alastor Moody into the hospital wing. Then go down into the grounds, find Cornelius Fudge, and bring him up to this office. He will undoubtedly want to question Crouch himself. Tell him I will be in the hospital wing in half an hour\\'s time if he needs me.\"\\n\\nSnape nodded silently and swept out of the room.\\n\\n\"Harry?\" Dumbledore said gently.\\n\\nHarry got up and swayed again; the pain in his leg, which he had not noticed all the time he had been listening to Crouch, now returned in full measure. He also realized that he was shaking. Dumbledore gripped his arm and helped him out into the dark corridor.\\n\\n\"I want you to come up to my office first. Harry,\" he said quiedy as they headed up the passageway. \"Sirius is waiting for us there.\"\\n\\nHarry nodded. A kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were upon him, but he did not care; he was even glad of it. He didn\\'t want to have to think about anything that had happened since he had first touched the Triwizard Cup. He didn\\'t want to have to examine the memories, fresh and sharp as photographs, which kept flashing across his mind. Mad�Eye Moody, inside the trunk. Wormtail, slumped on the ground, cradling his stump of an arm. Voldemort, rising from the steaming cauldron. Cedric. . . dead . . . Cedric, asking to be returned to his parents.\\n\\n. . .\\n\\n\"Professor,\" Harry mumbled, \"where are Mr. and Mrs. Diggory?\"\\n\\n\"They are with Professor Sprout,\" said Dumbledore. His voice, which had been so calm throughout the interrogation of Barty Crouch, shook very slightly for the first time. \"She was Head of Cedric\\'s house, and knew him best.\"\\n\\nThey had reached the stone gargoyle. Dumbledore gave the password, it sprang\\n\\naside, and he and Harry went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door.\\n\\nDumbledore pushed it open. Sirius was standing there. His face was white and gaunt as it had been when he had escaped Azkaban. In one swift moment, he had crossed the room.\\n\\n\"Harry, are you all right? I knew it � I knew something like this � what happened?\"\\n\\nHis hands shook as he helped Harry into a chair in front of the desk.\\n\\n\"What happened?\" he asked more urgently.\\n\\nDumbledore began to tell Sirius everything Barty Crouch had said. Harry was only half listening. So tired every bone in his body was aching, he wanted nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours and hours, until he fell asleep and didn\\'t have to think or feel anymore.\\n\\nThere was a soft rush of wings. Fawkes the phoenix had left his perch, flown across the office, and landed on Harry\\'s knee.\\n\\n\"\\'Lo, Fawkes,\" said Harry quietly. He stroked the phoenix\\'s beautiful scarlet�and� gold plumage. Fawkes blinked peacefully up at him. There was something comforting about his warm weight.\\n\\nDumbledore stopped talking. He sat down opposite Harry, behind his desk. He was looking at Harry, who avoided his eyes. Dumbledore was going to question him. He was going to make Harry relive everything.\\n\\n\"I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze. Harry,\"\\n\\nsaid Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"We can leave that till morning, can\\'t we, Dumbledore?\" said Sirius harshly. He had put a hand on Harrys shoulder. \"Let him have a sleep. Let him rest.\"\\n\\nHarry felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius, but Dumbledore took no notice of Sirius\\'s words. He leaned forward toward Harry.\\n\\nVery unwillingly, Harry raised his head and looked into those blue eyes.\\n\\n\"If I thought I could help you,\" Dumbledore said gently, \"by putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight, I would do it. But I know better.\\n\\nNumbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it. You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you. I ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time. I ask you to tell us what happened.\"\\n\\nThe phoenix let out one soft, quavering note. It shivered in the air, and Harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach, warming him, and strengthening him.\\n\\nHe took a deep breath and began to tell them. As he spoke, visions of everything\\n\\nthat had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes; he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived Voldemort; he saw the Death Eaters Apparating between the graves around them; he saw Cedric\\'s body, lying on the ground beside the cup.\\n\\nOnce or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to say something, his hand still tight on Harry\\'s shoulder, but Dumbledore raised his hand to stop him, and Harry was glad of this, because it was easier to keep going now he had started. It was even a relief; he felt almost as though something poisonous were being extracted from him. It was costing him every bit of determination he had to keep talking, yet he sensed that once he had finished, he would feel better.\\n\\nWhen Harry told of Wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger, however, Sirius let out a vehement exclamation and Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry started. Dumbledore walked around the desk and told Harry to stretch out his arm.\\n\\nHarry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them.\\n\\n\"He said my blood would make him stronger than if he\\'d used someone else\\'s,\"\\n\\nHarry told Dumbledore. \"He said the protection my � my mother left in me � he\\'d have it too. And he was right � he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face.\"\\n\\nFor a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore\\'s eyes. But next second. Harry was sure he had imagined it, for when Dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk, he looked as old and weary as Harry had ever seen him.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" he said, sitting down again. \"Voldemort has overcome that particular barrier. Harry, continue, please.\"\\n\\nHarry went on; he explained how Voldemort had emerged from the cauldron, and told them all he could remember of Voldemort\\'s speech to the Death Eaters. Then he told how Voldemort had untied him, returned his wand to him, and prepared to duel.\\n\\nBut when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and Voldemort\\'s wands, he found his throat obstructed. He tried to keep talking, but the memories of what had come out of Voldemort\\'s wand were flooding into his mind. He could see Cedric emerging, see the old man, Bertha Jorkins ... his father . . . his mother . . .\\n\\nHe was glad when Sirius broke the silence.\\n\\n\"The wands connected?\" he said, looking from Harry to Dumbledore. \"Why?\"\\n\\nHarry looked up at Dumbledore again, on whose face there was an arrested look.\\n\\n\"Priori Incantatem,\" he muttered.\\n\\nHis eyes gazed into Harry\\'s and it was almost as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between them.\\n\\n\"The Reverse Spell effect?\" said Sirius sharply.\\n\\n\"Exactly,\" said Dumbledore. \"Harry\\'s wand and Voldemorts wand share cores.\\n\\nEach of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix. This phoenix, in fact,\" he added, and he pointed at the scarlet�and�gold bird, perching peacefully on Harry\\'s knee.\\n\\n\"My wand\\'s feather came from Fawkes?\" Harry said, amazed.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"Mr. Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand, the moment you left his shop four years ago.\"\\n\\n\"So what happens when a wand meets its brother?\" said Sirius.\\n\\n\"They will not work properly against each other,\" said Dumbledore. \"If, however, the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle ... a very rare effect will take place. One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed � in reverse. The most recent first. . . and then those which preceded it. . . .\"\\n\\nHe looked interrogatively at Harry, and Harry nodded.\\n\\n\"Which means,\" said Dumbledore slowly, his eyes upon Harry\\'s face, \"that some form of Cedric must have reappeared.\"\\n\\nHarry nodded again.\\n\\n\"Diggory came back to life?\" said Sirius sharply.\\n\\n\"No spell can reawaken the dead,\" said Dumbledore heavily. \"All that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo. A shadow of the living Cedric would have emerged from the wand . . . am I correct, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"He spoke to me,\" Harry said. He was suddenly shaking again. \"The . . . the ghost Cedric, or whatever he was, spoke.\"\\n\\n\"An echo,\" said Dumbledore, \"which retained Cedric\\'s appearance and character. I am guessing other such forms appeared . . . less recent victims of Voldemort\\'s wand....\"\\n\\n\"An old man,\" Harry said, his throat still constricted. \"Bertha Jorkins. And . . .\"\\n\\n\"Your parents?\" said Dumbledore quietly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry.\\n\\nSirius\\'s grip on Harry\\'s shoulder was now so tight it was painful.\\n\\n\"The last murders the wand performed,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"In reverse order. More would have appeared, of course, had you maintained the connection.\\n\\nVery well, Harry, these echoes, these shadows . .. what did they do?\"\\n\\nHarry described how the figures that had emerged from the wand had prowled the edges of the golden web, how Voldemort had seemed to fear them, how the shadow of Harry\\'s mother had told him what to do, how Cedric\\'s had made its final request.\\n\\nAt this point. Harry found he could not continue. He looked around at Sirius and saw that he had his face in his hands.\\n\\nHarry suddenly became aware that Fawkes had left his knee. The phoenix had fluttered to the floor. It was resting its beautiful head against Harry\\'s injured leg, and thick, pearly tears were falling from its eyes onto the wound left by the spider.\\n\\nThe pain vanished. The skin mended. His leg was repaired.\\n\\n\"I will say it again,\" said Dumbledore as the phoenix rose into the air and resettled itself upon the perch beside the door. \"You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you tonight. Harry. You have shown bravery equal to those who died fighting Voldemort at the height of his powers. You have shouldered a grown wizard\\'s burden and found yourself equal to it � and you have now given us all we have a right to expect. You will come with me to the hospital wing. I do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight. A Sleeping Potion, and some peace . . . Sirius, would you like to stay with him?\"\\n\\nSirius nodded and stood up. He transformed back into the great black dog and walked with Harry and Dumbledore out of the office, accompanying them down a flight of stairs to the hospital wing.\\n\\nWhen Dumbledore pushed open the door. Harry saw Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione grouped around a harassed�looking Madam Pomfrey. They appeared to be demanding to know where Harry was and what had happened to him. All of them whipped around as Harry, Dumbledore, and the black dog entered, and Mrs.\\n\\nWeasley let out a kind of muffled scream.\\n\\n\"Harry! Oh Harry!\"\\n\\nShe started to hurry toward him, but Dumbledore moved between them.\\n\\n\"Molly,\" he said, holding up a hand, \"please listen to me for a moment. Harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight. He has just had to relive it for me. What he needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet. If he would like you all to stay with him,\" he added, looking around at Ron, Hermione, and Bill too, \"you may do so.\\n\\nBut I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer, and certainly not this evening.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weasley nodded. She was very white. She rounded on Ron, Hermione, and Bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed, \"Did you hear? He needs quiet!\"\\n\\n\"Headmaster,\" said Madam Pomfrey, staring at the great black dog that was Sirius,\\n\\n\"may I ask what � ?\"\\n\\n\"This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while,\" said Dumbledore simply. \"I assure you, he is extremely well trained. Harry � I will wait while you get into bed.\"\\n\\nHarry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to Dumbledore for asking the others not to question him. It wasn\\'t as though he didn\\'t want them there; but the thought of explaining it all over again, the idea of reliving it one more time, was more than he could stand.\\n\\n\"I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"I would like you to remain here tomorrow until I have spoken to the school.\" He left.\\n\\nAs Madam Pomfrey led Harry to a nearby bed, he caught sight of the real Moody lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the room. His wooden leg and magical eye were lying on the bedside table.\\n\\n\"Is he okay?\" Harry asked.\\n\\n\"He\\'ll be fine,\" said Madam Pomfrey, giving Harry some pajamas and pulling screens around him. He took off his robes, pulled on the pajamas, and got into bed.\\n\\nRon, Hermione, Bill, Mrs. Weasley, and the black dog came around the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him. Ron and Hermione were looking at him almost cautiously, as though scared of him.\\n\\n\"I\\'m all right,\" he told them. \"Just tired.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weasleys eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bed�covers unnecessarily.\\n\\nMadam Pomfrey, who had bustled off to her office, returned holding a small bottle of some purple potion and a goblet.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll need to drink all of this. Harry,\" she said. \"It\\'s a potion for dreamless sleep.\"\\n\\nHarry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls. He felt himself becoming drowsy at once. Everything around him became hazy; the lamps around the hospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a friendly way through the screen around his bed; his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather matress. Before he could finish the potion, before he could say another word, his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep.\\n\\nHarry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn\\'t open his eyes, wanting to drop off again. The room was still dimly lit; he was sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that he couldn\\'t have been asleep very long.\\n\\nThen he heard whispering around him.\\n\\n\"They\\'ll wake him if they don\\'t shut up!\"\\n\\n\"What are they shouting about? Nothing else can have happened, can it?\"\\n\\nHarry opened his eyes blearily. Someone had removed his glasses. He could see the fuzzy outlines of Mrs. Weasley and Bill close by. Mrs. Weasley was on her feet.\\n\\n\"That\\'s Fudge\\'s voice,\" she whispered. \"And that\\'s Minerva McGonagall\\'s, isn\\'t it!\\n\\nBut what are they arguing about?\"\\n\\nNow Harry could hear them too: people shouting and running toward the hospital wing.\\n\\n\"Regrettable, but all the same, Minerva �\" Cornelius Fudge was saying loudly.\\n\\n\"You should never have brought it inside the castle!\" yelled Professor McGonagall. \"When Dumbledore finds out �\"\\n\\nHarry heard the hospital doors burst open. Unnoticed by any of the people around his bed, all of whom were staring at the door as Bill pulled back the screens, Harry sat up and put his glasses back on.\\n\\nFudge came striding up the ward. Professors McGonagall and Snape were at his heels.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Dumbledore?\" Fudge demanded of Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\n\"He\\'s not here,\" said Mrs. Weasley angrily. \"This is a hospital wing. Minister, don\\'t you think you\\'d do better to �\"\\n\\nBut the door opened, and Dumbledore came sweeping up the ward.\\n\\n\"What has happened?\" said Dumbledore sharply, looking from Fudge to Professor McGonagall. \"Why are you disturbing these people? Minerva, I\\'m surprised at you � I asked you to stand guard over Barty Crouch �\"\\n\\n\"There is no need to stand guard over him anymore, Dumble�dore!\" she shrieked.\\n\\n\"The Minister has seen to that!\"\\n\\nHarry had never seen Professor McGonagall lose control like this. There were angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and a hands were balled into fists; she was trembling with fury.� \"When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight\\'s events,\" said Snape, in a low voice; he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question. He insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle. He brought it up to the office where Barty Crouch �\"\\n\\n\"I told him you would not agree, Dumbledore!\" McGonagall fumed. \"I told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle, but �\"\\n\\n\"My dear woman!\" roared Fudge, who likewise looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him, \"as Minister of Magic, it is my decision whether I wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous �\"\\n\\nBut Professor McGonagall\\'s voice drowned Fudge\\'s.\\n\\n\"The moment that � that thing entered the room,\" she screamed, pointing at Fudge, trembling all over, \"it swooped down on Crouch and � and �\"\\n\\nHarry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened. He did not need her to finish her sentence. He knew what the dementor must have done. It had administered its fatal kiss to Barty Crouch. It had sucked his soul out through his mouth. He was worse than dead.\\n\\n\"By all accounts, he is no loss!\" blustered Fudge. \"It seems he has been responsible for several deaths\\'.\"\\n\\n\"But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,\" said Dumbledore. He was staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time. \"He cannot give evidence about why he killed those people.\"\\n\\n\"Why he killed them? Well, that\\'s no mystery, is it?\" blustered Fudge. \"He was a raving lunatic! From what Minerva and Severus have told me, he seems to have thought he was doing it all on You�Know�Who\\'s instructions!\"\\n\\n\"Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions, Cornelius,\" Dumbledore said.\\n\\n\"Those peoples deaths were mere by�products of a plan to restore Voldemort to full strength again. The plan succeeded. Voldemort has been restored to his body.\"\\n\\nFudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face.\\n\\nDazed and blinking, he stared back at Dumbledore as if he couldn\\'t quite believe what he had just heard. He began to sputter, still goggling at Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"You�Know�Who . . . returned? Preposterous. Come now, Dumbledore ...\"\\n\\n\"As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,\" said Dumbledore, \"we heard Barty Crouch confess. Under the influence of Veritaserum, he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and how Voldemort � learning of his continued existence from Bertha Jorkins � went to free him from his father and used him to capture Harry. The plan worked, I tell you. Crouch has helped Voldemort to return.\"\\n\\n\"See here, Dumbledore,\" said Fudge, and Harry was astonished to see a slight smile dawning on his face, \"you � you can\\'t seriously believe that You�Know�Who � back? Come now, come now . . . certainly, Crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon You�Know�Who\\'s orders � but to take the word of a lunatic like that, Dumbledore ...\"\\n\\n\"When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he was transported straight to Voldemort,\" said Dumbledore steadily. \"He witnessed Lord Voldemort\\'s rebirth. I\\n\\nwill explain it all to you if you will step up to my office.\"\\n\\nDumbledore glanced around at Harry and saw that he was awake, but shook his head and said, \"I am afraid I cannot permit you to question Harry tonight.\"\\n\\nFudge\\'s curious smile lingered. He too glanced at Harry, then looked back at Dumbledore, and said, \"You are � er � prepared to take Harry\\'s word on this, are you, Dumbledore?\"\\n\\nThere was a moment\\'s silence, which was broken by Sirius growling. His hackles were raised, and he was baring his teeth at Fudge.\\n\\n\"Certainly, I believe Harry,\" said Dumbledore. His eyes were blazing now. \"I heard Crouch\\'s confession, and I heard Harry\\'s account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make sense, they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.\"\\n\\nFudge still had that strange smile on his face. Once again, he glanced at Harry before answering.\\n\\n\"You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a boy who . . . well...\"\\n\\nFudge shot Harry another look, and Harry suddenly understood.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve been reading Rita Skeeter, Mr. Fudge,\" he said quietly.\\n\\nRon, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and Bill all jumped. None of them had realized that Harry was awake.\\n\\nFudge reddened slightly, but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face.\\n\\n\"And if I have?\" he said, looking at Dumbledore. \"If I have discovered that you\\'ve been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet? A Parselmouth, eh? And having funny turns all over the place �\"\\n\\n\"I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar?\" said Dumbledore coolly.\\n\\n\"You admit that he has been having these pains, then?\" said Fudge quickly.\\n\\n\"Headaches? Nightmares? Possibly � hallucinations?\"\\n\\n\"Listen to me, Cornelius,\" said Dumbledore, taking a step toward Fudge, and once again, he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that Harry had felt after Dumbledore had Stunned young Crouch. \"Harry is as sane as you or I. That scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains. I believe it hurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by, or feeling particularly murderous.\"\\n\\nFudge had taken half a step back from Dumbledore, but he looked no less stubborn.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll forgive me, Dumbledore, but I\\'ve never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before. ...\"\\n\\n\"Look, I saw Voldemort come back!\" Harry shouted. He tried to get out of bed again, but Mrs. Weasley forced him back. \"I saw the Death Eaters! I can give you their names! Lucius Malfoy �\"\\n\\nSnape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him, Snape\\'s eyes flew back to Fudge.\\n\\n\"Malfoy was cleared!\" said Fudge, visibly affronted. \"A very old family � donations to excellent causes �\"\\n\\n\"Macnair!\" Harry continued.\\n\\n\"Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry!\"\\n\\n\"Avery � Nott � Crabbe � Goyle �\"\\n\\n\"You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years ago!\" said Fudge angrily. \"You could have found those names in old reports of the trials! For heavens sake, Dumbledore � the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too � his tales are getting taller, and you\\'re still swallowing them � the boy can talk to snakes. Dumbledore, and you still think he\\'s trustworthy?\"\\n\\n\"You fool!\" Professor McGonagall cried. \"Cedric Diggory! Mr. Crouch! These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic!\"\\n\\n\"I see no evidence to the contrary!\" shouted Fudge, now matching her anger, his face purpling. \"It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years!\"\\n\\nHarry couldn\\'t believe what he was hearing. He had always thought of Fudge as a kindly figure, a little blustering, a little pompous, but essentially good�natured. But now a short, angry wizard stood before him, refusing, point�blank, to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world � to believe that Voldemort could have risen.\\n\\n\"Voldemort has returned,\" Dumbledore repeated. \"If you accept that fact straightaway. Fudge, and take the necessary measures, we may still be able to save the situation. The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from the control of the dementors �\"\\n\\n\"Preposterous!\" shouted Fudge again. \"Remove the dementors? I\\'d be kicked out of office for suggesting it! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at Azkaban!\"\\n\\n\"The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds, Cornelius, knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort\\'s most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will\\n\\njoin him the instant he asks them!\" said Dumbledore. \"They will not remain loyal to you, Fudge! Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can! With the dementors behind him, and his old supporters returned to him, you will be hard�pressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago!\"\\n\\nFudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words could express his outrage.\\n\\n\"The second step you must take � and at once,\" Dumbledore pressed on, \"is to send envoys to the giants.\"\\n\\n\"Envoys to the giants?\" Fudge shrieked, finding his tongue again. \"What madness is this?\"\\n\\n\"Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late,\" said Dumbledore, \"or Voldemort will persuade them, as he did before, that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom!\"\\n\\n\"You � you cannot be serious!\" Fudge gasped, shaking his head and retreating further from Dumbledore. \"If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants � people hate them, Dumbledore � end of my career �\"\\n\\n\"You are blinded,\" said Dumbledore, his voice rising now, the aura of power around him palpable, his eyes blazing once more, \"by the love of the office you hold, Cornelius! You place too much importance, and you always have done, on the so�called purity of blood! You fail to recognize that it matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be! Your dementor has just destroyed the last remaining member of a pure�blood family as old as any � and see what that man chose to make of his life! I tell you now� take the steps I have suggested, and you will be remembered, in office or out, as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers of Magic we have ever known. Fail to act � and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!\"\\n\\n\"Insane,\" whispered Fudge, still backing away. \"Mad . . .\"\\n\\nAnd then there was silence. Madam Pomfrey was standing frozen at the foot of Harry\\'s bed, her hands over her mouth. Mrs.Weasley was still standing over Harry, her hand on his shoulder to prevent him from rising. Bill, Ron, and Hermione were staring at Fudge.\\n\\n\"If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this, Cornelius,\"\\n\\nsaid Dumbledore, \"we have reached a parting of the ways. You must act as you see fit. And I � I shall act as I see fit.\"\\n\\nDumbledore\\'s voice carried no hint of a threat; it sounded like a mere statement, but Fudge bristled as though Dumbledore were advancing upon him with a wand.\\n\\n\"Now, see here, Dumbledore,\" he said, waving a threatening finger. \"I\\'ve given you free rein, always. I\\'ve had a lot of respect for you. I might not have agreed with some of your decisions, but I\\'ve kept quiet. There aren\\'t many who\\'d have let you hire werewolves, or keep Hagrid, or decide what to teach your students without reference to the Ministry. But if you\\'re going to work against me �\"\\n\\n\"The only one against whom I intend to work,\" said Dumbledore, \"is Lord Voldemort. If you are against him, then we remain, Cornelius, on the same side.\"\\n\\nIt seemed Fudge could think of no answer to this. He rocked backward and forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands.\\n\\nFinally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, \"He can\\'t be back, Dumbledore, he just can\\'t be ...\"\\n\\nSnape strode forward, past Dumbledore, pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as he went. He stuck out his forearm and showed it to Fudge, who recoiled.\\n\\n\"There,\" said Snape harshly. \"There. The Dark Mark. It is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago, when it burned black, but you can still see it. Every Death Eater had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord. It was a means of distinguishing one another, and his means of summoning us to him. When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate, instantly, at his side.\\n\\nThis Mark has been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff s too. Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the Mark burn. We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord\\'s vengeance. He betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold.\"\\n\\nFudge stepped back from Snape too. He was shaking his head. He did not seem to have taken in a word Snape had said. He stared, apparently repelled by the ugly mark on Snape\\'s arm, then looked up at Dumbledore and whispered, \"I don\\'t know what you and your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have heard enough. I have no more to add. I will be in touch with you tomorrow, Dumbledore, to discuss the running of this school. I must return to the Ministry.\"\\n\\nHe had almost reached the door when he paused. He turned around, strode back down the dormitory, and stopped at Harry\\'s bed.\\n\\n\"Your winnings,\" he said shortly, taking a large bag of gold out of his pocket and dropping it onto Harrys bedside table. \"One thousand Galleons. There should have been a presentation ceremony, but under the circumstances .. .\"\\n\\nHe crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out of the room, slamming the door behind him. The moment he had disappeared, Dumbledore turned to look at the group around Harry\\'s bed.\\n\\n\"There is work to be done,\" he said. \"Molly... am I right in thinking that I can count on you and Arthur?\"\\n\\n\"Of course you can,\" said Mrs. Weasley. She was white to the lips, but she looked\\n\\nresolute. \"We know what Fudge is. It\\'s Arthur\\'s fondness for Muggles that has held him back at the Ministry all these years. Fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride.\"\\n\\n\"Then I need to send a message to Arthur,\" said Dumbledore. \"All those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately, and he is well placed to contact those at the Ministry who are not as shortsighted as Cornelius.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go to Dad,\" said Bill, standing up. \"I\\'ll go now.\"\\n\\n\"Excellent,\" said Dumbledore. \"Tell him what has happened. Tell him I will be in direct contact with him shortly. He will need to be discreet, however. If Fudge thinks I am interfering at the Ministry �\"\\n\\n\"Leave it to me,\" said Bill.\\n\\nHe clapped a hand on Harry\\'s shoulder, kissed his mother on the cheek, pulled on his cloak, and strode quickly from the room.\\n\\n\"Minerva,\" said Dumbledore, turning to Professor McGonagall, \"I want to see Hagrid in my office as soon as possible. Also � if she will consent to come � Madame Maxime.\"\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall nodded and left without a word.\\n\\n\"Poppy,\" Dumbledore said to Madam Pomfrey, \"would you be very kind and go down to Professor Moodys office, where I think you will find a house�elf called Winky in considerable distress? Do what you can for her, and take her back to the kitchens. I think Dobby will look after her for us.\"\\n\\n\"Very � very well,\" said Madam Pomfrey, looking startled, and she too left.\\n\\nDumbledore made sure that the door was closed, and that Madam Pomfrey\\'s footsteps had died away, before he spoke again.\\n\\n\"And now,\" he said, \"it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are. Sirius ... if you could resume your usual form.\"\\n\\nThe great black dog looked up at Dumbledore, then, in an instant, turned back into a man.\\n\\nMrs. Weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed.\\n\\n\"Sirius Black!\" she shrieked, pointing at him.\\n\\n\"Mum, shut up!\" Ron yelled. \"It\\'s okay!\"\\n\\nSnape had not yelled or jumped backward, but the look on his face was one of mingled fury and horror.\\n\\n\"Him!\" he snarled, staring at Sirius, whose face showed equal dislike. \"What is he\\n\\ndoing here?\"\\n\\n\"He is here at my invitation,\" said Dumbledore, looking between them, \"as are you, Severus. I trust you both. It is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each other.\"\\n\\nHarry thought Dumbledore was asking for a near miracle. Sirius and Snape were eyeing each other with the utmost loathing.\\n\\n\"I will settle, in the short term,\" said Dumbledore, with a bite of impatience in his voice, \"for a lack of open hostility. You will shake hands. You are on the same side now. Time is short, and unless the few of us who know the truth do not stand united, there is no hope for any us.\\n\\nVery slowly � but still glaring at each other as though each wished the other nothing but ill � Sirius and Snape moved toward each other and shook hands. They let go extremely quickly.\\n\\n\"That will do to be going on with,\" said Dumbledore, stepping between them once more. \"Now I have work for each of you. Fudge\\'s attitude, though not unexpected, changes everything. Sirius, I need you to set off at once. You are to alert Remus Lupin, Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher � the old crowd. Lie low at Lupin\\'s for a while; I will contact you there.\"\\n\\n\"But �\" said Harry.\\n\\nHe wanted Sirius to stay. He did not want to have to say goodbye again so quickly.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll see me very soon. Harry,\" said Sirius, turning to him. \"I promise you. But I must do what I can, you understand, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"Yeah . . . of course I do.\"\\n\\nSirius grasped his hand briefly, nodded to Dumbledore, transformed again into the black dog, and ran the length of the room to the door, whose handle he turned with a paw. Then he was gone.\\n\\n\"Severus,\" said Dumbledore, turning to Snape, \"you know what I must ask you to do. If you are ready . . . if you are prepared ...\"\\n\\n\"I am,\" said Snape.\\n\\nHe looked slightly paler than usual, and his cold, black eyes glittered strangely.\\n\\n\"Then good luck,\" said Dumbledore, and he watched, with a trace of apprehension on his face, as Snape swept wordlessly after Sirius.\\n\\nIt was several minutes before Dumbledore spoke again.\\n\\n\"I must go downstairs,\" he said finally. \"I must see the Diggorys. Harry � take the rest of your potion. I will see all of you later.\"\\n\\nHarry slumped back against his pillows as Dumbledore disappeared. Hermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley were all looking at him. None of them spoke for a very long time.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got to take the rest of your potion. Harry,\" Mrs. Weasley said at last. Her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the bottle and the goblet. \"You have a good long sleep. Try and think about something else for a while . . . think about what you\\'re going to buy with your winnings!\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want that gold,\" said Harry in an expressionless voice. \"You have it.\\n\\nAnyone can have it. I shouldn\\'t have won it. It should\\'ve been Cedric\\'s.\"\\n\\nThe thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come out of the maze was threatening to overpower him. He could feel a burning, prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes. He blinked and stared up at the ceiling.\\n\\n\"It wasn\\'t your fault. Harry,\" Mrs. Weasley whispered.\\n\\n\"I told him to take the cup with me,\" said Harry.\\n\\nNow the burning feeling was in his throat too. He wished Ron would look away.\\n\\nMrs. Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry. He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother. The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs. Weasley held him to her. His mother s face, his father\\'s voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him.\\n\\nThere was a loud slamming noise, and Mrs. Weasley and Harry broke apart.\\n\\nHermione was standing by the window. She was holding something tight in her hand.\\n\\n\"Sorry,\" she whispered.\\n\\n\"Your potion, Harry,\" said Mrs. Weasley quickly, wiping her eyes on the back of her hand.\\n\\nHarry drank it in one gulp. The effect was instantaneous. Heavy, irresistible waves of dreamless sleep broke over him; he fell back onto his pillows and thought no more.\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY�SEVEN � THE BEGINNING\\n\\nWhen he looked back, even a month later, Harry found he had only scattered memories of the next few days. It was as though he had been through too much to take in any more. The recollections he did have were very painful. The worst, perhaps, was the meeting with the Diggorys that took place the following morning.\\n\\nThey did not blame him for what had happened; on the contrary, both thanked him for returning Cedric\\'s body to them. Mr. Diggory sobbed through most of the interview. Mrs. Diggory\\'s grief seemed to be beyond tears.\\n\\n\"He suffered very little then,\" she said, when Harry had told her how Cedric had died. \"And after all, Amos ... he died just when he\\'d won the tournament. He must have been happy.\"\\n\\nWhen they got to their feet, she looked down at Harry and said, \"You look after yourself, now.\"\\n\\nHarry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table.\\n\\n\"You take this,\" he muttered to her. \"It should\\'ve been Cedric\\'s, he got there first, you take it �\"\\n\\nBut she backed away from him.\\n\\n\"Oh no, it\\'s yours, dear, I couldn\\'t. . . you keep it.\"\\n\\nHarry returned to Gryffindor Tower the following evening. From what Hermione and Ron told him, Dumbledore had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast.\\n\\nHe had merely requested that they leave Harry alone, that nobody ask him questions or badger him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze. Most people, he noticed, were skirting him in the corridors, avoiding his eyes. Some whispered behind their hands as he passed. He guessed that many of them had believed Rita Skeeter\\'s article about how disturbed and possibly dangerous he was.\\n\\nPerhaps they were formulating their own theories about how Cedric had died. He found he didn\\'t care very much. He liked it best when he was with Ron and Hermione and they were talking about other things, or else letting him sit in silence while they played chess. He felt as though all three of them had reached an understanding they didn\\'t need to put into words; that each was waiting for some sign, some word, of what was going on outside Hogwarts � and that it was useless to speculate about what might be coming until they knew anything for certain. The only time they touched upon the subject was when Ron told Harry about a meeting Mrs. Weasley had had with Dumbledore before going home.\\n\\n\"She went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer,\" he said. \"But he wants you to go back to the Dursleys, at least at first.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"She said Dumbledore\\'s got his reasons,\" said Ron, shaking his head darkly. \"I suppose we\\'ve got to trust him, haven\\'t we?\"\\n\\nThe only person apart from Ron and Hermione that Harry felt able to talk to was Hagrid. As there was no longer a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, they had those lessons free. They used the one on Thursday afternoon to go down and visit Hagrid in his cabin. It was a bright and sunny day; Fang bounded out of the open door as they approached, barking and wagging his tail madly.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s that?\" called Hagrid, coming to the door. \"Harry!\"\\n\\nHe strode out to meet them, pulled Harry into a one�armed hug, ruffled his hair, and said, \"Good ter see yeh, mate. Good ter see yeh.\"\\n\\nThey saw two bucket�size cups and saucers on the wooden table in front of the fireplace when they entered Hagrid\\'s cabin.\\n\\n\"Bin havin\\' a cuppa with Olympe,\" Hagrid said. \"She\\'s jus\\' left.\"\\n\\n\"Who?\" said Ron curiously.\\n\\n\"Madame Maxime, o\\' course!\" said Hagrid.\\n\\n\"You two made up, have you?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Dunno what yeh\\'re talkin\\' about,\" said Hagrid airily, fetching more cups from the dresser. When he had made tea and offered around a plate of doughy cookies, he leaned back in his chair and surveyed Harry closely through his beetle�black eyes.\\n\\n\"You all righ\\'?\" he said gruffly \"Yeah,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"No, yeh\\'re not,\" said Hagrid. \"Course yeh\\'re not. But yeh will be.\"\\n\\nHarry said nothing.\\n\\n\"Knew he was goin\\' ter come back,\" said Hagrid, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked up at him, shocked. \"Known it fer years. Harry. Knew he was out there, bidin\\' his time. It had ter happen. Well, now it has, an\\' we\\'ll jus\\' have ter get on with it. We\\'ll fight. Migh\\' be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold. That\\'s Dumbledores plan, anyway. Great man, Dumbledore. \\'S long as we\\'ve got him, I\\'m not too worried.\"\\n\\nHagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving expressions on their faces.\\n\\n\"No good sittin\\' worryin\\' abou\\' it,\" he said. \"What\\'s comin\\' will come, an we\\'ll meet it when it does. Dumbledore told me wha\\' you did. Harry.\"\\n\\nHagrid\\'s chest swelled as he looked at Harry.\\n\\n\"Yeh did as much as yer father would\\'ve done, an\\' I can\\' give yeh no higher praise than that.\"\\n\\nHarry smiled back at him. It was the first time he\\'d smiled in days. \"What\\'s Dumbledore asked you to do, Hagrid?\" he asked. \"He sent Professor McGonagall to ask you and Madame Maxime to meet him � that night.\"\\n\\n\"Got a little job fer me over the summer,\" said Hagrid. \"Secret, though. I\\'m not s\\'pposed ter talk abou\\' it, no, not even ter you lot. Olympe � Madame Maxime ter you � might be comin\\' with me. I think she will. Think I got her persuaded.\"\\n\\n\"Is it to do with Voldemort?\"\\n\\nHagrid flinched at the sound of the name.\\n\\n\"Migh\\' be,\" he said evasively. \"Now . . . who\\'d like ter come an\\' visit the las\\' skrewt with me? I was jokin\\' � jokin\\'!\" he added hastily, seeing the looks on their faces.\\n\\nIt was with a heavy heart that Harry packed his trunk up in the dormitory on the night before his return to Privet Drive. He was dreading the Leaving Feast, which was usually a cause for celebration, when the winner of the Inter�House Championship would be announced. He had avoided being in the Great Hall when it was full ever since he had left the hospital wing, preferring to eat when it was nearly empty to avoid the stares of his fellow students.\\n\\nWhen he, Ron, and Hermione entered the Hall, they saw at once that the usual decorations were missing. The Great Hall was normally decorated with the winning House\\'s colors for the Leaving Feast. Tonight, however, there were black drapes on the wall behind the teachers\\' table. Harry knew instantly that they were there as a mark of respect to Cedric.\\n\\nThe real Mad�Eye Moody was at the staff table now, his wooden leg and his magical eye back in place. He was extremely twitchy, jumping every time someone spoke to him. Harry couldn\\'t blame him; Moodys fear of attack was bound to have been increased by his ten�month imprisonment in his own trunk.\\n\\nProfessor Karkaroff s chair was empty. Harry wondered, as he sat down with the other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff was now, and whether Voldemort had caught up with him.\\n\\nMadame Maxime was still there. She was sitting next to Hagrid. They were talking quietly together. Further along the table, sitting next to Professor McGonagall, was Snape. His eyes lingered on Harry for a moment as Harry looked at him. His expression was difficult to read. He looked as sour and unpleasant as ever. Harry continued to watch him, long after Snape had looked away.\\n\\nWhat was it that Snape had done on Dumbledores orders, the night that Voldemort had returned? And why. . . why . . . was Dumbledore so convinced that Snape was\\n\\ntruly on their side? He had been their spy, Dumbledore had said so in the Pensieve. Snape had turned spy against Voldemort, \"at great personal risk.\" Was that the job he had taken up again? Had he made contact with the Death Eaters, perhaps? Pretended that he had never really gone over to Dumbledore, that he had been, like Voldemort himself, biding his time!\\n\\nHarry\\'s musings were ended by Professor Dumbledore, who stood up at the staff table. The Great Hall, which in any case had been less noisy than it usually was at the Leaving Feast, became very quiet.\\n\\n\"The end,\" said Dumbledore, looking around at them all, \"of another year.\"\\n\\nHe paused, and his eyes fell upon the Hufflepuff table. Theirs had been the most subdued table before he had gotten to his feet, and theirs were still the saddest and palest faces in the Hall.\\n\\n\"There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight,\" said Dumbledore, \"but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who should be sitting here,\"\\n\\nhe gestured toward the Hufflepuffs, \"enjoying our feast with us. I would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric Diggory.\"\\n\\nThey did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the Hall stood, and raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice, \"Cedric Diggory.\"\\n\\nHarry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd. There were tears pouring silently down her face. He looked down at the table as they all sat down again.\\n\\n\"Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish Hufflepuff house,\" Dumbledore continued. \"He was a good and loyal friend, a hard worker, he valued fair play. His death has affected you all, whether you knew him well or not. I think that you have the right, therefore, to know exactly how it came about.\"\\n\\nHarry raised his head and stared at Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort.\"\\n\\nA panicked whisper swept the Great Hall. People were staring at Dumbledore in disbelief, in horror. He looked perfectly calm as he watched them mutter themselves into silence.\\n\\n\"The Ministry of Magic,\" Dumbledore continued, \"does not wish me to tell you this. It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so � either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, or because they think I should not tell you so, young as you are. It is my belief, however, that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident, or some sort of blunder of his own, is an insult to his memory.\"\\n\\nStunned and frightened, every face in the Hall was turned toward Dumbledore now... or almost every face. Over at the Slytherin table. Harry saw Draco Malfoy muttering something to Crabbe and Goyle. Harry felt a hot, sick swoop of anger in his stomach. He forced himself to look back at Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with Cedrics death,\" Dumbledore went on. \"I am talking, of course, about Harry Potter.\"\\n\\nA kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall as a few heads turned in Harry\\'s direction before flicking back to face Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort,\" said Dumbledore. \"He risked his own life to return Cedric\\'s body to Hogwarts. He showed, in every respect, the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort, and for this, I honor him.\"\\n\\nDumbledore turned gravely to Harry and raised his goblet once more. Nearly everyone in the Great Hall followed suit. They murmured his name, as they had murmured Cedric\\'s, and drank to him. But through a gap in the standing figures.\\n\\nHarry saw that Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and many of the other Slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched. Dumbledore, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see them.\\n\\nWhen everyone had once again resumed their seats, Dumbledore continued, \"The Triwizard Tournament\\'s aim was to further and promote magical understanding. In the light of what has happened � of Lord Voldemorts return � such ties are more important than ever before.\"\\n\\nDumbledore looked from Madame Maxime and Hagrid, to Fleur Delacour and her fellow Beauxbatons students, to Viktor Krum and the Durmstrangs at the Slytherin table. Krum, Harry saw, looked wary, almost frightened, as though he expected Dumbledore to say something harsh.\\n\\n\"Every guest in this Hall,\" said Dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the Durmstrang students, \"will be welcomed back here at any time, should they wish to come. I say to you all, once again � in the light of Lord Voldemort\\'s return, we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. Lord Voldemorts gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust. Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.\\n\\n\"It is my belief� and never have I so hoped that I am mistaken � that we are all facing dark and difficult times. Some of you in this Hall have already suffered directly at the hands of Lord Voldemort. Many of your families have been torn asunder. A week ago, a student was taken from our midst.\\n\\n\"Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord\\n\\nVoldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.\"\\n\\nHarry\\'s trunk was packed; Hedwig was back in her cage on top of it. He, Ron, and Hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the fourth years for the carriages that would take them back to Hogsmeade station. It was another beautiful summer\\'s day. He supposed that Privet Drive would be hot and leafy, its flower beds a riot of color, when he arrived there that evening. The thought gave him no pleasure at all.\\n\\n\"\\'Arry!\"\\n\\nHe looked around. Fleur Delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle.\\n\\nBeyond her, far across the grounds. Harry could see Hagrid helping Madame Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness. The Beauxbatons carriage was about to take off.\\n\\n\"We will see each uzzer again, I \\'ope,\" said Fleur as she reached him, holding out her hand. \"I am \\'oping to get a job \\'ere, to improve my Eenglish.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s very good already,\" said Ron in a strangled sort of voice. Fleur smiled at him; Hermione scowled.\\n\\n\"Good�bye, \\'Arry,\" said Fleur, turning to go. \"It \\'az been a pleasure meeting you!\"\\n\\nHarrys spirits couldn\\'t help but lift slightly as he watched Fleur hurry back across the lawns to Madame Maxime, her silvery hair rippling in the sunlight.\\n\\nWonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back,\" said Ron. \"D\\' you reckon they can steer that ship without Karkaroff?\"\\n\\n\"Karkaroff did not steer,\" said a gruff voice. \"He stayed in his cabin and let us do the vork.\"\\n\\nKrum had come to say good�bye to Hermione. \"Could I have a vord?\" he asked her.\\n\\n\"Oh . . . yes ... all right,\" said Hermione, looking slightly flustered, and following Krum through the crowd and out of sight.\\n\\n\"You\\'d better hurry up!\" Ron called loudly after her. \"The carriages\\'ll be here in a minute!\"\\n\\nHe let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and Hermione might be up to. They returned quite soon. Ron stared at Hermione, but her face was quite impassive.\\n\\n\"I liked Diggory,\" said Krum abruptly to Harry. \"He vos alvays polite to me.\\n\\nAlvays. Even though I vos from Durmstrang � with Karkaroff,\" he added, scowling.\\n\\n\"Have you got a new headmaster yet?\" said Harry Krum shrugged. He held out his hand as Fleur had done, shook Harry\\'s hand, and then Ron\\'s. Ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of painful internal struggle. Krum had already started walking away when Ron burst out, \"Can I have your autograph?\"\\n\\nHermione turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages that were now trundling toward them up the drive, as Krum, looking surprised but gratified, signed a fragment of parchment for Ron.\\n\\nThe weather could not have been more different on the journey back to King\\'s Cross than it had been on their way to Hogwarts the previous September. There wasn\\'t a single cloud in the sky. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had managed to get a compartment to themselves. Pigwidgeon was once again hidden under Rons dress robes to stop him from hooting continually; Hedwig was dozing, her head under her wing, and Crookshanks was curled up in a spare seat like a large, furry ginger cushion. Harry, Ron, and Hermione talked more fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped them southward. Harry felt as though Dumbledore\\'s speech at the Leaving Feast had unblocked him, somehow. It was less painful to discuss what had happened now. They broke off their conversation about what action Dumbledore might be taking, even now, to stop Voldemort only when the lunch trolley arrived.\\n\\nWhen Hermione returned from the trolley and put her money back into her schoolbag, she dislodged a copy of the Daily Prophet that she had been carrying in there. Harry looked at it, unsure whether he really wanted to know what it might say, but Hermione, seeing him looking at it, said calmly, \"There\\'s nothing in there.\\n\\nYou can look for yourself, but there\\'s nothing at all. I\\'ve been checking every day.\\n\\nJust a small piece the day after the third task saying you won the tournament. They didn\\'t even mention Cedric. Nothing about any of it. If you ask me. Fudge is forcing them to keep quiet.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'ll never keep Rita quiet,\" said Harry. \"Not on a story like this.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Rita hasn\\'t written anything at all since the third task,\" said Hermione in an oddly constrained voice. \"As a matter of fact,\" she added, her voice now trembling slightly, \"Rita Skeeter isn\\'t going to be writing anything at all for a while. Not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her.\"\\n\\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"I found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she wasn\\'t supposed to be coming onto the grounds,\" said Hermione in a rush.\\n\\nHarry had the impression that Hermione had been dying to tell them this for days, but that she had restrained herself in light of everything else that had happened.\\n\\n\"How was she doing it?\" said Harry at once.\\n\\n\"How did you find out?\" said Ron, staring at her.\\n\\n\"Well, it was you, really, who gave me the idea. Harry,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Did I?\" said Harry, perplexed. \"How?\"\\n\\n\"Bugging,\" said Hermione happily.\\n\\n\"But you said they didn\\'t work �\"\\n\\n\"Oh not electronic bugs,\" said Hermione. \"No, you see ... Rita Skeeter\" � Hermiones voice trembled with quiet triumph � \"is an unregistered Animagus. She can turn �\"\\n\\nHermione pulled a small sealed glass jar out other bag.\\n\\n\"� into a beetle.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re kidding,\" said Ron. \"You haven\\'t.. . she\\'s not...\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes she is,\" said Hermione happily, brandishing the jar at them.\\n\\nInside were a few twigs and leaves and one large, fat beetle.\\n\\n\"That\\'s never � you\\'re kidding �\" Ron whispered, lifting the jar to his eyes.\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m not,\" said Hermione, beaming. \"I caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing. Look very closely, and you\\'ll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears.\"\\n\\nHarry looked and saw that she was quite right. He also remembered something.\\n\\n\"There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard Hagrid telling Madame Maxime about his mum!\"\\n\\n\"Exactly,\" said Hermione. \"And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after we\\'d had our conversation by the lake. And unless I\\'m very much mistaken, Rita was perched on the windowsill of the Divination class the day your scar hurt. She\\'s been buzzing around for stories all year.\"\\n\\n\"When we saw Malfoy under that tree ...\" said Ron slowly.\\n\\n\"He was talking to her, in his hand,\" said Hermione. \"He knew, of course. That\\'s how she\\'s been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins. They wouldn\\'t care that she was doing something illegal, as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and Hagrid.\"\\n\\nHermione took the glass jar back from Ron and smiled at the beetle, which buzzed angrily against the glass.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve told her I\\'ll let her out when we get back to London,\" said Hermione. \"I\\'ve put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar, you see, so she can\\'t transform. And I\\'ve\\n\\ntold her she\\'s to keep her quill to herself for a whole year. See if she can\\'t break the habit of writing horrible lies about people.\"\\n\\nSmiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag.\\n\\nThe door of the compartment slid open.\\n\\n\"Very clever. Granger,\" said Draco Malfoy.\\n\\nCrabbe and Goyle were standing behind him. All three of them looked more pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more menacing, than Harry had ever seen them.\\n\\n\"So,\" said Malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them, a smirk quivering on his lips. \"You caught some pathetic reporter, and Potter\\'s Dumbledore\\'s favorite boy again. Big deal.\"\\n\\nHis smirk widened. Crabbe and Goyle leered.\\n\\n\"Trying not to think about it, are we?\" said Malfoy softly, looking around at all three of them. \"Trying to pretend it hasn\\'t happened?\"\\n\\n\"Get out,\" said Harry.\\n\\nHe had not been this close to Malfoy since he had watched him muttering to Crabbe and Goyle during Dumbledores speech about Cedric. He could feel a kind of ringing in his ears. His hand gripped his wand under his robes.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you you ought to choose your company more carefully, remember? When we met on the train, first day at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like this!\" He jerked his head at Ron and Hermione. \"Too late now. Potter! They\\'ll be the first to go, now the Dark Lord\\'s back! Mudbloods and Muggle�lovers first! Well � second � Diggory was the f�\"\\n\\nIt was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the compartment. Blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every direction, deafened by a series of bangs, Harry blinked and looked down at the floor.\\n\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway. He, Ron, and Hermione were on their feet, all three of them having used a different hex.\\n\\nNor were they the only ones to have done so.\\n\\n\"Thought we\\'d see what those three were up to,\" said Fred matter�of�factly, stepping onto Goyle and into the compartment. He had his wand out, and so did George, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he followed Fred inside.\\n\\n\"Interesting effect,\" said George, looking down at Crabbe. \"Who used the Furnunculus Curse?\"\\n\\n\"Me,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Odd,\" said George lightly. \"I used Jelly�Legs. Looks as though those two shouldn\\'t be mixed. He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face.\\n\\nWell, let\\'s not leave them here, they don\\'t add much to the decor.\"\\n\\nRon, Harry, and George kicked, rolled, and pushed the unconscious Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle � each of whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of jinxes with which they had been hit � out into the corridor, then came back into the compartment and rolled the door shut.\\n\\n\"Exploding Snap, anyone?\" said Fred, pulling out a pack of cards.\\n\\nThey were halfway through their fifth game when Harry decided to ask them.\\n\\n\"You going to tell us, then?\" he said to George. \"Who you were blackmailing?\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said George darkly. \"That.\"\\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter,\" said Fred, shaking his head impatiently. \"It wasn\\'t anything important. Not now, anyway.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ve given up,\" said George, shrugging.\\n\\nBut Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept on asking, and finally, Fred said, \"All right, all right, if you really want to know ... it was Ludo Bagman.\"\\n\\n\"Bagman?\" said Harry sharply. \"Are you saying he was involved in �\"\\n\\n\"Nah,\" said George gloomily. \"Nothing like that. Stupid git. He wouldn\\'t have the brains.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what, then?\" said Ron.\\n\\nFred hesitated, then said, \"You remember that bet we had with him at the Quidditch World Cup? About how Ireland would win, but Krum would get the Snitch?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry and Ron slowly.\\n\\n\"Well, the git paid us in leprechaun gold he\\'d caught from the Irish mascots.\"\\n\\n\"So?\"\\n\\n\"So,\" said Fred impatiently, \"it vanished, didn\\'t it? By next morning, it had gone!\"\\n\\n\"But � it must\\'ve been an accident, mustn\\'t it?\" said Hermione.\\n\\nGeorge laughed very bitterly.\\n\\n\"Yeah, that\\'s what we thought, at first. We thought if we just wrote to him, and told him he\\'d made a mistake, he\\'d cough up. But nothing doing. Ignored our\\n\\nletter. We kept trying to talk to him about it at Hogwarts, but he was always making some excuse to get away from us.\"\\n\\n\"In the end, he turned pretty nasty,\" said Fred. \"Told us we were too young to gamble, and he wasn\\'t giving us anything.\"\\n\\n\"So we asked for our money back,\" said George glowering.\\n\\n\"He didn\\'t refuse!\" gasped Hermione.\\n\\n\"Right in one,\" said Fred.\\n\\n\"But that was all your savings!\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Tell me about it,\" said George. \"\\'Course, we found out what was going on in the end. Lee Jordan\\'s dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as well.\\n\\nTurns out he\\'s in big trouble with the goblins. Borrowed loads of gold off them. A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold he had, and it still wasn\\'t enough to cover all his debts. They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He\\'s lost everything gambling. Hasn\\'t got two Galleons to rub together. And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back?\"\\n\\n\"How?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"He put a bet on you, mate,\" said Fred. \"Put a big bet on you to win the tournament. Bet against the goblins.\"\\n\\n\"So that\\'s why he kept trying to help me win!\" said Harry. \"Well � I did win, didn\\'t I? So he can pay you your gold!\"\\n\\n\"Nope,\" said George, shaking his head. \"The goblins play as dirty as him. They say you drew with Diggory, and Bagman was betting you\\'d win outright. So Bagman had to run for it. He did run for it right after the third task.\"\\n\\nGeorge sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards again.\\n\\nThe rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; Harry wished it could have gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never arrive at King\\'s Cross . . . but as he had learned the hard way that year, time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead, and all too soon, the Hogwarts Express was pulling in at platform nine and three�quarters. The usual confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark. Ron and Hermione struggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying their trunks. Harry, however, stayed put.\\n\\n\"Fred � George � wait a moment.\"\\n\\nThe twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his Triwizard winnings.\\n\\n\"Take it,\" he said, and he thrust the sack into George\\'s hands.\\n\\n\"What?\" said Fred, looking flabbergasted.\\n\\n\"Take it,\" Harry repeated firmly. \"I don\\'t want it.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re mental,\" said George, trying to push it back at Harry.\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m not,\" said Harry. \"You take it, and get inventing. It\\'s for the joke shop.\"\\n\\n\"He is mental,\" Fred said in an almost awed voice.\\n\\n\"Listen,\" said Harry firmly. \"If you don\\'t take it, I\\'m throwing it down the drain. I don\\'t want it and I don\\'t need it. But I could do with a few laughs. We could all do with a few laughs. I\\'ve got a feeling we\\'re going to need them more than usual before long.\"\\n\\n\"Harry,\" said George weakly, weighing the money bag in his hands, \"there\\'s got to be a thousand Galleons in here.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Think how many Canary Creams that is.\"\\n\\nThe twins stared at him.\\n\\n\"Just don\\'t tell your mum where you got it... although she might not be so keen for you to join the Ministry anymore, come to think of it. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Harry,\" Fred began, but Harry pulled out his wand.\\n\\n\"Look,\" he said flatly, \"take it, or I\\'ll hex you. I know some good ones now. Just do me one favor, okay? Buy Ron some different dress robes and say they\\'re from you.\"\\n\\nHe left the compartment before they could say another word, stepping over Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were still lying on the floor, covered in hex marks.\\n\\nUncle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier. Mrs. Weasley was close by him.\\n\\nShe hugged Harry very tightly when she saw him and whispered in his ear, \"I think Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer. Keep in touch, Harry.\"\\n\\n\"See you. Harry,\" said Ron, clapping him on the back.\\n\\n\"\\'Bye, Harry!\" said Hermione, and she did something she had never done before, and kissed him on the cheek.\\n\\n\"Harry � thanks,\" George muttered, while Fred nodded fervently at his side.\\n\\nHarry winked at them, turned to Uncle Vernon, and followed him silently from the station. There was no point worrying yet, he told himself, as he got into the back of the Dursleys\\' car.\\n\\nAs Hagrid had said, what would come, would come ... and he would have to meet it when it did.\\n'"

They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.\", 'Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.', \"The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\", 'When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.', 'None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.', 'At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\\'s drive.', \"It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\", \"But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...\", 'yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.', \"Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\", \"He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\", '\"The Potters, that\\'s right, that\\'s what I heard yes, their son, Harry\"', 'Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.', \"He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks...\", \"He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\", '\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn\\'t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don\\'t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\"', 'And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.', \"Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination.\", \"As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\", '\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn\\'t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.', 'Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\\'s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\"Won\\'t!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: \"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\\'s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster allowed himself a grin.', '\"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\"', '\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don\\'t know about that, but it\\'s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\\'ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it\\'s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\"', 'Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...', 'Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He\\'d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven\\'t heard from your sister lately, have you?\"', \"As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.\", '\"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\"', '\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...\"', '\"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley.', '\"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd.\"', 'Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\\'d heard the name \"Potter.\" He decided he didn\\'t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son -- he\\'d be about Dudley\\'s age now, wouldn\\'t he?\"', '\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.', '\"What\\'s his name again? Howard, isn\\'t it?\"', '\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\"', '\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite agree.\"', \"He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.\", 'While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there.', 'It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.', \"Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn't think he could bear it.\", \"The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them....\", 'How very wrong he was.', \"Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\", \"A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\", 'Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.', \"His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.\", 'Albus Dumbledore didn\\'t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \"I should have known.\"', \"He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.\", '\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"', 'He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.', '\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.', '\"My dear Professor, I \\'ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"', '\"You\\'d be stiff if you\\'d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said Professor McGonagall.', '\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"', 'Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.', '\"Oh yes, everyone\\'s celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently.', '\"You\\'d think they\\'d be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something\\'s going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her head back at the Dursleys\\' dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they\\'re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I\\'ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\"', '\"You can\\'t blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We\\'ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\"', '\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that\\'s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\"', 'She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\\'t, so she went on. \"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\"', '\"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"', '\"A what?\"', '\"A lemon drop. They\\'re a kind of Muggle sweet I\\'m rather fond of\"', '\"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\\'t think this was the moment for lemon drops. \"As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -\"', '\"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this \\'You- Know-Who\\' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets so confusing if we keep saying \\'You-Know-Who.\\' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\\'s name.', '\"I know you haven \\'t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \"But you\\'re different. Everyone knows you\\'re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\"', '\"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will never have.\"', '\"Only because you\\'re too -- well -- noble to use them.\"', '\"It\\'s lucky it\\'s dark. I haven\\'t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\"', 'Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone\\'s saying? About why he\\'s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\"', 'It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.', '\"What they\\'re saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric\\'s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they\\'re -- dead. \\x93', 'Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.', '\"Lily and James... I can\\'t believe it... I didn\\'t want to believe it...', 'Oh, Albus...\"', 'Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know... I know...\" he said heavily.', 'Professor McGonagall\\'s voice trembled as she went on. \"That\\'s not all.', \"They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.\", 'Dumbledore nodded glumly.', '\"It\\'s -- it\\'s true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he\\'s done... all the people he\\'s killed... he couldn\\'t kill a little boy? It\\'s just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\"', '\"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\"', 'Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch.', 'It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid\\'s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\\'d be here, by the way?\"', '\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don\\'t suppose you\\'re going to tell me why you\\'re here, of all places?\"', '\"I\\'ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\\'re the only family he has left now.\"', '\"You don\\'t mean -- you can\\'t mean the people who live here?\" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.', '\"Dumbledore -- you can\\'t. I\\'ve been watching them all day. You couldn\\'t find two people who are less like us. And they\\'ve got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.', 'Harry Potter come and live here!\"', '\"It\\'s the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\\'s older. I\\'ve written them a letter.\"', '\"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\\'ll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn\\'t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name!\"', '\"Exactly,\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy\\'s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\\'t even remember! CarA you see how much better off he\\'ll be, growing up away from all that until he\\'s ready to take it?\"', 'Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, \"Yes -- yes, you\\'re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.', '\"Hagrid\\'s bringing him.\"', '\"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\"', 'I would trust Hagrid with my life,\" said Dumbledore.', '\"I\\'m not saying his heart isn\\'t in the right place,\" said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can\\'t pretend he\\'s not careless. He does tend to -- what was that?\"', 'A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.', 'If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.', '\"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\"', '\"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit,\" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I\\'ve got him, sir.\"', '\"No problems, were there?\"', '\"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\\' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\\' over Bristol.\"', 'Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.', '\"Is that where -?\" whispered Professor McGonagall.', '\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He\\'ll have that scar forever.\"', '\"Couldn\\'t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\"', '\"Even if I could, I wouldn\\'t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we\\'d better get this over with.\"', \"Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.\", '\"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?\" asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.', '\"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"you\\'ll wake the Muggles!\"', '\"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \"But I c-c-can\\'t stand it -- Lily an\\' James dead -- an\\' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -\"', '\"Yes, yes, it\\'s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\\'ll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\\'s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\\'s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore\\'s eyes seemed to have gone out.', '\"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that\\'s that. We\\'ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\"', '\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I\\'ll be takin\\' Sirius his bike back. G\\'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.\"', 'Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.', '\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.', 'Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.', '\"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.', 'A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\\' time by Mrs. Dursley\\'s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn\\'t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!\"', \"Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.\", 'Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.', 'The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.', 'Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.', '\"Up! Get up! Now!\"', 'Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.', '\"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\\'d had the same dream before.', 'His aunt was back outside the door.', '\"Are you up yet?\" she demanded.', '\"Nearly,\" said Harry.', '\"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\\'t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\\'s birthday.\"', 'Harry groaned.', '\"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door.', '\"Nothing, nothing...\"', \"Dudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\", \"When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast.\", \"Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\", '\"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don\\'t ask questions.\"', \"Don't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.\", 'Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.', '\"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.', 'About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way -- all over the place.', 'Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.', \"Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents.\", 'His face fell.', '\"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That\\'s two less than last year.\"', '\"Darling, you haven\\'t counted Auntie Marge\\'s present, see, it\\'s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\"', '\"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face.', 'Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.', 'Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we\\'ll buy you another two presents while we\\'re out today. How\\'s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right\\'\\' Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So I\\'ll have thirty ... thirty...\"', '\"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia.', '\"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\"', 'Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money\\'s worth, just like his father. \\'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley\\'s hair.', 'At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.', '\"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg\\'s broken her leg. She can\\'t take him.\" She jerked her head in Harry\\'s direction.', \"Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned.\", '\"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\\'d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn\\'t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.', '\"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested.', '\"Don\\'t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\"', \"The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug.\", '\"What about what\\'s-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?\"', '\"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia.', '\"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he\\'d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley\\'s computer).', \"Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon.\", '\"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled.', '\"I won\\'t blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren\\'t listening.', '\"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \"...', 'and leave him in the car....\"', '\"That car\\'s new, he\\'s not sitting in it alone....\"', \"Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\", '\"Dinky Duddydums, don\\'t cry, Mummy won\\'t let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him.', '\"I... don\\'t... want... him... t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp- spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother\\'s arms.', 'Just then, the doorbell rang -- \"Oh, good Lord, they\\'re here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley\\'s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people\\'s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.', \"Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\", '\"I\\'m warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry\\'s, \"I\\'m warning you now, boy -- any funny business, anything at all -- and you\\'ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\"', '\"I\\'m not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly..', \"But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did.\", \"The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.\", 'Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn\\'t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.', \"Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.\", \"Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished.\", \"On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump.\", \"But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room.\", 'While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.', '\"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.', 'I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.\"', 'Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON\\'T FLY!\"', 'Dudley and Piers sniggered.', 'I know they don\\'t,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\"', \"But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.\", \"It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond.\", \"Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.\", 'Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.', \"After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\", 'Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.', '\"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn\\'t budge.', '\"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.', '\"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.', \"Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\", \"The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.\", 'It winked.', \"Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\", 'The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \"I get that all the time.', '\"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\\'t sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\"', 'The snake nodded vigorously.', '\"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked.', 'The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.', 'Boa Constrictor, Brazil.', '\"Was it nice there?\"', 'The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see -- so you\\'ve never been to Brazil?\"', 'As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.', '\"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON\\'T BELIEVE WHAT IT\\'S DOING!\"', 'Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.', '\"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.', \"Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.\", 'As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.\"', 'The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.', '\"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\"', 'The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\\'t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\\'s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren\\'t you, Harry?\"', 'Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.', \"Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.\", \"He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\", 'When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.', \"At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\", 'The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.', \"Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\", \"This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\", '\"They stuff people\\'s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\"', 'he told Harry. \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\"', '\"No, thanks,\" said Harry. \"The poor toilet\\'s never had anything as horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick.\" Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he\\'d said.', \"One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn 't as bad as usual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years.\", \"That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\", \"As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\", 'There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.', '\"What\\'s this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.', '\"Your new school uniform,\" she said.', 'Harry looked in the bowl again.', '\"Oh,\" he said, \"I didn\\'t realize it had to be so wet.\"', '\"DotA be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"I\\'m dyeing some of Dudley\\'s old things gray for you. It\\'ll look just like everyone else\\'s when I\\'ve finished.\"', 'Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.', \"Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.\", 'They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.', '\"Get the mail, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.', '\"Make Harry get it.\"', '\"Get the mail, Harry.\"', '\"Make Dudley get it.\"', '\"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\"', \"Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and -- a letter for Harry.\", \"Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.\", 'Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H.', '\"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \"What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke.', 'Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.', 'Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.', '\"Marge\\'s ill,\" he informed Aunt Petunia. \"Ate a funny whelk. --.\"', '\"Dad!\" said Dudley suddenly. \"Dad, Harry\\'s got something!\"', 'Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.', '\"That\\'s mine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.', '\"Who\\'d be writing to you?\" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn\\'t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.', '\"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped.', 'Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.', '\"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!\"', \"They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\", '\"I want to read that letter,\" he said loudly. want to read it,\" said Harry furiously, \"as it\\'s mine.\"', '\"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.', \"Harry didn't move.\", 'I WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted.', '\"Let me see it!\" demanded Dudley.', '\"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.', '\"Vernon,\" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \"look at the address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don\\'t think they\\'re watching the house?\"', '\"Watching -- spying -- might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.', '\"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don\\'t want --\"', \"Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.\", '\"No,\" he said finally. \"No, we\\'ll ignore it. If they don\\'t get an answer... Yes, that\\'s best... we won\\'t do anything....', '\"But --\"', '\"I\\'m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\\'t we swear when we took him in we\\'d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\"', \"That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\", '\"Where\\'s my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \"Who\\'s writing to me?\"', '\"No one. it was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon shortly.', '\"I have burned it.\"', '\"It was not a mistake,\" said Harry angrily, \"it had my cupboard on it.\"', '\"SILENCE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.', '\"Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking... you\\'re really getting a bit big for it... we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley\\'s second bedroom.', '\"Why?\" said Harry.', '\"Don\\'t ask questions!\" snapped his uncle. \"Take this stuff upstairs, now.\"', \"The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched.\", 'From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don\\'t want him in there... I need that room... make him get out....\"', \"Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.\", \"Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\", 'When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \"There\\'s another one! \\'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --\\'\\x93', \"With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand.\", '\"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry.', '\"Dudley -- go -- just go.\"', \"Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure they didn't fail. He had a plan.\", \"The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\", \"He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door -- Harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat -- something alive! Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.\", 'Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.', 'I want --\" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.', '\"See,\" he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \"if they can\\'t deliver them they\\'ll just give up.\"', '\"I\\'m not sure that\\'ll work, Vernon.\"', '\"Oh, these people\\'s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they\\'re not like you and me,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.', \"On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.\", 'Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\"', 'as he worked, and jumped at small noises.', 'On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.', '\"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\" Dudley asked Harry in amazement.', 'On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.', '\"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \"no damn letters today --\"', 'Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one.', '\"Out! OUT!\"', 'Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.', 'When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.', '\"That does it,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We\\'re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\"', 'He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway.', 'Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.', 'They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\\'t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. \"Shake\\'em off... shake \\'em off,\" he would mutter whenever he did this.', \"They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\", 'Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering....', 'They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.', '\"\\'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an \\'undred of these at the front desk.\"', 'She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: Mr. H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.', '\"I\\'ll take them,\" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.', 'Wouldn\\'t it be better just to go home, dear?\" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn\\'t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.', '\"Daddy\\'s gone mad, hasn\\'t he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.', 'It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley sniveled.', '\"It\\'s Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto\\'s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television. \\x93', \"Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.\", \"Still, you weren't eleven every day.\", \"Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd bought.\", '\"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\"', 'It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.', '\"Storm forecast for tonight!\" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \"And this gentleman\\'s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\"', 'A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.', '\"I\\'ve already got us some rations,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"so all aboard!\"', 'It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.', 'The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.', \"Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.\", '\"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?\" he said cheerfully.', \"He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.\", 'As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.', \"The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\", \"Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did.\", \"Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow.\", \"Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty ... ten...\", \"nine -- maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three... two...\", 'one...', 'BOOM.', 'The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.', 'BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \"Where\\'s the cannon?\" he said stupidly.', 'There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.', '\"Who\\'s there?\" he shouted. \"I warn you -- I\\'m armed!\"', 'There was a pause. Then \\x96', 'SMASH!', 'The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.', 'A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.', 'The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.', '\"Couldn\\'t make us a cup o\\' tea, could yeh? It\\'s not been an easy journey...\"', 'He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.', '\"Budge up, yeh great lump,\" said the stranger.', 'Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.', '\"An\\' here\\'s Harry!\" said the giant.', 'Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.', '\"Las\\' time I saw you, you was only a baby,\" said the giant. \"Yeh look a lot like yet dad, but yeh\\'ve got yet mom\\'s eyes.\"', 'Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.', 'I demand that you leave at once, sit!\" he said. \"You are breaking and entering!\"', '\"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\\'s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.', 'Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.', '\"Anyway -- Harry,\" said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \"a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat on it at some point, but it\\'ll taste all right.\"', 'From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.', 'Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \"Who are you?\"', 'The giant chuckled.', '\"True, I haven\\'t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\"', \"He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm.\", '\"What about that tea then, eh?\" he said, rubbing his hands together.', '\"I\\'d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh\\'ve got it, mind.\"', \"His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath.\", 'The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \"Don\\'t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\"', 'The giant chuckled darkly.', '\"Yet great puddin\\' of a son don\\' need fattenin\\' anymore, Dursley, don\\' worry.\"', 'He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\\'t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \"I\\'m sorry, but I still don\\'t really know who you are.\"', 'The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.', '\"Call me Hagrid,\" he said, \"everyone does. An\\' like I told yeh, I\\'m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh\\'ll know all about Hogwarts, o\\' course.', '\"Er -- no,\" said Harry.', 'Hagrid looked shocked.', '\"Sorry,\" Harry said quickly.', '\"Sony?\" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. \"It\\' s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren\\'t gettin\\' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn\\'t even know abou\\' Hogwarts, fer cryin\\' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all?\"', '\"All what?\" asked Harry.', '\"ALL WHAT?\" Hagrid thundered. \"Now wait jus\\' one second!\"', 'He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut.', 'The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.', '\"Do you mean ter tell me,\" he growled at the Dursleys, \"that this boy -- this boy! -- knows nothin\\' abou\\' -- about ANYTHING?\"', \"Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad.\", '\"I know some things,\" he said. \"I can, you know, do math and stuff.\" But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \"About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents\\' world.\"', '\"What world?\"', 'Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.', '\"DURSLEY!\" he boomed.', 'Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like \"Mimblewimble.\" Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.', '\"But yeh must know about yet mom and dad,\" he said. \"I mean, they\\'re famous. You\\'re famous.\"', '\"What? My -- my mom and dad weren\\'t famous, were they?\"', '\"Yeh don\\' know... yeh don\\' know...\" Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.', '\"Yeh don\\' know what yeh are?\" he said finally.', 'Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.', '\"Stop!\" he commanded. \"Stop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!\"', 'A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.', '\"You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An\\' you\\'ve kept it from him all these years?\"', '\"Kept what from me?\" said Harry eagerly.', '\"STOP! I FORBID YOU!\" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.', 'Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.', '\"Ah, go boil yet heads, both of yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"Harry -- yet a wizard.\"', 'There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.', '\"-- a what?\" gasped Harry.', '\"A wizard, o\\' course,\" said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, \"an\\' a thumpin\\' good\\'un, I\\'d say, once yeh\\'ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an\\' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An\\' I reckon it\\'s abou\\' time yeh read yer letter.\"', 'Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H.

Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.', 'Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.', 'Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside Harry\\'s head like fireworks and he couldn\\'t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \"What does it mean, they await my owl?\"', '\"Gallopin\\' Gorgons, that reminds me,\" said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment.', 'With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter.', 'Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.', \"Weather's horrible. Hope you're Well.\", 'Hagrid Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm.

It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.', '\"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you\\'d be just the same, just as strange, just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!\"', 'Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, \"Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\"', '\"CAR CRASH!\" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. \"How could a car crash kill Lily an\\' James Potter? It\\'s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin\\' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!\" \"But why? What happened?\" Harry asked urgently.', \"The anger faded from Hagrid's face. He looked suddenly anxious.\", '\"I never expected this,\" he said, in a low, worried voice. \"I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin\\' hold of yeh, how much yeh didn\\'t know.

That\\'s what yeh get when a Powerful, evil curse touches yeh -- took care of yer mum an\\' dad an\\' yer house, even -- but it didn\\'t work on you, an\\' that\\'s why yer famous, Harry.

As Hagrid's story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.\", 'Hagrid was watching him sadly.', '\"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore\\'s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot...\"', '\"Load of old tosh,\" said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage.

A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He\\'d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn\\'t they been turned into warty toads every time they\\'d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he\\'d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football? \"Hagrid,\" he said quietly, \"I think you must have made a mistake.

Hadn't he set a boa constrictor on him?

Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.', 'Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.', '\"Shouldn\\'ta lost me temper,\" he said ruefully, \"but it didn\\'t work anyway.

Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.', 'Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn\\'t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, \"See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\"', '\"Hagrid,\" said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \"did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\"', '\"Well, so they say,\" said Hagrid. \"Crikey, I\\'d like a dragon.\"', '\"You\\'d like one?\"', '\"Wanted one ever since I was a kid -- here we go.\"', 'They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes\\' time.

He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.', '\"I don\\'t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\" he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.', \"Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help trusting him.\", '\"This is it,\" said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \"the Leaky Cauldron. It\\'s a famous place.\"', \"It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\", 'For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\"', '\"Can\\'t, Tom, I\\'m on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry\\'s shoulder and making Harry\\'s knees buckle.', '\"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this -- can this be --?\"', 'The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.', '\"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter... what an honor.\"', 'He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.', '\"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\"', \"Harry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him.

He remembers me!\" Harry shook hands again and again -- Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.', 'A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously.

They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.\", 'The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.', 'Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring -- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.', '\"Yeah, you\\'ll be needin\\' one,\" said Hagrid, \"but we gotta get yer money first.\"', 'Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \"Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they\\'re mad....\"', 'A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry\\'s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new Nimbus Two Thousand -- fastest ever --\" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels\\' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon....', '\"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid.', 'They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was - \"Yeah, that\\'s a goblin,\" said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.', 'He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn.', 'So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there.', '\"Like I said, Yeh\\'d be mad ter try an\\' rob it,\" said Hagrid.', 'A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.', 'There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.', '\"Morning,\" said Hagrid to a free goblin. \"We\\'ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter\\'s safe.\"', '\"You have his key, Sir?\"', '\"Got it here somewhere,\" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin\\'s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.', '\"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.', 'The goblin looked at it closely.', '\"That seems to be in order.\"', '\"An\\' I\\'ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \"It\\'s about the YouKnow-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\"', 'The goblin read the letter carefully.', '\"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have Someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\"', 'Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.', '\"What\\'s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\" Harry asked.', '\"Can\\'t tell yeh that,\" said Hagrid mysteriously. \"Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore\\'s trusted me. More\\'n my job\\'s worth ter tell yeh that.\"', 'Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some difficulty -- and were off.', \"At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering.\", \"Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.\", 'I never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \"what\\'s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\"', '\"Stalagmite\\'s got an \\'m\\' in it,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\' don\\' ask me questions just now, I think I\\'m gonna be sick.\"', 'He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.', 'Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.', '\"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid.', \"All Harry's -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\", 'Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.', '\"The gold ones are Galleons,\" he explained. \"Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\\'s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o\\' terms, we\\'ll keep the rest safe for yeh.\" He turned to Griphook. \"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\"', '\"One speed only,\" said Griphook.', 'They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.', 'Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.', '\"Stand back,\" said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.', '\"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\\'d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\" said Griphook.', '\"How often do you check to see if anyone\\'s inside?\" Harry asked.', '\"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.', 'Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.', '\"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don\\'t talk to me on the way back, it\\'s best if I keep me mouth shut,\" said Hagrid.', \"One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole life -- more money than even Dudley had ever had.\", '\"Might as well get yer uniform,\" said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin\\'s Robes for All Occasions. \"Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\" He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin\\'s shop alone, feeling nervous.', 'Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.', '\"Hogwarts, clear?\" she said, when Harry started to speak. \"Got the lot here -- another young man being fitted up just now, in fact. \\x93', 'In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.', '\"Hello,\" said the boy, \"Hogwarts, too?\"', '\"Yes,\" said Harry.', '\"My father\\'s next door buying my books and mother\\'s up the street looking at wands,\" said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \"Then I\\'m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don\\'t see why first years can\\'t have their own. I think I\\'ll bully father into getting me one and I\\'ll smuggle it in somehow.\"', 'Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.', '\"Have you got your own broom?\" the boy went on.', '\"No,\" said Harry.', '\"Play Quidditch at all?\"', '\"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.', '\"I do -- Father says it\\'s a crime if I\\'m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\\'ll be in yet?\"', '\"No,\" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.', '\"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I\\'ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\\'d leave, wouldn\\'t you?\" \"Mmm,\" said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.', '\"I say, look at that man!\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\\'t come in.', '\"That\\'s Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn\\'t.', '\"He works at Hogwarts.\"', '\"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I\\'ve heard of him. He\\'s a sort of servant, isn\\'t he?\"', '\"He\\'s the gamekeeper,\" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.', '\"Yes, exactly. I heard he\\'s a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.\"', '\"I think he\\'s brilliant,\" said Harry coldly.', '\"Do you?\" said the boy, with a slight sneer. \"Why is he with you? Where are your parents?\"', '\"They\\'re dead,\" said Harry shortly. He didn\\'t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.', '\"Oh, sorry,\" said the other,. not sounding sorry at all. \"But they were our kind, weren\\'t they?\"', '\"They were a witch and wizard, if that\\'s what you mean.\"', '\"I really don\\'t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They\\'re just not the same, they\\'ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families.', 'What\\'s your surname, anyway?\"', 'But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \"That\\'s you done, my dear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.', '\"Well, I\\'ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\" said the drawling boy.', 'Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).', '\"What\\'s up?\" said Hagrid.', '\"Nothing,\" Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \"Hagrid, what\\'s Quidditch?\"', '\"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\\' how little yeh know -- not knowin\\' about Quidditch!\"', '\"Don\\'t make me feel worse,\" said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin\\'s.', '\"--and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\\'t even be allowed in.\"', '\"Yer not from a Muggle family. If he\\'d known who yeh were -- he\\'s grown up knowin\\' yer name if his parents are wizardin\\' folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh.

There\\'s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\\' duffers, but --\"', '\"I bet I\\'m in Hufflepuff\" said Harry gloomily.', '\"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"There\\'s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn\\'t in Slytherin.', 'You-Know-Who was one.\"', '\"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\"', '\"Years an\\' years ago,\" said Hagrid.', \"They bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.\", '\"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\"', '\"I\\'m not sayin\\' that\\'s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\' anyway, yeh couldn\\' work any of them curses yet, yeh\\'ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\"', 'Hagrid wouldn\\'t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\"It says pewter on yer list\"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).', \"Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again.\", '\"Just yer wand left - A yeah, an\\' I still haven\\'t got yeh a birthday present.\"', 'Harry felt himself go red.', '\"You don\\'t have to --\"', '\"I know I don\\'t have to.

All the kids want owls, they\\'re dead useful, carry yer mail an\\' everythin\\'.\"', \"Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.\", '\"Don\\' mention it,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"Don\\' expect you\\'ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\"', 'A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.', 'The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.', 'A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.', '\"Good afternoon,\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.', 'An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.', '\"Hello,\" said Harry awkwardly.', '\"Ah yes,\" said the man. \"Yes, yes. I thought I\\'d be seeing you soon.', 'Harry Potter.\" It wasn\\'t a question. \"You have your mother\\'s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\"', 'Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.', '\"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches.', 'Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it -- it\\'s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\"', 'Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.', '\"And that\\'s where...\"', \"Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a long, white finger.\", '\"I\\'m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\" he said softly.', '\"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands... well, if I\\'d known what that wand was going out into the world to do....\"', \"He shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid.\", '\"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\\'t it?\"', '\"It was, sir, yes,\" said Hagrid.', '\"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.', '\"Er -- yes, they did, yes,\" said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \"I\\'ve still got the pieces, though,\" he added brightly.', '\"But you don\\'t use them?\" said Mr. Ollivander sharply.', '\"Oh, no, sit,\" said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.', '\"Hmmm,\" said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \"Well, now -- Mr. Potter. Let me see.\" He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. \"Which is your wand arm?\"', '\"Er -- well, I\\'m right-handed,\" said Harry.', '\"Hold out your arm. That\\'s it.\" He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \"Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard\\'s wand.\"', 'Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.', '\"That will do,\" he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. \"Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.\"', 'Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.', '\"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try --\"', 'Harry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.', '\"No, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.', 'Go on, go on, try it out.\"', 'Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.', '\"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\\'ll find the perfect match here somewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination -- holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\"', 'Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \"Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... \\x93', 'He put Harry\\'s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \"Curious... curious..', '\"Sorry,\" said Harry, \"but what\\'s curious?\"', 'Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.', '\"I remember every wand I\\'ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that scar.\"', 'Harry swallowed.', '\"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter.... After all, He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great.\"', \"Harry shivered. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.\", \"The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn't speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry's lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.\", '\"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\" he said.', 'He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.', '\"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\" said Hagrid.', \"Harry wasn't sure he could explain. He'd just had the best birthday of his life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.\", '\"Everyone thinks I\\'m special,\" he said at last. \"All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don\\'t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I\\'m famous and I can\\'t even remember what I\\'m famous for. I don\\'t know what happened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died.\"', 'Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.', '\"Don\\' you worry, Harry. You\\'ll learn fast enough.

But yeh\\'ll have a great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, \\'smatter of fact.\"', 'Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.', '\"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, \" he said. \"First o\\' September -- King\\'s Cross -- it\\'s all on yer ticket.

Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.', \"Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all.\", 'Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.', \"Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.\", \"On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television.

We\\'re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\\'t bother.\"', '\"Why are you going to London?\" Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.', '\"Taking Dudley to the hospital,\" growled Uncle Vernon. \"Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\"', \"Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes -- he'd change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.\", \"They reached King's Cross at half past ten.

Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don\\'t seem to have built it yet, do they?\"', 'He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.', '\"Have a good term,\" said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away.', \"All three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do?

Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but the guard said there wasn't one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic.\", 'According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.', \"Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley.

A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O'clock.

Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.', '\"Ron, you\\'ve got something on your nose.\"', 'The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.', '\"Mom -- geroff\" He wriggled free.', '\"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\" said one of the twins.', '\"Shut up,\" said Ron.', '\"Where\\'s Percy?\" said their mother.', '\"He\\'s coming now.\"', 'The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it.', '\"Can\\'t stay long, Mother,\" he said. \"I\\'m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves --\"', '\"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?\" said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. \"You should have said something, we had no idea.\"', '\"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\" said the other twin. \"Once --\"', '\"Or twice --\"', '\"A minute --\"', '\"All summer --\"', '\"Oh, shut up,\" said Percy the Prefect.', '\"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\" said one of the twins.', '\"Because he\\'s a prefect,\" said their mother fondly. \"All right, dear, well, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there.\"', 'She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.', '\"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you\\'ve -- you\\'ve blown up a toilet or --\"', '\"Blown up a toilet? We\\'ve never blown up a toilet.\"', '\"Great idea though, thanks, Mom.\"', '\"It\\'s not funny. And look after Ron.\"', '\"Don\\'t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\"', '\"Shut up,\" said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.', '\"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\"', \"Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking.\", '\"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?\"', '\"Who?\"', '\"Harry Potter!\"', \"Harry heard the little girl's voice.\", '\"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please....\"', '\"You\\'ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn\\'t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\"', '\"Asked him. Saw his scar. It\\'s really there - like lightning.\"', '\"Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.\"', '\"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?\"', 'Their mother suddenly became very stern.', '\"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\\'t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.\"', '\"All right, keep your hair on.\"', 'A whistle sounded.', '\"Hurry up!\" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry.', '\"Don\\'t, Ginny, we\\'ll send you loads of owls.\"', '\"We\\'ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\"', '\"George!\"', '\"Only joking, Mom.\"', \"The train began to move. Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\", \"Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.\", 'The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.', '\"Anyone sitting there?\" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry.', '\"Everywhere else is full.\"', \"Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.\", '\"Hey, Ron.\"', 'The twins were back.', '\"Listen, we\\'re going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan\\'s got a giant tarantula down there.\"', '\"Right,\" mumbled Ron.', '\"Harry,\" said the other twin, \"did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.', '\"Bye,\" said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.', '\"Are you really Harry Potter?\" Ron blurted out.', 'Harry nodded.', '\"Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George\\'s jokes,\" said Ron. \"And have you really got -- you know...\"', \"He pointed at Harry's forehead.\", 'Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.', '\"So that\\'s where You-Know-Who \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I can\\'t remember it.\"', '\"Nothing?\" said Ron eagerly.', '\"Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\"', '\"Wow,\" said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.', '\"Are all your family wizards?\" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.', '\"Er -- Yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom\\'s got a second cousin who\\'s an accountant, but we never talk about him.\"', '\"So you must know loads of magic already.\"', 'The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.', '\"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they like?\"', '\"Horrible -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I\\'d had three wizard brothers.\"', '\"Five,\" said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \"I\\'m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I\\'ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy\\'s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they\\'re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it\\'s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I\\'ve got Bill\\'s old robes, Charlie\\'s old wand, and Percy\\'s old rat.\"', 'Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.', '\"His name\\'s Scabbers and he\\'s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn\\'t aff -- I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\"', \"Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.\", \"Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.\", '\"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn\\'t know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort\"', 'Ron gasped.', '\"What?\" said Harry.', '\"You said You-Know-Who\\'s name!\" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \"I\\'d have thought you, of all people --\"', '\"I\\'m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said Harry, I just never knew you shouldn\\'t. See what I mean? I\\'ve got loads to learn.... I bet,\" he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, \"I bet I\\'m the worst in the class.\"', '\"You won\\'t be. There\\'s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.\"', 'While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.', 'Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.', 'Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \"Anything off the cart, dears?\"', \"Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor.\", \"He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.\", 'Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.', '\"Hungry, are you?\"', '\"Starving,\" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.', 'Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \"She always forgets I don\\'t like corned beef.\"', '\"Swap you for one of these,\" said Harry, holding up a pasty. \"Go on --\"', '\"You don\\'t want this, it\\'s all dry,\" said Ron. \"She hasn\\'t got much time,\" he added quickly, \"you know, with five of us.\"', '\"Go on, have a pasty,\" said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry\\'s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).', '\"What are these?\" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.', '\"They\\'re not really frogs, are they?\" He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.', '\"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is. I\\'m missing Agrippa.\"', '\"What?\"', '\"Oh, of course, you wouldn\\'t know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I\\'ve got about five hundred, but I haven\\'t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\"', \"Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man's face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.\", '\"So this is Dumbledore!\" said Harry.', '\"Don\\'t tell me you\\'d never heard of Dumbledore!\" said Ron. \"Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks Harry turned over his card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\\'s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.', \"Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore's face had disappeared.\", '\"He\\'s gone!\"', '\"Well, you can\\'t expect him to hang around all day,\" said Ron. \"He\\'ll be back. No, I\\'ve got Morgana again and I\\'ve got about six of her... do you want it? You can start collecting.\"', \"Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.\", '\"Help yourself,\" said Harry. \"But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.\"', '\"Do they? What, they don\\'t move at all?\" Ron sounded amazed. \"weird!\"', \"Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.\", \"He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.\", '\"You want to be careful with those,\" Ron warned Harry. \"When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a boogerflavored one once.\"', 'Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.', '\"Bleaaargh -- see? Sprouts.\"', \"They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper.\", 'The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.', 'There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He looked tearful.', '\"Sorry,\" he said, \"but have you seen a toad at all?\"', 'When they shook their heads, he wailed, \"I\\'ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!\"', '\"He\\'ll turn up,\" said Harry.', '\"Yes,\" said the boy miserably. \"Well, if you see him...\"', 'He left.', '\"Don\\'t know why he\\'s so bothered,\" said Ron. \"If I\\'d brought a toad I\\'d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can\\'t talk.\"', \"The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap.\", '\"He might have died and you wouldn\\'t know the difference,\" said Ron in disgust. \"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn\\'t work. I\\'ll show you, look...\"', 'He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.', '\"Unicorn hair\\'s nearly poking out. Anyway He had just raised his \\'wand when the compartment door slid open again.', 'The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.', '\"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville\\'s lost one,\" she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.', '\"We\\'ve already told him we haven\\'t seen it,\" said Ron, but the girl wasn\\'t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.', '\"Oh, are you doing magic? Let\\'s see it, then.\"', 'She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.', '\"Er -- all right.\"', 'He cleared his throat.', '\"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\"', 'He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.', '\"Are you sure that\\'s a real spell?\" said the girl. \"Well, it\\'s not very good, is it? I\\'ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\\'s all worked for me. Nobody in my family\\'s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it\\'s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I\\'ve heard -- I\\'ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough -- I\\'m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you.', 'She said all this very fast.', \"Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all the course books by heart either.\", '\"I\\'m Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered.', '\"Harry Potter,\" said Harry.', '\"Are you really?\" said Hermione. \"I know all about you, of course -- I got a few extra books. for background reading, and you\\'re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.', '\"Am I?\" said Harry, feeling dazed.', '\"Goodness, didn\\'t you know, I\\'d have found out everything I could if it was me,\" said Hermione. \"Do either of you know what house you\\'ll be in? I\\'ve been asking around, and I hope I\\'m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn\\'t be too bad.... Anyway, we\\'d better go and look for Neville\\'s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we\\'ll be there soon.\"', 'And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.', '\"Whatever house I\\'m in, I hope she\\'s not in it,\" said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. \"Stupid spell -- George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.\"', '\"What house are your brothers in?\" asked Harry.', '\"Gryffindor,\" said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \"Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don\\'t know what they\\'ll say if I\\'m not. I don\\'t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\"', '\"That\\'s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\"', '\"Yeah,\" said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.', '\"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers\\' whiskers are a bit lighter,\"', 'said Harry, trying to take Ron\\'s mind off houses. \"So what do your oldest brothers do now that they\\'ve left, anyway?\"', \"Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school.\", '\"Charlie\\'s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill\\'s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\" said Ron. \"Did you hear about Gringotts? It\\'s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don\\'t suppose you get that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security vault.\"', 'Harry stared.', '\"Really? What happened to them?\"', '\"Nothing, that\\'s why it\\'s such big news. They haven\\'t been caught. My dad says it must\\'ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don\\'t think they took anything, that\\'s what\\'s odd. \\'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who\\'s behind it.\"', 'Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \"Voldemort\" without worrying.', '\"What\\'s your Quidditch team?\" Ron asked.', '\"Er -- I don\\'t know any,\" Harry confessed.', '\"What!\" Ron looked dumbfounded. \"Oh, you wait, it\\'s the best game in the world --\" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he\\'d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he\\'d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn\\'t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.', \"Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley.\", '\"Is it true?\" he said. \"They\\'re saying all down the train that Harry Potter\\'s in this compartment. So it\\'s you, is it?\"', '\"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.', '\"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \"And my name\\'s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\"', 'Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco Malfoy looked at him.', '\"Think my name\\'s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.\"', 'He turned back to Harry. \"You\\'ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don\\'t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\"', \"He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.\", '\"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\" he said coolly.', \"Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.\", '\"I\\'d be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly. \"Unless you\\'re a bit politer you\\'ll go the same way as your parents. They didn\\'t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it\\'ll rub off on you.\"', 'Both Harry and Ron stood up.', '\"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair.', '\"Oh, you\\'re going to fight us, are you?\" Malfoy sneered.', '\"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.', '\"But we don\\'t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We\\'ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\"', \"Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\", \"Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle's knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\", '\"What has been going on?\" she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.', 'I think he\\'s been knocked out,\" Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. \"No -- I don\\'t believe it -- he\\'s gone back to sleep-\"', 'And so he had.', '\"You\\'ve met Malfoy before?\"', 'Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.', '\"I\\'ve heard of his family,\" said Ron darkly. \"They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they\\'d been bewitched. My dad doesn\\'t believe it. He says Malfoy\\'s father didn\\'t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\" He turned to Hermione. \"Can we help you with something?\"', '\"You\\'d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\\'ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we\\'re nearly there. You haven\\'t been fighting, have you? You\\'ll be in trouble before we even get there!\"', '\"Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\" said Ron, scowling at her. \"Would you mind leaving while we change?\"', '\"All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\" said Hermione in a sniffy voice. \"And you\\'ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\"', 'Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.', 'He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.', \"Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.\", 'A voice echoed through the train: \"We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes\\' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.\"', \"Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.\", 'The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \"Firs\\' years! Firs\\' years over here! All right there, Harry?\"', \"Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\", '\"C\\'mon, follow me -- any more firs\\' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs\\' years follow me!\"', 'Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.', '\"Ye\\' all get yer firs\\' sight o\\' Hogwarts in a sec,\" Hagrid called over his shoulder, \"jus\\' round this bend here.\"', 'There was a loud \"Oooooh!\"', 'The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take.', 'Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.', '\"No more\\'n four to a boat!\" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. \"Everyone in?\" shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. \"Right then -- FORWARD!\"', 'And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.', '\"Heads down!\" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.', '\"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\" said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.', '\"Trevor!\" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid\\'s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.', 'They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak front door.', '\"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?\"', 'Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.', \"The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross.\", '\"The firs\\' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid.', '\"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\"', \"She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.\", 'They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.', '\"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.', '\"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.', '\"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\"', \"Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.\", '\"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor McGonagall.', '\"Please wait quietly.\"', 'She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.', '\"How exactly do they sort us into houses?\" he asked Ron.', '\"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\"', \"Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived.\", \"He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.\", 'Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air -- several people behind him screamed.', '\"What the --?\"', 'He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance --\"', '\"My dear Friar, haven\\'t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he\\'s not really even a ghost -- I say, what are you all doing here?\"', 'A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.', 'Nobody answered.', '\"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\"', 'A few people nodded mutely.', '\"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old house, you know.\"', '\"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony\\'s about to start.\"', 'Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.', '\"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\"', 'Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.', 'Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.', 'These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.', 'Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.', 'The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, \"Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\"', \"It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.\", \"Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house.\", 'Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing: \"Oh, you may not think I\\'m pretty, But don\\'t judge on what you see, I\\'ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me.', \"You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all.\", \"There's nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can't see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be.\", \"You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you've a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You'll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends.\", 'So put me on! Don\\'t be afraid! And don\\'t get in a flap! You\\'re in safe hands (though I have none) For I\\'m a Thinking Cap!\"', 'The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.', '\"So we\\'ve just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I\\'ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\"', \"Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather alot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\", 'Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.', '\"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\"', 'A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause -- \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat.', 'The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.', '\"Bones, Susan!\"', '\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.', '\"Boot, Terry!\"', '\"RAVENCLAW!\"', 'The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.', '\" Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\"', \"became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.\", '\"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry\\'s imagination, after all he\\'d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.', 'He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.', '\"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\"', '\"HUFFLEPUFF!\"', 'Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.', '\"Granger, Hermione!\"', 'Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.', '\"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat. Ron groaned.', 'A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you\\'re very nervous. What if he wasn\\'t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he\\'d better get back on the train? When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \"MacDougal, Morag.\"', 'Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \"SLYTHERIN!\"', 'Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.', 'There weren\\'t many people left now. \"Moon\" \"Nott\" \"Parkinson\" then a pair of twin girls, \"Patil\" and \"Patil\" then \"Perks, Sally-Anne\" and then, at last -- \"Potter, Harry!\"', 'As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.', '\"Potter, did she say?\"', 'The Harry Potter?\"', 'The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.', 'Hmm,\" said a small voice in his ear. \"Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There\\'s talent, A my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\\'s interesting....', 'So where shall I put you?\"', 'Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.', '\"Not Slytherin, eh?\" said the small voice. \"Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it\\'s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you\\'re sure -- better be GRYFFINDOR!\"', 'Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \"We got Potter! We got Potter!\" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he\\'d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he\\'d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.', \"He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.\", 'And now there were only three people left to be sorted. \"Thomas, Dean,\"', 'a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.', '\"Turpin, Lisa,\" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\\'s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR!\"', 'Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.', '\"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry as \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.', 'Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.', 'Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.', '\"Welcome,\" he said. \"Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! \"Thank you!\"', \"He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not.\", '\"Is he -- a bit mad?\" he asked Percy uncertainly.', '\"Mad?\" said Percy airily. \"He\\'s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\"', \"Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.\", \"The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.\", 'It was all delicious.', '\"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak, \"Can\\'t you --?\"', 'I haven\\'t eaten for nearly four hundred years,\" said the ghost. \"I don\\'t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don\\'t think I\\'ve in troduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\"', '\"I know who you are!\" said Ron suddenly. \"My brothers told me about you -- you\\'re Nearly Headless Nick!\"', '\"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy --\" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.', '\"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\"', \"Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted.\", '\"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you\\'re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron\\'s becoming almost unbearable -- he\\'s the Slytherin ghost.\"', \"Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\", '\"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest.', '\"I\\'ve never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.', 'When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- \\x93', 'As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.', '\"I\\'m half-and-half,\" said Seamus. \"Me dad\\'s a Muggle. Mom didn\\'t tell him she was a witch \\'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\"', 'The others laughed.', '\"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron.', '\"Well, my gran brought me up and she\\'s a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\"', 'On Harry\\'s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there\\'s so much to learn, I\\'m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it\\'s supposed to be very difficult-\"; \"You\\'ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- \").', 'Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.', 'Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.', \"It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead.\", '\"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head.', '\"What is it?\" asked Percy.', '\"N-nothing.\"', \"The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all.\", '\"Who\\'s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy.', '\"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\\'s looking so nervous, that\\'s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn\\'t want to -- everyone knows he\\'s after Quirrell\\'s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\"', \"Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.\", 'At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.', '\"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.', '\"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\"', \"Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.\", '\"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.', '\"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.', '\"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\"', 'Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.', '\"He\\'s not serious?\" he muttered to Percy.', '\"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It\\'s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we\\'re not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest\\'s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\"', '\"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers\\' smiles had become rather fixed.', 'Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.', '\"Everyone pick their favorite tune,\" said Dumbledore, \"and off we go!\"', 'And the school bellowed: \"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they\\'re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we\\'ve forgot, just do your best, we\\'ll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.', 'Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.', 'Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.', '\"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\"', \"The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\", 'A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.', '\"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He raised his voice, \"Peeves -- show yourself\"', 'A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.', '\"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\"', 'There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.', '\"Oooooooh!\" he said, with an evil cackle. \"Ickle Firsties! What fun!\"', 'He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.', '\"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron\\'ll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked Percy.', \"Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\", '\"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again.', '\"The Bloody Baron\\'s the only one who can control him, he won\\'t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\"', 'At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.', '\"Password?\" she said. \"Caput Draconis,\" said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.', 'Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.', '\" Great food, isn\\'t it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.', '\"Get off, Scabbers! He\\'s chewing my sheets.\"', \"Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\", \"Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\", \"He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all.\", 'There, look.\"', '\"Where?\"', '\"Next to the tall kid with the red hair.\"', '\"Wearing the glasses?\"', '\"Did you see his face?\"', '\"Did you see his scar?\"', 'Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.', \"Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\", \"There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\", 'The ghosts didn\\'t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \"GOT YOUR CONK!\"', \"Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.\", \"Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\", 'And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.', 'They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.', 'Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.', \"Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.\", \"Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.\", '\"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\" she said. \"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\"', \"Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.\", 'After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.', \"The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story.\", 'For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.', \"Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.\", 'Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.', '\"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.', '\"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron. \"Snape\\'s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we\\'ll be able to see if it\\'s true.\"', '\"Wish McGonagall favored us, \" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn\\'t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.', 'Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.', \"Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.\", \"Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\", 'It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.', \"At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him.\", 'Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.', \"Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.\", '\"Ah, Yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity.\"', \"Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth.\", 'They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.', '\"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\\'t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren\\'t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\"', \"More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.\", '\"Potter!\" said Snape suddenly. \"What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\"', \"Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air.\", '\"I don\\'t know, sit,\" said Harry.', \"Snape's lips curled into a sneer.\", '\"Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn\\'t everything.\"', \"He ignored Hermione's hand.\", '\"Let\\'s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\"', \"Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.\", '\"I don\\'t know, sit.\" \"Thought you wouldn\\'t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys\\', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? Snape was still ignoring Hermione\\'s quivering hand.', '\"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\"', 'At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.', '\"I don\\'t know,\" said Harry quietly. \"I think Hermione does, though, why don\\'t you try her?\"', \"A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked.\", 'Snape, however, was not pleased.', '\"Sit down,\" he snapped at Hermione. \"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren\\'t you all copying that down?\"', 'There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\"', \"Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.\", '\"Idiot boy!\" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. \"I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\"', 'Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.', '\"Take him up to the hospital wing,\" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.', '\"You -- Potter -- why didn\\'t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he\\'d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That\\'s another point you\\'ve lost for Gryffindor.\"', 'This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.', '\"Doi* push it,\" he muttered, \"I\\'ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.\"', 'As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\\'s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He\\'d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? \"Cheer up,\"', 'said Ron, \"Snape\\'s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\"', 'At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.', 'When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid\\'s voice rang out, saying, \"Back, Fang -- back.\"', \"Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.\", '\"Hang on,\" he said. \"Back, Fang.\"', 'He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.', 'There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.', '\"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.', '\"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.', '\"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\\'s freckles. I spent half me life chasin\\' yer twin brothers away from the forest.\"', \"The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes.\", 'Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch \"that old git.\"', '\"An\\' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I\\'d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D\\'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can\\'t get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it.\"', \"Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\", '\"But he seemed to really hate me.\"', '\"Rubbish!\" said Hagrid. \"Why should he?\"', \"Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that.\", '\"How\\'s yer brother Charlie?\" Hagrid asked Ron. \"I liked him a lot -- great with animals.\"', \"Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet: GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\", 'Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.', '\"But we\\'re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what\\'s good for you,\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.', \"Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.\", '\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might\\'ve been happening while we were there!\"', \"Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan.\", 'Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.', '\"Typical,\" said Harry darkly. \"Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\"', 'He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.', '\"You don\\'t know that you\\'ll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron reasonably. \"Anyway, I know Malfoy\\'s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that\\'s all talk.\"', \"Malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom.\", \"Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.\", \"Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.\", \"Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book -- not that she hadn't tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.\", \"Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.\", 'A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.', '\"It\\'s a Remembrall!\" he explained. \"Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there\\'s something you\\'ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh...\" His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \"You\\'ve forgotten something...\"', \"Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.\", 'Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.', '\"What\\'s going on?\"', '\"Malfoy\\'s got my Remembrall, Professor.\"', 'Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.', '\"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.', 'At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.', 'The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.', 'Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.', '\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\"', 'Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.', '\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the front, \"and say \\'Up!\"\\' \"UPF everyone shouted.', \"Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\", 'Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.', \"Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years.\", '\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three -- two --\"', \"But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips.\", '\"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and -- WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.', 'Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.', '\"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy -- it\\'s all right, up you get.\".', 'She turned to the rest of the class.', '\"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you\\'ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say \\'Quidditch.\\' Come on, dear.\"', 'Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.', 'No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.', '\"Did you see his face, the great lump?\"', 'The other Slytherins joined in.', '\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil.', '\"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. \"Never thought you\\'d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\"', '\"Look!\" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. \"It\\'s that stupid thing Longbottom\\'s gran sent him.\"', 'The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.', '\"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.', 'Malfoy smiled nastily.', '\"I think I\\'ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree?\"', '\"Give it here!\" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn\\'t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \"Come and get it, Potter!\"', 'Harry grabbed his broom.', '\"No!\" shouted Hermione Granger. \"Madam Hooch told us not to move -- you\\'ll get us all into trouble.\"', \"Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\", 'He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.', '\"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or I\\'ll knock you off that broom!\" \"Oh, yeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.', 'Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.', '\"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called.', 'The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.', '\"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.', 'Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.', '\"HARRY POTTER!\"', \"His heart sank faster than he'd just dived.

Potter, follow me, now.\"', \"Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag.\", 'Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.', '\"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\"', 'Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?

Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.', '\"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I\\'ve found you a Seeker.\"', \"Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\", '\"Are you serious, Professor?\"', '\"Absolutely,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"The boy\\'s a natural.', 'I\\'ve never seen anything like it.

He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.\", '\"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\" Professor McGonagall told Wood. \"Didn\\'t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn\\'t have done it.\"', 'Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.', '\"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\" he asked excitedly.', '\"Wood\\'s captain of the Gryffindor team,\" Professor McGonagall explained.', '\"He\\'s just the build for a Seeker, too,\" said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. \"Light -- speedy -- we\\'ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I\\'d say.\"', \"I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year.\", 'Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn\\'t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks....\"', 'Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.', '\"I want to hear you\\'re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.\"', 'Then she suddenly smiled.', '\"Your father would have been proud,\" she said. \"He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.\"', '\"You\\'re joking.\"', \"It was dinnertime.

Catching the look on Harry\\'s face, he added quickly, \"But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy\\'ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\"', '\"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\"', '\"Throw it away and punch him on the nose,\" Ron suggested. \"Excuse me.\"', 'They both looked up.

He couldn't miss it.\", '\"Half-past eleven,\" Ron muttered at last, \"we\\'d better go.\"', 'They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \"I can\\'t believe you\\'re going to do this, Harry.\"', 'A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.', '\"You!\" said Ron furiously. \"Go back to bed!\"', '\"I almost told your brother,\" Hermione snapped, \"Percy -- he\\'s a prefect, he\\'d put a stop to this.\"', \"Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering.\", '\"Come on,\" he said to Ron.

This is the end!\" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves\\'s shouts.', '\"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry\\'s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \\'Alohomora!\"', 'The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.', '\"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\"', '\"Say \\'please.\"\\' \"Don\\'t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\"', '\"Shan\\'t say nothing if you don\\'t say please,\" said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.', '\"All right -please.\"', '\"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\\'t say nothing if you didn\\'t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.', '\"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \"I think we\\'ll be okay -- get off, Neville!\" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry\\'s bathrobe for the last minute. \"What?\"', \"Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.\", \"They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.\", 'They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads.', 'Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.', \"It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\", \"Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he'd take Filch.\", \"They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\", '\"Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.', '\"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.', \"It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.\", '\"What do they think they\\'re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one does.\"', 'Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \"You don\\'t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \"Didn\\'t you see what it was standing on.', '\"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn\\'t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\"', '\"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\\'s obviously guarding something.\"', 'She stood up, glaring at them.', 'I hope you\\'re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled. Now, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'m going to bed.\"', 'Ron stared after her, his mouth open.', '\"No, we don\\'t mind,\" he said. \"You\\'d think we dragged her along, wouldn\\'t you.', 'But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.', 'It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.', \"Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.\", 'Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. \"It\\'s either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron.', '\"Or both,\" said Harry.', \"But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\", 'Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.', 'Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.', \"As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\", 'Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.', \"It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session.\", 'Professor McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.', '\"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously. \"I\\'ve never even touched one.\"', 'They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.', '\"That\\'s a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \"You\\'ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren\\'t allowed them.\"', \"Ron couldn't resist it.\", '\"It\\'s not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"it\\'s a Nimbus Two Thousand.', 'What did you say you\\'ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\" Ron grinned at Harry. \"Comets look flashy, but they\\'re not in the same league as the Nimbus.\"', '\"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\\'t afford half the handle,\" Malfoy snapped back. \"I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\"', \"Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow.\", '\"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked.', '\"Potter\\'s been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly.', '\"Yes, yes, that\\'s right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.', '\"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?\"', '\"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy\\'s face. \"And it\\'s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\\'ve got it,\" he added.', 'Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy\\'s obvious rage and confusion. \"Well, it\\'s true,\" Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \"If he hadn\\'t stolen Neville\\'s Remembrall I wouln\\'t be on the team....\"', '\"So I suppose you think that\\'s a reward for breaking rules?\" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry\\'s hand.', '\"I thought you weren\\'t speaking to us?\" said Harry.', '\"Yes, don\\'t stop now,\" said Ron, \"it\\'s doing us so much good.\"', 'Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.', \"Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\", '\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\\'s bedspread.', 'Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.', \"As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\", 'Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.', '\"Hey, Potter, come down!\\' Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.', '\"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \"I see what McGonagall meant... you really are a natural. I\\'m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you\\'ll be joining team practice three times a week.\"', 'He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.', '\"Right,\" said Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it\\'s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side.', 'Three of them are called Chasers.\"', '\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.', '\"This ball\\'s called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. \"The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\"', '\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\"', 'Harry recited. \"So -- that\\'s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn\\'t it?\"', '\"What\\'s basketball?\" said Wood curiously. \"Never mind,\" said Harry quickly.', '\"Now, there\\'s another player on each side who\\'s called the Keeper -I\\'m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\"', '\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.', '\"I\\'ll show you now,\" said Wood. \"Take this.\"', 'He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.', '\"I\\'m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said. \"These two are the Bludgers.\"', 'He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.', '\"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.', \"At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\", '\"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That\\'s why you have two Beaters on each team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it\\'s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So -- think you\\'ve got all that?\"', '\"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\" Harry reeled off.', '\"Very good,\" said Wood.', '\"Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\" Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.', '\"Never at Hogwarts. We\\'ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That\\'s you. And you don\\'t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers unless they crack my head open.\"', '\"Don\\'t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I mean, they\\'re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\"', 'Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.', 'Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.', '\"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it\\'s the most important ball of the lot. It\\'s very hard to catch because it\\'s so fast and difficult to see. It\\'s the Seeker\\'s job to catch it. You\\'ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team\\'s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That\\'s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages -- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. \"Well, that\\'s it -- any questions?\"', 'Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.', '\"We won\\'t practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \"it\\'s too dark, we might lose it. Let\\'s try you out with a few of these.\"', 'He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.', \"Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.\", '\"That Quidditch cup\\'ll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn\\'t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn\\'t gone off chasing dragons.\"', \"Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\", \"On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.\", '\"Now, don\\'t forget that nice wrist movement we\\'ve been practicing!\"', 'squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said \\'s\\' instead of \\'f\\' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\"', 'It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.', \"Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.\", '\"Wingardium Leviosa!\" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.', '\"You\\'re saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap. \"It\\'s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the \\'gar\\' nice and long.\"', '\"You do it, then, if you\\'re so clever,\" Ron snarled.', 'Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"', 'Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.', '\"Oh, well done!\" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \"Everyone see here, Miss Granger\\'s done it!\"', 'Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \"It\\'s no wonder no one can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \"she\\'s a nightmare, honestly. \\x93', 'Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione.', 'Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears.', '\"I think she heard you.\"', '\"So?\" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \"She must\\'ve noticed she\\'s got no friends.\"', \"Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone.\", 'Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.', 'A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.', 'Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.', 'Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\\'s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \"Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know.\"', 'He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.', \"There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.\", '\"Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\"', 'Percy was in his element.', '\"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I\\'m a prefect!\"', '\"How could a troll get in?\" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.', '\"Don\\'t ask me, they\\'re supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron. \"Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\"', 'They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.', \"As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.\", '\"I\\'ve just thought -- Hermione.\"', '\"What about her?\"', '\"She doesn\\'t know about the troll.\"', 'Ron bit his lip.', '\"Oh, all right,\" he snapped. \"But Percy\\'d better not see us.\"', \"Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.\", '\"Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.', 'Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.', '\"What\\'s he doing?\" Harry whispered. \"Why isn\\'t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\"', '\"Search me.\"', \"Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps.\", '\"He\\'s heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.', '\"Can you smell something?\"', 'Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.', 'And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.', 'It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.', 'The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.', '\"The keys in the lock,\" Harry muttered. \"We could lock it in.\"', '\"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously.', \"They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.\", '\\'Yes!\"', \"Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up.\", '\"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.', '\"It\\'s the girls\\' bathroom!\" Harry gasped.', '\"Hermione!\" they said together.', 'It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.', 'Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.', '\"Confuse it!\" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.', 'The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.', '\"Oy, pea-brain!\" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn\\'t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.', '\"Come on, run, run!\" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn\\'t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.', 'The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.', \"Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.\", 'Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.', 'Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"', \"The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head.

Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.', 'It was Hermione who spoke first.', '\"Is it -- dead?\"', 'I don\\'t think so,\" said Harry, I think it\\'s just been knocked out.\"', \"He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.\", '\"Urgh -- troll boogers.\"', \"He wiped it on the troll's trousers.\", 'A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.', \"They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\", 'Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white.', \"Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind.\", '\"What on earth were you thinking of?\" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice.

It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\"', \"Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.\", '\"Well -- in that case...\" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\"', 'Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble.

Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \"Thanks,\" and hurried off to get plates.', \"But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\", 'As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost.

On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.', \"Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.\", \"It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do.

The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.\", \"They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard.

So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.\", \"It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas.\", \"Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he'd ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.\", 'When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.', '\"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\" Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.', '\"Nah, I\\'m all right, thanks, Ron.\"', '\"Would you mind moving out of the way?\" came Malfoys cold drawl from behind them. \"Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley?

Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.', '\"How many days you got left until yer holidays?\" Hagrid asked.', '\"Just one,\" said Hermione. \"And that reminds me -Harry, Ron, we\\'ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\"', '\"Oh yeah, you\\'re right,\" said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.', '\"The library?\" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. \"Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren\\'t yeh?\"', '\"Oh, we\\'re not working,\" Harry told him brightly. \"Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we\\'ve been trying to find out who he is.\"', '\"You what?\" Hagrid looked shocked. \"Listen here -- I\\'ve told yeh -- drop it.

The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.\", \"Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\", '\"What are you looking for, boy?\"', '\"Nothing,\" said Harry.', 'Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.', '\"You\\'d better get out, then. Go on -- out!\"', \"Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to.\", \"Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.\", 'Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.', 'They went off to lunch.', '\"You will keep looking while I\\'m away, won\\'t you?\" said Hermione. \"And send me an owl if you find anything.\"', '\"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said Ron.', '\"It\\'d be safe to ask them.\"', '\"Very safe, as they\\'re both dentists,\" said Hermione.', \"Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows -- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work.\", \"Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered.\", \"Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.\", 'Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn\\'t trust him at all. He wasn\\'t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \"Don\\'t send me there, can\\'t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.\" On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.', 'When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.', '\"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.', '\"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I\\'ve got some presents!\"', '\"What did you expect, turnips?\" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry\\'s.', 'Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it -- it sounded a bit like an owl.', 'A second, very small parcel contained a note.', 'We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.', '\"That\\'s friendly,\" said Harry.', 'Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.', '\"Weird!\" he said, \\'NMat a shape! This is money?\"', '\"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \"Hagrid and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?\"', '\"I think I know who that one\\'s from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \"My mom. I told her you didn\\'t expect any presents and -- oh, no,\" he groaned, \"she\\'s made you a Weasley sweater.\"', 'Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.', '\"Every year she makes us a sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping his own, \"and mine\\'s always maroon.\"', '\"That\\'s really nice of her,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.', 'His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.', 'This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.', 'Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.', '\"I\\'ve heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he\\'d gotten from Hermione. \"If that\\'s what I think it is -- they\\'re really rare, and really valuable.\"', '\"What is it?\"', 'Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.', '\"It\\'s an invisibility cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \"I\\'m sure it is -- try it on.\"', 'Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.', '\"It is! Look down!\"', 'Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.', '\"There\\'s a note!\" said Ron suddenly. \"A note fell out of it!\"', 'Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.', 'A Very Merry Christmas to you.', 'There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak.', '\"I\\'d give anything for one of these,\" he said. \"Anything. What\\'s the matter?\"', '\"Nothing,\" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father? Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn\\'t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.', '\"Merry Christmas!\"', '\"Hey, look -- Harry\\'s got a Weasley sweater, too!\"', 'Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.', '\"Harry\\'s is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry\\'s sweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you\\'re not family.\"', '\"Why aren\\'t you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded. \"Come on, get it on, they\\'re lovely and warm.\"', '\"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.', '\"You haven\\'t got a letter on yours,\" George observed. \"I suppose she thinks you don\\'t forget your name. But we\\'re not stupid -- we know we\\'re called Gred and Forge.\"', '\"What\\'s all th is noise.', 'Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.', '\"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\\'re all wearing ours, even Harry got one.\"', '\"I -- don\\'t -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.', '\"And you\\'re not sitting with the prefects today, either,\" said George. \"Christmas is a time for family.\"', 'They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.', \"Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.\", \"Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.\", 'When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.', \"The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.\", \"Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.\", \"After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge.\", \"It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.\", \"Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.\", \"His father's... this had been his father's. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.\", 'He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.', 'Use it well.', 'Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.', \"Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back -- his father's cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he wanted to use it alone.\", 'He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.', '\"Who\\'s there?\" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.', \"Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.\", 'He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked.', 'The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.', 'The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.', \"They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all.\", \"One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.\", 'He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.', \"A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears.\", \"He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.\", '\"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody\\'s been in the library Restricted Section.\"', 'Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section? Well, they can\\'t be far, we\\'ll catch them.\"', \"Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak didn't stop him from being solid.\", 'He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.', \"It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.\", 'It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.', 'He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.', 'But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.', \"There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the others existed only in the mirror.\", \"She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did.\", 'Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.', '\"Mom?\" he whispered. \"Dad?\"', \"They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\", 'The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.', 'How long he stood there, he didn\\'t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn\\'t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother\\'s face, whispered, \"I\\'ll come back,\"', 'and hurried from the room.', '\"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly.', '\"You can come tonight, I\\'m going back, I want to show you the mirror.', '\"I\\'d like to see your mom and dad,\" Ron said eagerly.', '\"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\\'ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\"', '\"You can see them any old time,\" said Ron. \"Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren\\'t you eating anything?\"', 'Harry couldn\\'t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn\\'t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? \"Are you all right?\" said Ron. \"You look odd.\"', \"What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.\", '\"I\\'m freezing,\" said Ron. \"Let\\'s forget it and go back.\"', '\"No!\" Harry hissed. I know it\\'s here somewhere.\"', 'They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.', '\"It\\'s here -- just here -- yes!\"', 'They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.', 'There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.', '\"See?\" Harry whispered.', '\"I can\\'t see anything.\"', '\"Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them....\"', '\"I can only see you.\"', '\"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\"', \"Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\", 'Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.', '\"Look at me!\" he said.', '\"Can you see all your family standing around you?\"', '\"No -- I\\'m alone -- but I\\'m different -- I look older -- and I\\'m head boy!\"', '\"What?\"', '\"I am -- I\\'m wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I\\'m holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I\\'m Quidditch captain, too.', 'Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.', '\"Do you think this mirror shows the future?\"', '\"How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look --\"', '\"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\"', '\"You\\'re only holding the Quidditch cup, what\\'s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.\"', '\"Don\\'t push me --\"', 'A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.', \"They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking.\", '\"Quick!\"', 'Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing -- did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left.', '\"This isn\\'t safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.', 'Come on.\"', 'And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.', \"The snow still hadn't melted the next morning.\", '\"Want to play chess, Harry?\" said Ron.', '\"No.\"', '\"Why don\\'t we go down and visit Hagrid?\"', '\"No... you go...\"', '\"I know what you\\'re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don\\'t go back tonight.\"', '\"Why not?\"', '\"I dunno, I\\'ve just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you\\'ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can\\'t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?\"', '\"You sound like Hermione.\"', '\"I\\'m serious, Harry, don\\'t go.\"', \"But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.\", \"That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone.\", 'And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.', 'Except -- \"So -- back again, Harry?\"', \"Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.\", '\" -- I didn\\'t see you, sir.\"', '\"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.', '\"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\"', '\"I didn\\'t know it was called that, Sir.\"', '\"But I expect you\\'ve realized by now what it does?\"', '\"It -- well -- it shows me my family --\"', '\"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.\"', '\"How did you know --?\"', '\"I don\\'t need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently.', '\"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\"', 'Harry shook his head.', '\"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\"', 'Harry thought. Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want...', 'whatever we want...\"', '\"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.', '\"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don\\'t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\"', 'Harry stood up.', '\"Sir -- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\"', '\"Obviously, you\\'ve just done so,\" Dumbledore smiled. \"You may ask me one more thing, however.\"', '\"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\"', '\"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\"', 'Harry stared.', '\"One can never have enough socks,\" said Dumbledore. \"Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn\\'t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.\"', 'It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.', \"Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.\", '\"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said Ron, when Harry told him about these drearns.', 'Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If Filch had caught you!\"), and disappointment that he hadn\\'t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.', \"They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li- brary book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere.\", 'Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.', \"Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.\", \"Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He'd just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.\", '\"Will you stop messing around!\" he yelled. \"That\\'s exactly the sort of thing that\\'ll lose us the match! Snape\\'s refereeing this time, and he\\'ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\"', 'George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.', '\"Snape\\'s refereeing?\" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \"When\\'s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He\\'s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.\"', 'The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.', '\"It\\'s not my fault,\" said Wood. \"We\\'ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn\\'t got an excuse to pick on us.\"', 'Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....', 'The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.', '\"Don\\'t talk to me for a moment,\" said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, \"I need to concen --\" He caught sight of Harry\\'s face. \"What\\'s the matter with you? You look terrible.\"', \"Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\", '\"Don\\'t play,\" said Hermione at once.', '\"Say you\\'re ill,\" said Ron.', '\"Pretend to break your leg,\" Hermione suggested.', '\"Really break your leg,\" said Ron.', '\"I can\\'t,\" said Harry. \"There isn\\'t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can\\'t play at all.\"', \"At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.\", 'Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville\\'s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \"What happened?\" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.', '\"Malfoy,\" said Neville shakily. \"I met him outside the library. He said he\\'d been looking for someone to practice that on.\"', '\"Go to Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione urged Neville. \"Report him!\"', 'Neville shook his head.', '\"I don\\'t want more trouble,\" he mumbled.', '\"You\\'ve got to stand up to him, Neville!\" said Ron. \"He\\'s used to walking all over people, but that\\'s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.\"', '\"There\\'s no need to tell me I\\'m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy\\'s already done that,\" Neville choked out.', 'Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.', '\"You\\'re worth twelve of Malfoy,\" Harry said. \"The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn\\'t it? And where\\'s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\"', \"Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.\", '\"Thanks, Harry... I think I\\'ll go to bed.... D\\'you want the card, you collect them, don\\'t you?\"', 'As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.', '\"Dumbledore again,\" he said, \"He was the first one I ever-\"', 'He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.', '\"I\\'ve found him!\" he whispered. \"I\\'ve found Flamel! I told you I\\'d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here -- listen to this: \\'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\\'s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel\\'!\"', \"Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\", '\"Stay there!\" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls\\' dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.', '\"I never thought to look in here!\" she whispered excitedly. \"I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\"', '\"Light?\" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she\\'d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.', 'At last she found what she was looking for.', '\"I knew it! I knew it!\"', '\"Are we allowed to speak yet?\" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.', '\"Nicolas Flamel,\" she whispered dramatically, \"is the only known maker of the Sorcerer\\'s Stone!\"', \"This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected.\", '\"The what?\" said Harry and Ron.', '\"Oh, honestly, don\\'t you two read? Look -- read that, there.\"', \"She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.\", \"There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).\", '\"See?\" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \"The dog must be guarding Flamel\\'s Sorcerer\\'s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they\\'re friends and he knew someone was after it, that\\'s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\"', '\"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\" said Harry. \"No wonder Snape\\'s after it! Anyone would want it.\"', '\"And no wonder we couldn\\'t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\" said Ron. \"He\\'s not exactly recent if he\\'s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?\"', \"The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one. It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.\", '\"I\\'m going to play,\" he told Ron and Hermione. \"If I don\\'t, all the Slytherins will think I\\'m just too scared to face Snape. I\\'ll show them... it\\'ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\"', '\"Just as long as we\\'re not wiping you off the field,\" said Hermione.', \"As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee? Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the Sorcerer's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\", \"Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\", \"Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\", '\"Now, don\\'t forget, it\\'s Locomotor Mortis,\" Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.', '\"I know,\" Ron snapped. \"Don\\'t nag.\"', 'Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.', '\"Don\\'t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it\\'s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.\"', '\"The whole school\\'s out there!\" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. \"Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore\\'s come to watch!\"', \"Harry's heart did a somersault.\", '\"Dumbledore?\" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right.', 'There was no mistaking that silver beard.', 'Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.', 'Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.', '\"I\\'ve never seen Snape look so mean,\" he told Hermione. \"Look -they\\'re off Ouch!\"', 'Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.', '\"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn\\'t see you there.\"', 'Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.', '\"Wonder how long Potter\\'s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\"', \"Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\", '\"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \"It\\'s people they feel sorry for. See, there\\'s Potter, who\\'s got no parents, then there\\'s the Weasleys, who\\'ve got no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you\\'ve got no brains.\"', 'Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.', '\"I\\'m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\" he stammered.', 'Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, \"You tell him, Neville.\"', '\"Longbottom, if brains were gold you\\'d be poorer than Weasley, and that\\'s saying something.\"', \"Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.\", '\"I\\'m warning you, Malfoy -- one more word \"Ron!\" said Hermione suddenly, \"Harry --\"', '\"What? Where?\"', 'Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.', '\"You\\'re in luck, Weasley, Potter\\'s obviously spotted some money on the ground!\" said Malfoy.', 'Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.', '\"Come on, Harry!\" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn\\'t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.', 'Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.', 'The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.', '\"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game\\'s over! Harry\\'s won! We\\'ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.', \"Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn't believe it. He'd done it -- the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face.\", '\"Well done,\" said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear.', '\"Nice to see you haven\\'t been brooding about that mirror... been keeping busy... excellent...\"', 'Snape spat bitterly on the ground.', \"Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now -- no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.\", 'Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.', \"Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape....\", 'And speaking of Snape...', \"A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure's prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on? Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.\", \"The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.\", \"He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell was there, too.\", \"Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.\", '\"... d-don\\'t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus...\"', '\"Oh, I thought we\\'d keep this private,\" said Snape, his voice icy.', '\"Students aren\\'t supposed to know about the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, after all.\"', 'Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him.', '\"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid\\'s yet?\"', '\"B-b-but Severus, I --\"', '\"You don\\'t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\" said Snape, taking a step toward him.', '\"I-I don\\'t know what you \"You know perfectly well what I mean.\"', 'An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \"-- your little bit of hocus-pocus.', 'I\\'m waiting.\"', '\"B-but I d-d-don\\'t --\"', '\"Very well,\" Snape cut in. \"We\\'ll have another little chat soon, when you\\'ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.\"', 'He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.', '\"Harry, where have you been?\" Hermione squeaked.', '\"We won! You won! We won!\" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \"And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He\\'s still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he\\'ll be all right - talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone\\'s waiting for you in the common room, we\\'re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.\"', '\"Never mind that now,\" said Harry breathlessly. \"Let\\'s find an empty room, you wait \\'til you hear this....\"', \"He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he'd seen and heard.\", '\"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, and Snape\\'s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell\\'s \\'hocus pocuss-- I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through --\"', '\"So you mean the Stone\\'s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?\" said Hermione in alarm.', '\"It\\'ll be gone by next Tuesday,\" said Ron.', \"Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look as though he'd cracked yet.\", \"Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter.\", \"Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes.\", \"Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.\", '\"Hermione, the exams are ages away.\"', '\"Ten weeks,\" Hermione snapped. \"That\\'s not ages, that\\'s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.\"', '\"But we\\'re not six hundred years old,\" Ron reminded her. \"Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it A.\"', '\"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They\\'re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don\\'t know what\\'s gotten into me....\"', \"Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.\", '\"I\\'ll never remember this,\" Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they\\'d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.', 'Harry, who was looking up \"Dittany\" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn\\'t look up until he heard Ron say, \"Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?\"', 'Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.', '\"Jus\\' lookin\\',\" he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. \"An\\' what\\'re you lot up ter?\" He looked suddenly suspicious. \"Yer not still lookin\\' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\" \"Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,\" said Ron impressively. \"And we know what that dog\\'s guarding, it\\'s a Sorcerer\\'s St --\"', '\"Shhhh!\" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.', '\"Don\\' go shoutin\\' about it, what\\'s the matter with yeh?\"', '\"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\" said Harry, \"about what\\'s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy --\"', '\"SHHHH!\" said Hagrid again. \"Listen - come an\\' see me later, I\\'m not promisin\\' I\\'ll tell yeh anythin\\', mind, but don\\' go rabbitin\\' about it in here, students aren\\' s\\'pposed ter know. They\\'ll think I\\'ve told yeh --\"', '\"See you later, then,\" said Harry.', 'Hagrid shuffled off.', '\"What was he hiding behind his back?\" said Hermione thoughtfully.', '\"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\"', '\"I\\'m going to see what section he was in,\" said Ron, who\\'d had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.', '\"Dragons!\" he whispered. \"Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper\\'s Guide.\"', '\"Hagrid\\'s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, \" said Harry.', '\"But it\\'s against our laws,\" said Ron. \"Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks\\' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It\\'s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we\\'re keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway, you can\\'t tame dragons, it\\'s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie\\'s got off wild ones in Romania.\"', '\"But there aren\\'t wild dragons in Britain?\" said Harry.', '\"Of course there are,\" said Ron. \"Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you.', 'Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who\\'ve spotted them, to make them forget.\"', '\"So what on earths Hagrid up to?\" said Hermione.', 'When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\\'s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called \"Who is it?\" before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.', 'It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.', '\"So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin\\'?\"', '\"Yes,\" said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. \"We were wondering if you could tell us what\\'s guarding the Sorcerer\\'s Stone apart from Fluffy.\"', 'Hagrid frowned at him.', '\"0\\' course I cant, he said. \"Number one, I don\\' know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn\\' tell yeh if I could. That Stone\\'s here fer a good reason. It Was almost stolen outta Gringotts - I s\\'ppose yeh\\'ve worked that out an\\' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou\\' Fluffy.\"', '\"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,\" said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid\\'s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. \"We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.\" Hermione went on. \"We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.\"', \"Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.\", '\"Well, I don\\' s\\'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let\\'s see... he borrowed Fluffy from me... then some o\\' the teachers did enchantments...', 'Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall --\" he ticked them off on his fingers, \"Professor Quirrell -- an\\' Dumbledore himself did somethin\\', o\\' course. Hang on, I\\'ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.\"', '\"Snape?\"', '\"Yeah -- yer not still on abou\\' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he\\'s not about ter steal it.\"', \"Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything -- except, it seemed, Quirrell's spell and how to get past Fluffy.\", '\"You\\'re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren\\'t you, Hagrid?\" said Harry anxiously. \"And you wouldn\\'t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?\"', '\"Not a soul knows except me an\\' Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid proudly.', '\"Well, that\\'s something,\" Harry muttered to the others. \"Hagrid, can we have a window open? I\\'m boiling.\"', '\"Can\\'t, Harry, sorry,\" said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.', '\"Hagrid -- what\\'s that?\"', 'But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.', '\"Ah,\" said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \"That\\'s er...\"', '\"Where did you get it, Hagrid?\" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. \"It must\\'ve cost you a fortune.\"', '\"Won it,\" said Hagrid. \"Las\\' night. I was down in the village havin\\' a few drinks an\\' got into a game o\\' cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\"', '\"But what are you going to do with it when it\\'s hatched?\" said Hermione.', '\"Well, I\\'ve bin doin\\' some readin\\' , said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. \"Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit -- it\\'s a bit outta date, o\\' course, but it\\'s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, \\'cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an\\' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o\\' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An\\' see here -- how ter recognize diff\\'rent eggs -- what I got there\\'s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They\\'re rare, them.\"', \"He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't.\", '\"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,\" she said.', \"But Hagrid wasn't listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.\", 'So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.', '\"Wonder what it\\'s like to have a peaceful life,\" Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.', 'Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.', \"He had written only two words: It's hatching.\", \"Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn't hear of it.\", '\"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?\"', '\"We\\'ve got lessons, we\\'ll get into trouble, and that\\'s nothing to what Hagrid\\'s going to be in when someone finds out what he\\'s doing --\"', '\"Shut up!\" Harry whispered.', \"Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all.\", \"Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.\", '\"It\\'s nearly out.\" He ushered them inside.', 'The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.', 'They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.', \"All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.\", 'It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.', '\"Isn\\'t he beautiful?\" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon\\'s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.', '\"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!\" said Hagrid.', '\"Hagrid,\" said Hermione, \"how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?\"', 'Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face -- he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.', '\"What\\'s the matter?\"', '\"Someone was lookin\\' through the gap in the curtains -- it\\'s a kid -- he\\'s runnin\\' back up ter the school.\"', 'Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him.', 'Malfoy had seen the dragon.', \"Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\", '\"Just let him go,\" Harry urged. \"Set him free.\"', '\"I can\\'t,\" said Hagrid. \"He\\'s too little. He\\'d die.\"', \"They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn't been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\", '\"I\\'ve decided to call him Norbert,\" said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. \"He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where\\'s Mommy?\"', '\"He\\'s lost his marbles,\" Ron muttered in Harry\\'s ear.', '\"Hagrid,\" said Harry loudly, \"give it two weeks and Norbert\\'s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\"', 'Hagrid bit his lip.', '\"I -- I know I can\\'t keep him forever, but I can\\'t jus\\' dump him, I can\\'t.\"', 'Harry suddenly turned to Ron. Charlie, he said.', '\"You\\'re losing it, too,\" said Ron. \"I\\'m Ron, remember?\"', '\"No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons.', 'We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!\"', '\"Brilliant!\" said Ron. \"How about it, Hagrid?\"', 'And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send -an owl to Charlie to ask him.', \"The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak. He had been down at Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.\", '\"It bit me!\" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. \"I\\'m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon\\'s the most horrible animal I\\'ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you\\'d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\"', 'There was a tap on the dark window.', '\"It\\'s Hedwig!\" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \"She\\'ll have Charlie\\'s answer!\"', 'The three of them put their heads together to read the note.', 'Dear Ron,', \"How are you? Thanks for the letter -- I'd be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon.\", \"Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark.\", 'Send me an answer as soon as possible.', 'Love,', 'Charlie', 'They looked at one another.', '\"We\\'ve got the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It shouldn\\'t be too difficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\"', 'It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy.', \"There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert's fangs were poisonous.\", 'Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.', '\"It\\'s not just my hand,\" he whispered, \"although that feels like it\\'s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I\\'ve told her it was a dog, but I don\\'t think she believes me -I shouldn\\'t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that\\'s why he\\'s doing this.\"', 'Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.', '\"It\\'ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\" said Hermione, but this didn\\'t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.', '\"Midnight on Saturday!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"Oh no oh no -- I\\'ve just remembered -- Charlie\\'s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he\\'s going to know we\\'re getting rid of Norbert.\"', \"Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\", '\"It\\'s too late to change the plan now,\" Harry told Hermione. \"We haven\\'t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We\\'ll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn\\'t know about that.\"', 'They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.', '\"I won\\'t let you in,\" he puffed. \"Norbert\\'s at a tricky stage -- nothin\\' I can\\'t handle.\"', \"When they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.\", '\"Aargh! It\\'s all right, he only got my boot -- jus\\' playin\\' -- he\\'s only a baby, after all.\"', \"The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough.\", \"They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.\", '\"He\\'s got lots o\\' rats an\\' some brandy fer the journey,\" said Hagrid in a muffled voice. \"An\\' I\\'ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\"', 'From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.', '\"Bye-bye, Norbert!\" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.', '\"Mommy will never forget you!\"', \"How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another staircase, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier.\", '\"Nearly there!\" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.', 'Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate.', 'Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.', 'Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.', '\"Detention!\" she shouted. \"And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you --\"', '\"You don\\'t understand, Professor. Harry Potter\\'s coming -- he\\'s got a dragon!\"', '\"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\"', \"The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\", '\"Malfoy\\'s got detention! I could sing!\"', '\"Don\\'t,\" Harry advised her.', 'Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.', \"Charlie's friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.\", 'They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.', 'At last, Norbert was going... going... gone.', \"They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy in detention -- what could spoil their happiness? The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.\", '\"Well, well, well,\" he whispered, \"we are in trouble.\"', \"They'd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.\", \"Things couldn't have been worse.\", \"Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn't see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.\", \"Had Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong.\", 'When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.', '\"Harry!\" Neville burst Out, the moment he saw the other two. \"I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag --\"', 'Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.', '\"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. It\\'s one o\\'clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.\"', \"It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.\", '\"I think I\\'ve got a good idea of what\\'s been going on,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"It doesn\\'t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I\\'ve already caught him. I suppose you think it\\'s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\"', \"Harry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville -- Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.\", '\"I\\'m disgusted,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Four students out of bed in one night! I\\'ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions -- yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it\\'s very dangerous -- and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.\"', '\"Fifty?\" Harry gasped -- they would lose the lead, the lead he\\'d won in the last Quidditch match.', '\"Fifty points each,\" said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.', '\"Professor -- please \"You can\\'t --\"', '\"Don\\'t tell me what I can and can\\'t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I\\'ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.\"', \"A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this? Harry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they'd done? At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there'd been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lo st them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.\", 'From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn\\'t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, \"Thanks Potter, we owe you one!\"', 'Only Ron stood by him.', '\"They\\'ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they\\'ve been here, and people still like them.\"', '\"They\\'ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?\" said Harry miserably.', '\"Well -- no,\" Ron admitted.', \"It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on. He'd had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.\", '\"Resign?\" Wood thundered. \"What good\\'ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can\\'t win at Quidditch?\"', 'But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn\\'t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him \"the Seeker.\"', \"Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn't have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.\", \"Harry was almost glad that the exams weren't far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions....\", \"Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell's voice.\", '\"No -- no -- not again, please --\"', 'It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.', '\"All right -- all right --\" he heard Quirrell sob.', \"Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him.\", \"He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end.\", \"Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling.\", \"All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step -- Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\", \"Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he'd heard.\", '\"Snape\\'s done it, then!\" said Ron. \"If Quirrell\\'s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell --\"', '\"There\\'s still Fluffy, though,\" said Hermione.', '\"Maybe Snape\\'s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\"', 'said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \"I bet there\\'s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\"', \"The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.\", '\"Go to Dumbledore. That\\'s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we\\'ll be thrown out for sure.\"', '\"But we\\'ve got no proof!\" said Harry. \"Quirrell\\'s too scared to back us up. Snape\\'s only got to say he doesn\\'t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you think they\\'ll believe, him or us? It\\'s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore\\'ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn\\'t help us if his life depended on it, he\\'s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he\\'ll think. And don\\'t forget, we\\'re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That\\'ll take a lot of explaining.\"', \"Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't.\", '\"If we just do a bit of poking around --\"', '\"No,\" said Harry flatly, \"we\\'ve done enough poking around.\"', 'He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons.', \"The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same: Your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight. Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.\", \"Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they'd lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they'd got.\", \"At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there -- and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.\", '\"Follow me,\" said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.', 'I bet you\\'ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won\\'t you, eh?\" he said, leering at them. \"Oh yes... hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me.... It\\'s just a pity they let the old punishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I\\'ve got the chains still in my office, keep \\'em well oiled in case they\\'re ever needed.... Right, off we go, and don\\'t think of running off, now, it\\'ll be worse for you if you do.\"', \"They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted.\", \"The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's hut. Then they heard a distant shout.\", '\"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\"', 'Harry\\'s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn\\'t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his -face, because Filch said, \"I suppose you think you\\'ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy -- it\\'s into the forest you\\'re going and I\\'m much mistaken if you\\'ll all come out in one piece.\"', 'At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.', '\"The forest?\" he repeated, and he didn\\'t sound quite as cool as usual.', '\"We can\\'t go in there at night -- there\\'s all sorts of things in there -- werewolves, I heard.\"', \"Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise.\", '\"That\\'s your problem, isn\\'t it?\" said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. \"Should\\'ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn\\'t you?\"', 'Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.', '\"Abou\\' time,\" he said. \"I bin waitin\\' fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?\"', '\"I shouldn\\'t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\" said Filch coldly, they\\'re here to be punished, after all.\"', '\"That\\'s why yer late, is it?\" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \"Bin lecturin\\' them, eh? \\'Snot your place ter do that. Yeh\\'ve done yer bit, I\\'ll take over from here.\"', '\"I\\'ll be back at dawn,\" said Filch, \"for what\\'s left of them,\" he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.', 'Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.', '\"I\\'m not going in that forest, he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.', '\"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\" said Hagrid fiercely.', '\"Yeh\\'ve done wrong an\\' now yehve got ter pay fer it.\"', '\"But this is servant stuff, it\\'s not for students to do. I thought we\\'d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he\\'d tell yer that\\'s how it is at Hogwarts,\" Hagrid growled. \"Copyin\\' lines! What good\\'s that ter anyone? Yeh\\'ll do summat useful or Yeh\\'ll get out.', 'If yeh think yer father\\'d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an\\' pack. Go on\"\\' Malfoy didn\\'t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze.', '\"Right then,\" said Hagrid, \"now, listen carefully, \\'cause it\\'s dangerous what we\\'re gonna do tonight, an\\' I don\\' want no one takin\\' risks. Follow me over here a moment.\"', 'He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.', '\"Look there,\" said Hagrid, \"see that stuff shinin\\' on the ground? Silvery stuff? That\\'s unicorn blood. There\\'s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We\\'re gonna try an\\' find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.\"', '\"And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\" said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.', '\"There\\'s nothin\\' that lives in the forest that\\'ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\' keep ter the path. Right, now, we\\'re gonna split inter two parties an\\' follow the trail in diff\\'rent directions. There\\'s blood all over the place, it must\\'ve bin staggerin\\' around since last night at least.\"', '\"I want Fang,\" said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang\\'s long teeth.', '\"All right, but I warn yeh, he\\'s a coward,\" said Hagrid. \" So me, Harry, an\\' Hermione\\'ll go one way an\\' Draco, Neville, an\\' Fang\\'ll go the other.', 'Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we\\'ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an\\' practice now -- that\\'s it -- an\\' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an\\' we\\'ll all come an\\' find yeh -- so, be careful -- let\\'s go.\"', 'The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.', 'They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.', 'Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.', '\"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\" Harry asked.', '\"Not fast enough,\" said Hagrid. \"It\\'s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they\\'re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.\"', 'They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.', '\"You all right, Hermione?\" Hagrid whispered. \"Don\\' worry, it can\\'t\\'ve gone far if it\\'s this badly hurt, an\\' then we\\'ll be able ter -- GET BEHIND THAT TREE!\"', 'Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.', '\"I knew it, \" he murmured. \"There\\'s summat in here that shouldn\\' be.\"', '\"A werewolf?\" Harry suggested.', '\"That wasn\\' no werewolf an\\' it wasn\\' no unicorn, neither,\" said Hagrid grimly. \"Right, follow me, but careful, now.\"', 'They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound.', 'Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.', '\"Who\\'s there?\" Hagrid called. \"Show yerself -- I\\'m armed!\"', \"And into the clearing came -- was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione's jaws dropped.\", '\"Oh, it\\'s you, Ronan,\" said Hagrid in relief. \"How are yeh?\"', \"He walked forward and shook the centaur's hand.\", '\"Good evening to you, Hagrid,\" said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. \"Were you going to shoot me?\"', '\"Can\\'t be too careful, Ronan,\" said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.', '\"There\\'s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an\\' Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An\\' this is Ronan, you two. He\\'s a centaur.)) \"We\\'d noticed,\" said Hermione faintly.', '\"Good evening,\" said Ronan. \"Students, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?\"', '\"Erm --\"', '\"A bit,\" said Hermione timidly.', '\"A bit. Well, that\\'s something.\" Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. \"Mars is bright tonight.\"', '\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \"Listen, I\\'m glad we\\'ve run inter yeh, Ronan, \\'cause there\\'s a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin\\'?\"', \"Ronan didn't answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again.\", '\"Always the innocent are the first victims,\" he said. \"So it has been for ages past, so it is now.\"', '\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"but have yeh seen anythin\\', Ronan? Anythin\\' unusual?\"', '\"Mars is bright tonight,\" Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. \"Unusually bright.\"', '\"Yeah, but I was meanin\\' anythin\\' unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid. \"So yeh haven\\'t noticed anythin\\' strange?\"', 'Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, \"The forest hides many secrets.\"', 'A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.', '\"Hullo, Bane,\" said Hagrid. \"All right?\"', '\"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\"', '\"Well enough. Look, I\\'ve jus\\' bin askin\\' Ronan, you seen anythin\\' odd in here lately? There\\'s a unicorn bin injured -- would yeh know anythin\\' about it?\"', 'Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. \"Mars is bright tonight,\" he said simply.', '\"We\\'ve heard,\" said Hagrid grumpily. \"Well, if either of you do see anythin\\', let me know, won\\'t yeh? We\\'ll be off, then.\"', 'Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.', '\"Never,\" said Hagrid irritably, \"try an\\' get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin\\' closer\\'n the moon.\"', '\"Are there many of them in here?\" asked Hermione.', '\"Oh, a fair few... Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they\\'re good enough about turnin\\' up if ever I want a word. They\\'re deep, mind, centaurs... they know things... jus\\' don\\' let on much.\"', '\"D\\'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\" said Harry.', '\"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what\\'s bin killin\\' the unicorns -- never heard anythin\\' like it before.\"', 'They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them.', \"They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's arm.\", '\"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\"', '\"You two wait here!\" Hagrid shouted. \"Stay on the path, I\\'ll come back for yeh!\"', \"They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.\", '\"You don\\'t think they\\'ve been hurt, do you?\" whispered Hermione.', '\"I don\\'t care if Malfoy has, but if something\\'s got Neville... it\\'s our fault he\\'s here in the first place.\"', \"The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.\", \"What was going on? Where were the others? At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.\", '\"We\\'ll be lucky ter catch anythin\\' now, with the racket you two were makin\\'. Right, we\\'re changin\\' groups -- Neville, you stay with me an\\' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an\\' this idiot. I\\'m sorry,\" Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, \"but he\\'ll have a harder time frightenin\\' you, an\\' we\\'ve gotta get this done.\"', 'So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.', '\"Look --\" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.', 'Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.', 'It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.', 'Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered....', \"Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.\", '\"AAAAAAAAAARGH!\"', \"Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry -- he couldn't move for fear.\", \"Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.\", \"The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body.\", '\"Are you all right?\" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.', '\"Yes -- thank you -- what was that?\"', \"The centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead.\", '\"You are the Potter boy,\" he said. \"You had better get back to Hagrid.', 'The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.', '\"My name is Firenze,\" he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.', 'There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.', '\"Firenze!\" Bane thundered. \"What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\"', '\"Do you realize who this is?\" said Firenze. \"This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\"', '\"What have you been telling him?\" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?\"', 'Ronan pawed the ground nervously. \"I\\'m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, \" he said in his gloomy voice.', 'Bane kicked his back legs in anger.', '\"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\"', 'Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.', '\"Do you not see that unicorn?\" Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\"', 'And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.', \"Harry didn't have a clue what was going on.\", '\"Why\\'s Bane so angry?\" he asked. \"What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?\"', \"Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\", '\"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?\"', '\"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question. \"We\\'ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\"', '\"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said Firenze. \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\"', \"Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.\", '\"But who\\'d be that desperate?\" he wondered aloud. \"If you\\'re going to be cursed forever, deaths better, isn\\'t it?\"', '\"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die.', 'Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\"', '\"The Sorcerer\\'s Stone! Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I don\\'t understand who --\"', '\"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\"', 'It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry\\'s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \"Some say he died.', 'Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\"', '\"Do you mean,\" Harry croaked, \"that was Vol-\"', '\"Harry! Harry, are you all right?\"', 'Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.', '\"I\\'m fine,\" said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \"The unicorn\\'s dead, Hagrid, it\\'s in that clearing back there.\"', '\"This is where I leave you,\" Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \"You are safe now.\"', 'Harry slid off his back.', '\"Good luck, Harry Potter,\" said Firenze. \"The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\"', 'He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.', 'Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.', \"Harry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.\", '\"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort\\'s waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich....\"', '\"Stop saying the name!\" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.', \"Harry wasn't listening.\", '\"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn\\'t have done so.... Bane was furious...', 'he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen.... They must show that Voldemort\\'s coming back.... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.... I suppose that\\'s written in the stars as well.\"', '\"Will you stop saying the name!\" Ron hissed.', '\"So all I\\'ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\" Harry went on feverishly, \"then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off... Well, I suppose Bane\\'ll be happy.\"', 'Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.', '\"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore\\'s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won\\'t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that\\'s a very imprecise branch of magic.\"', \"The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night's surprises weren't over.\", 'When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it: Just in case.', 'In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.', 'It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.', 'They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox -- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.', \"Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.\", \"Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.\", \"Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest.\", '\"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn\\'t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\"', 'Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \"No more studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we\\'ve got a week before we find out how badly we\\'ve done, there\\'s no need to worry yet.\"', 'Harry was rubbing his forehead.', '\"I wish I knew what this means!\" he burst out angrily. \"My scar keeps hurting -- it\\'s happened before, but never as often as this.\"', '\"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested.', '\"I\\'m not ill,\" said Harry. \"I think it\\'s a warning... it means danger\\'s coming....\"', \"Ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot.\", '\"Harry, relax, Hermione\\'s right, the Stone\\'s safe as long as Dumbledore\\'s around. Anyway, we\\'ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he\\'s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\"', 'Harry nodded, but he couldn\\'t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he\\'d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \"That\\'s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we\\'d done that one.\"', \"Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore.\", 'Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but -- Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.', '\"Where\\'re you going?\" said Ron sleepily.', '\"I\\'ve just thought of something,\" said Harry. He had turned white.', '\"We\\'ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\"', '\"Why?\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.', '\"Don\\'t you think it\\'s a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket?

Got time fer a drink?\"', '\"Yes, please,\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off.', '\"No, we\\'re in a hurry. Hagrid, I\\'ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert?

Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\"', '\"Mighta come up,\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.', '\"Yeah... he asked what I did, an\\' I told him I was gamekeeper here....', \"He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told him... an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon... an' then...

So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy...\"', '\"And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy?\" Harry asked, try ing to keep his voice calm.', '\"Well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d\\'yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy\\'s a piece o\\' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus\\' play him a bit o\\' music an\\' he\\'ll go straight off ter sleep --\"', 'Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.', '\"I shouldn\\'ta told yeh that!\" he blurted out. \"Forget I said it! Hey -- where\\'re yeh goin\\'?\"', \"Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.\", '\"We\\'ve got to go to Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak -- it must\\'ve been easy, once he\\'d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn\\'t stop him. Where\\'s Dumbledore\\'s office?\"', 'They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.', '\"We\\'ll just have to --\" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.', '\"What are you three doing inside?\"', 'It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.', '\"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.', '\"See Professor Dumbledore?\" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \"Why?\"', 'Harry swallowed -- now what? \"It\\'s sort of secret,\" he said, but he wished at once he hadn\\'t, because Professor McGonagall\\'s nostrils flared.', '\"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\" she said coldly. \"He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\"', '\"He\\'s gone?\" said Harry frantically. \"Now?\"', '\"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time -- \"But this is important.\"', '\"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter.', '\"Look,\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \"Professor -- it\\'s about the Sorcerer\\'s tone --\"', \"Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up.\", '\"How do you know --?\" she spluttered.', '\"Professor, I think -- I know -- that Sn- that someone\\'s going to try and steal the Stone. I\\'ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\"', 'She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.', '\"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\" she said finally. I don\\'t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it\\'s too well protected.\"', '\"But Professor --\"', '\"Potter, I know what I\\'m talking about,\" she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.\"', \"But they didn't.\", '\"It\\'s tonight,\" said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. \"Snape\\'s going through the trapdoor tonight. He\\'s found out everything he needs, and now he\\'s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.\"', '\"But what can we --\"', 'Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.', 'Snape was standing there.', '\"Good afternoon,\" he said smoothly.', 'They stared at him.', '\"You shouldn\\'t be inside on a day like this,\" he said, with an odd, twisted smile.', '\"We were --\" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.', '\"You want to be more careful,\" said Snape. \"Hanging around like this, people will think you\\'re up to something. And Gryffindor really can\\'t afford to lose any more points, can it?\"', 'Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.', '\"Be warned, Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\"', 'He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.', 'Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.', '\"Right, here\\'s what we\\'ve got to do,\" he whispered urgently. \"One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you\\'d better do that.\"', '\"Why me?\"', '\"It\\'s obvious,\" said Ron. \"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\" He put on a high voice, \"\\'Oh Professor Flitwick, I\\'m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....\\'\\x93', '\"Oh, shut up,\" said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.', '\"And we\\'d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\" Harry told Ron.', '\"Come on.\"', \"But that part of the plan didn't work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\", '\"I suppose you think you\\'re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\" she stormed. \"Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you \\'ve come anywhere near here again, I\\'ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\" Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, \"At least Hermione\\'s on Snape\\'s tail,\" when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.', '\"I\\'m sorry, Harry!\" she wailed. \"Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I\\'ve only just got away, I don\\'t know where Snape went.\"', '\"Well, that\\'s it then, isn\\'t it?\" Harry said.', 'The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.', '\"I\\'m going out of here tonight and I\\'m going to try and get to the Stone first.\"', '\"You\\'re mad!\" said Ron.', '\"You can\\'t!\" said Hermione. \"After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You\\'ll be expelled!\"', '\"SO WHAP\" Harry shouted. \"Don\\'t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort\\'s coming back! Haven\\'t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won\\'t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He\\'ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn\\'t matter anymore, can\\'t you see? D\\'you think he\\'ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I\\'ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it\\'s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I\\'m never going over to the Dark Side! I\\'m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\"', 'He glared at them.', '\"You\\'re right Harry,\" said Hermione in a small voice.', '\"I\\'ll use the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It\\'s just lucky I got it back.\"', '\"But will it cover all three of us?\" said Ron.', '\"All -- all three of us?\"', '\"Oh, come off it, you don\\'t think we\\'d let you go alone?\"', '\"Of course not,\" said Hermione briskly. \"How do you think you\\'d get to the Stone without us? I\\'d better go and took through my books, there might be something useful...\"', '\"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\"', '\"Not if I can help it,\" said Hermione grimly. \"Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They\\'re not throwing me out after that.\"', 'After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.', \"Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.\", 'Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.', '\"Better get the cloak,\" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn\\'t feel much like singing.', 'He ran back down to the common room.', '\"We\\'d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --\"', '\"What are you doing?\" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he\\'d been making another bid for freedom.', '\"Nothing, Neville, nothing,\" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.', 'Neville stared at their guilty faces.', '\"You\\'re going out again,\" he said.', '\"No, no, no,\" said Hermione. \"No, we\\'re not. Why don\\'t you go to bed, Neville?\"', \"Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn't afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.\", '\"You can\\'t go out,\" said Neville, \"you\\'ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.\"', '\"You don\\'t understand,\" said Harry, \"this is important.\"', 'But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.', 'I won\\'t let you do it,\" he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. \"I\\'ll -- I\\'ll fight you!\"', '\"Neville, \"Ron exploded, \"get away from that hole and don\\'t be an idiot --\"', '\"Don\\'t you call me an idiot!\" said Neville. I don\\'t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\"', '\"Yes, but not to us,\" said Ron in exasperation. \"Neville, you don\\'t know what you\\'re doing.\"', 'He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.', '\"Go on then, try and hit me!\" said Neville, raising his fists. \"I\\'m ready!\"', 'Harry turned to Hermione.', '\"Do something,\" he said desperately.', 'Hermione stepped forward.', '\"Neville,\" she said, \"I\\'m really, really sorry about this.\"', 'She raised her wand.', '\"Petrificus Totalus!\" she cried, pointing it at Neville.', \"Neville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.\", \"Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.\", '\"What\\'ve you done to him?\" Harry whispered.', '\"It\\'s the full Body-Bind,\" said Hermione miserably. \"Oh, Neville, I\\'m so sorry.\"', '\"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\" said Harry.', '\"You\\'ll understand later, Neville,\" said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak.', \"But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.\", '\"Oh, let\\'s kick her, just this once,\" Ron whispered in Harry\\'s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn\\'t do anything.', \"They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.\", '\"Who\\'s there?\" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \"Know you\\'re there, even if I can\\'t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\"', 'He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.', '\"Should call Filch, I should, if something\\'s a-creeping around unseen.\"', 'Harry had a sudden idea.', '\"Peeves,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.\"', 'Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.', '\"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,\" he said greasily. \"My mistake, my mistake -- I didn\\'t see you -- of course I didn\\'t, you\\'re invisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\"', '\"I have business here, Peeves,\" croaked Harry. \"Stay away from this place tonight.\"', '\"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\" said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I\\'ll not bother you.\"', 'And he scooted off \"Brilliant, Harry!\" whispered Ron.', 'A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor -- and the door was already ajar.', '\"Well, there you are,\" Harry said quietly, \"Snape\\'s already got past Fluffy.\"', 'Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.', '\"If you want to go back, I won\\'t blame you,\" he said. \"You can take the cloak, I won\\'t need it now.\"', '\"Don\\'t be stupid,\" said Ron.', '\"We\\'re coming,\" said Hermione.', 'Harry pushed the door open.', \"As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them.\", '\"What\\'s that at its feet?\" Hermione whispered.', '\"Looks like a harp,\" said Ron. \"Snape must have left it there.\"', '\"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry. \"Well, here goes...\"', \"He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\", '\"Keep playing,\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog\\'s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. \"I think we\\'ll be able to pull the door open,\" said Ron, peering over the dog\\'s back. \"Want to go first, Hermione?\"', '\"No, I don\\'t!\"', '\"All right.\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog\\'s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.', '\"What can you see?\" Hermione said anxiously.', '\"Nothing -- just black -- there\\'s no way of climbing down, we\\'ll just have to drop.\"', 'Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.', '\"You want to go first? Are you sure?\" said Ron. \"I don\\'t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\"', \"Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.\", 'Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.', 'He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \"If anything happens to me, don\\'t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\"', '\"Right,\" said Ron.', '\"See you in a minute, I hope...', 'And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and -- FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.', '\"It\\'s okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \"it\\'s a soft landing, you can jump!\"', 'Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.', '\"What\\'s this stuff?\" were his first words.', '\"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it\\'s here to break the fall.', 'Come on, Hermione!\"', \"The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side.\", '\"We must be miles under the school , she said.', '\"Lucky this plant thing\\'s here, really,\" said Ron.', '\"Lucky!\" shrieked Hermione. \"Look at you both!\"', 'She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.', 'Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.', '\"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is -- it\\'s Devil\\'s Snare!\"', '\"Oh, I\\'m so glad we know what it\\'s called, that\\'s a great help,\" snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \"Shut up, I\\'m trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione.', '\"Well, hurry up, I can\\'t breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.', '\"Devil\\'s Snare, Devil\\'s Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it likes the dark and the damp \"So light a fire!\" Harry choked.', '\"Yes -- of course -- but there\\'s no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her hands.', '\"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\"', '\"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.', 'Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.', '\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.', '\"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn\\'t lose his head in a crisis -- \\'there\\'s no wood,\\' honestly.\"', '\"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.', \"All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad enough...\", '\"Can you hear something?\" Ron whispered.', 'Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.', '\"Do you think it\\'s a ghost?\"', '\"I don\\'t know... sounds like wings to me.\"', '\"There\\'s light ahead -- I can see something moving.\"', 'They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.', '\"Do you think they\\'ll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron.', '\"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don\\'t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there\\'s no other choice... I\\'ll run.\"', 'He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.', \"The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\", '\"Now what?\" said Ron.', '\"These birds... they can\\'t be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione.', 'They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering? \"They\\'re not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They\\'re keys! Winged keys -- look carefully. So that must mean...\" he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"... yes -- look! Broomsticks! We\\'ve got to catch the key to the door!\"', '\"But there are hundreds of them!\"', 'Ron examined the lock on the door.', '\"We\\'re looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the handle.\"', 'They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.', \"Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.\", '\"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one -- there -- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\"', 'Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.', '\"We\\'ve got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I\\'ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\"', \"Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber.\", 'They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.', '\"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.', \"The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.\", 'They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces.', '\"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered.', '\"It\\'s obvious, isn\\'t it?\" said Ron. \"We\\'ve got to play our way across the room.\"', 'Behind the white pieces they could see another door.', '\"How?\" said Hermione nervously.', '\"I think,\" said Ron, \"we\\'re going to have to be chessmen.\"', \"He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\", '\"Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?\" The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.', '\"This needs thinking about he said. I suppose we\\'ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces....\"', 'Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \"Now, don\\'t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess --\"', '\"We\\'re not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\"', '\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90 next to him instead of that castle.\"', '\"What about you?\"', '\"I\\'m going to be a knight,\" said Ron.', 'The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.', '\"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board.', '\"Yes... look...\"', 'A white pawn had moved forward two squares.', 'Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry\\'s knees were trembling. What if they lost? \"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right.\"', 'Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.', '\"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken. \"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\"', 'Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.', 'Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall.', 'Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.', '\"We\\'re nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly. \"Let me think let me think...\"', 'The white queen turned her blank face toward him.', '\"Yes...\" said Ron softly, \"It\\'s the only way... I\\'ve got to be taken.\"', '\"NOF Harry and Hermione shouted.', '\"That\\'s chess!\" snapped Ron. \"You\\'ve got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she\\'ll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\"', '\"But --\"', '\"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\"', '\"Ron --\"', '\"Look, if you don\\'t hurry up, he\\'ll already have the Stone!\"', 'There was no alternative.', '\"Ready?\" Ron called, his face pale but determined. \"Here I go - now, don\\'t hang around once you\\'ve won.\"', \"He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor - Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out.\", 'Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.', \"The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.\", '\"What if he\\'s --?\"', '\"He\\'ll be all right,\" said Harry, trying to convince himself. \"What do you reckon\\'s next?\"', '\"We\\'ve had Sprout\\'s, that was the Devil\\'s Snare; Flitwick must\\'ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell\\'s spell, and Snape\\'s.\"', 'They had reached another door.', '\"All right?\" Harry whispered.', '\"Go on.\"', 'Harry pushed it open.', 'A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.', '\"I\\'m glad we didn\\'t have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \"Come on, I can\\'t breathe.\"', 'He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.', '\"Snape\\'s,\" said Harry. \"What do we have to do?\"', \"They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward.\", 'They were trapped.', '\"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, which ever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.', \"Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine's left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\", 'Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.', '\"Brilliant,\" said Hermione. \"This isn\\'t magic -- it\\'s logic -- a puzzle.', 'A lot of the greatest wizards haven\\'t got an ounce of logic, they\\'d be stuck in here forever.\"', '\"But so will we, won\\'t we?\" \"Of course not,\" said Hermione. \"Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\"', '\"But how do we know which to drink?\"', '\"Give me a minute.\"', 'Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.', '\"Got it,\" she said. \"The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire -- toward the Stone.\"', 'Harry looked at the tiny bottle.', '\"There\\'s only enough there for one of us,\" he said. \"That\\'s hardly one swallow.\"', 'They looked at each other.', '\"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\"', 'Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.', '\"You drink that,\" said Harry. \"No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying- key room, they\\'ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I\\'m no match for him, really.\"', '\"But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who\\'s with him?\"', '\"Well -- I was lucky once, wasn\\'t I?\" said Harry, pointing at his scar.', '\"I might get lucky again.\"', \"Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.\", '\"Hermione!\"', '\"Harry -- you\\'re a great wizard, you know.\"', '\"I\\'m not as good as you,\" said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.', '\"Me!\" said Hermione. \"Books! And cleverness! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!\"', '\"You drink first,\" said Harry. \"You are sure which is which, aren\\'t you?\"', '\"Positive,\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.', '\"It\\'s not poison?\" said Harry anxiously.', '\"No -- but it\\'s like ice.\"', '\"Quick, go, before it wears off.\"', '\"Good luck -- take care.\"', '\"GO!\"', 'Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.', 'Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames.', '\"Here I come,\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.', \"It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel them -- for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire -- then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.\", \"There was already someone there -- but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even Voldemort.\", '\"You!\" gasped Harry.', \"Quirrell smiled. His face wasn't twitching at all.\", '\"Me,\" he said calmly. \"I wondered whether I\\'d be meeting you here, Potter.\"', '\"But I thought -- Snape --\"', '\"Severus?\" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn\\'t his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. \"Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn\\'t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\"', \"Harry couldn't take it in. This couldn't be true, it couldn't.\", '\"But Snape tried to kill me!\"', '\"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I\\'d have got you off that broom. I\\'d have managed it before then if Snape hadn\\'t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.\"', '\"Snape was trying to save me?\"', '\"Of course,\" said Quirrell coolly. \"\\\\Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn\\'t do it again. Funny, really... he needn\\'t have bothered. I couldn\\'t do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular...', 'and what a waste of time, when after all that, I\\'m going to kill you tonight.\"', 'Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.', '\"You\\'re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you\\'d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.\"', '\"You let the troll in?\"', '\"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn\\'t even manage to bite Snape\\'s leg off properly.', '\"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.', 'It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.', 'It was the Mirror of Erised.', '\"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\" Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. \"Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this... but he\\'s in London... I\\'ll be far away by the time he gets back....\"', 'All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.', '\"I saw you and Snape in the forest --\" he blurted out.', '\"Yes,\" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. \"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I\\'d got.', 'He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me - as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side....\"', 'Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.', '\"I see the Stone... I\\'m presenting it to my master... but where is it?\"', \"Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\", '\"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\"', '\"Oh, he does,\" said Quirrell casually, \"heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn\\'t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.\"', '\"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was threatening you....\"', \"For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face.\", '\"Sometimes,\" he said, \"I find it hard to follow my master\\'s instructions -- he is a great wizard and I am weak --\"', '\"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\" Harry gasped.', '\"He is with me wherever I go,\" said Quirrell quietly. \"I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\"', 'Quirrell shivered suddenly. \"He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me....\"', \"Quirrell's voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley -how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\", 'Quirrell cursed under his breath.', '\"I don\\'t understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?\"', \"Harry's mind was racing.\", 'What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myseff finding it -- which means I\\'ll see where it\\'s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I\\'m up to? He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself. \"What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\"', 'And to Harry\\'s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself \"Use the boy... Use the boy...\"', 'Quirrell rounded on Harry.', '\"Yes -- Potter -- come here.\"', 'He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.', '\"Come here,\" Quirrell repeated. \"Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.\"', 'Harry walked toward him.', \"I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that's all.\", \"Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.\", \"He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket -- and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow -- incredibly -- he'd gotten the Stone.\", '\"Well?\" said Quirrell impatiently. \"What do you see?\"', 'Harry screwed up his courage.', '\"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\" he invented. \"I -- I\\'ve won the house cup for Gryffindor.\"', 'Quirrell cursed again.', '\"Get out of the way,\" he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer\\'s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it? But he hadn\\'t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn\\'t moving his lips.', '\"He lies... He lies...\"', '\"Potter, come back here!\" Quirrell shouted. \"Tell me the truth! What did you just see?\"', 'The high voice spoke again.', '\"Let me speak to him... face-to-face...\"', '\"Master, you are not strong enough!\"', '\"I have strength enough... for this....\"', \"Harry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn't move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell's head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.\", \"Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.\", '\"Harry Potter...\" it whispered.', \"Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move.\", '\"See what I have become?\" the face said. \"Mere shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can share another\\'s body... but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own.... Now... why don\\'t you give me that Stone in your pocket?\"', \"So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry's legs. He stumbled backward.\", '\"Don\\'t be a fool,\" snarled the face. \"Better save your own life and join me... or you\\'ll meet the same end as your parents.... They died begging me for mercy...\"', '\"LIAR!\" Harry shouted suddenly.', 'Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling.', '\"How touching...\" it hissed. \"I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your parents were brave.... I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight... but your mother needn\\'t have died... she was trying to protect you.... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.\"', '\"NEVER!\"', 'Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \"SEIZE HIM!\"', \"and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers -- they were blistering before his eyes.\", '\"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!\" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet\\' landing on top of him, both hands around Harry\\'s neck -- Harry\\'s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.', '\"Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!\"', 'And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.', '\"Then kill him, fool, and be done!\" screeched Voldemort.', 'Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell\\'s face -- \"AAAARGH!\"', \"Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.\", 'Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off -- the pain in Harry\\'s head was building -- he couldn\\'t see -- he could only hear Quirrell\\'s terrible shrieks and Voldemort\\'s yells of, \"KILL HIM! KILL HIM!\" and other voices, maybe in Harry\\'s own head, crying, \"Harry! Harry!\"', \"He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down... down...\", 'Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.', \"He blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.\", 'He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.', '\"Good afternoon, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \"Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He\\'s got the Stone! Sir, quick --\"', '\"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\" said Dumbledore. \"Quirrell does not have the Stone.\"', '\"Then who does? Sir, I --\"', '\"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.', 'Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.', '\"Tokens from your friends and admirers,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\"', '\"How long have I been in here?\"', '\"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\"', '\"But sit, the Stone I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.', '\"You got there? You got Hermione\\'s owl?\"', '\"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\"', '\"It was you.\"', '\"I feared I might be too late.\"', '\"You nearly were, I couldn\\'t have kept him off the Stone much longer --\"', '\"Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.\"', '\"Destroyed?\" said Harry blankly. \"But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel --\"', '\"Oh, you know about Nicolas?\" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted.', '\"You did do the thing properly, didn\\'t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it\\'s all for the best.\"', '\"But that means he and his wife will die, won\\'t they?\"', '\"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.\"', \"Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face.\", '\"To one as young as you, I\\'m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\" Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.', '\"Sir?\" said Harry. \"I\\'ve been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone\\'s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --\"', '\"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\"', '\"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort\\'s going to try other ways of coming back, isn\\'t he? I mean, he hasn\\'t gone, has he?\"', '\"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.', 'He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.\"', 'Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, \"Sir, there are some other things I\\'d like to know, if you can tell me... things I want to know the truth about....\"', '\"The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you\\'ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\"', '\"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?\"', 'Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.', '\"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry.', 'When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are ready, you will know.\"', 'And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.', '\"But why couldn\\'t Quirrell touch me?\"', '\"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\\'t realize that love as powerful as your mother\\'s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\"', 'Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, \"And the invisibility cloak - do you know who sent it to me?\"', '\"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\" Dumbledore\\'s eyes twinkled. \"Useful things... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\"', '\"And there\\'s something else...\"', '\"Fire away.\"', '\"Quirrell said Snape --\"', '\"Professor Snape, Harry.\" \"Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?\"', '\"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\"', '\"What?\"', '\"He saved his life.\"', '\"What?\"', '\"Yes...\" said Dumbledore dreamily. \"Funny, the way people\\'s minds work, isn\\'t it? Professor Snape couldn\\'t bear being in your father\\'s debt....', 'I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father\\'s memory in peace....\"', 'Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.', '\"And sir, there\\'s one more thing...\"', '\"Just the one?\"', '\"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\"', '\"Ah, now, I\\'m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that\\'s saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be able to get it, otherwise they\\'d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes.... Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since then I\\'m afraid I\\'ve rather lost my liking for them -- but I think I\\'ll be safe with a nice toffee, don\\'t you?\"', 'He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, \"Alas! Ear wax!\"', 'Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.', '\"Just five minutes,\" Harry pleaded.', '\"Absolutely not.\"', '\"You let Professor Dumbledore in...\"', '\"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.\"', '\"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey...\"', '\"Oh, very well,\" she said. \"But five minutes only.\"', 'And she let Ron and Hermione in.', '\"Harry!\"', 'Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.', '\"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried --\"', '\"The whole school\\'s talking about it,\" said Ron. \"What really happened?\"', \"It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\", '\"So the Stone\\'s gone?\" said Ron finally. \"Flamel\\'s just going to die?\"', '\"That\\'s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- \\'to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.', '\"I always said he was off his rocker,\" said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.', '\"So what happened to you two?\" said Harry.', '\"Well, I got back all right,\" said Hermione. \"I brought Ron round -- that took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he just said, \\'Harry\\'s gone after him, hasn\\'t he?\\' and hurtled off to the third floor.\"', '\"D\\'you think he meant you to do it?\" said Ron. \"Sending you your father\\'s cloak and everything?\"', '\"Well, \" Hermione exploded, \"if he did -- I mean to say that\\'s terrible -- you could have been killed.\"', '\"No, it isn\\'t,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He\\'s a funny man, Dumbledore.', 'I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don\\'t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It\\'s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could....\"', '\"Yeah, Dumbledore\\'s off his rocker, all right,\" said Ron proudly.', '\"Listen, you\\'ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course -- you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but the food\\'ll be good.\"', 'At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.', '\"You\\'ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT\" she said firmly.', \"After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\", 'I want to go to the feast,\" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. I can, can\\'t I?\"', '\"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\" she said stiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\\'t realize how risky feasts could be. \"And you have another visitor.\"', '\"Oh, good,\" said Harry. \"Who is it?\"', 'Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.', '\"It\\'s -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!\" he sobbed, his face in his hands.', 'I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn\\'t know, an\\' I told him! Yeh could\\'ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I\\'ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an\\' made ter live as a Muggle!\"', '\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \"Hagrid, he\\'d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we\\'re talking about, he\\'d have found out even if you hadn\\'t told him.\"', '\"Yeh could\\'ve died!\" sobbed Hagrid. \"An\\' don\\' say the name!\"', '\"VOLDEMORT!\" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. \"I\\'ve met him and I\\'m calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it\\'s gone, he can\\'t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I\\'ve got loads....\"', 'Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \"That reminds me. I\\'ve got yeh a present.\"', '\"It\\'s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\" said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. \"Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. \\'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway, got yeh this...\"', 'It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.', '\"Sent owls off ter all yer parents\\' old school friends, askin\\' fer photos... knew yeh didn\\' have any... d\\'yeh like it?\"', \"Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.\", \"Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\", 'When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.', 'Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.', '\"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble you with an old man\\'s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts....', '\"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.\"', 'A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.', 'Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.', '\"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent events must be taken into account.\"', \"The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.\", '\"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last-minute points to dish out.', 'Let me see. Yes...', '\"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley...\"', 'Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.', '\"...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"', 'Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall\\'s giant chess set!\"', 'At last there was silence again.', '\"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"', 'Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves -- they were a hundred points up. \"Third -- to Mr. Harry Potter...\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\"', 'The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points -- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.', 'Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.', '\"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\"', 'Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.', \"Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.\", '\"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we need a little change of decoration.\"', \"He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\", \"It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would never, ever forget tonight.\", \"Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.\", 'And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville\\'s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\"I always hope they\\'ll forget to give us these,\" said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King\\'s Cross Station.', \"It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\", '\"You must come and stay this summer,\" said Ron, \"both of you -- I\\'ll send you an owl.\"', '\"Thanks,\" said Harry, \"I\\'ll need something to look forward to.\" People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called: \"Bye, Harry!\"', '\"See you, Potter!\"', '\"Still famous,\" said Ron, grinning at him.', '\"Not where I\\'m going, I promise you,\" said Harry.', 'He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \"There he is, Mom, there he is, look!\"', \"It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at Ron.\", '\"Harry Potter!\" she squealed. \"Look, Mom! I can see \"Be quiet, Ginny, and it\\'s rude to point.\"', 'Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.', '\"Busy year?\" she said.', '\"Very,\" said Harry. \"Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.\"', '\"Oh, it was nothing, dear.\"', '\"Ready, are you?\"', 'It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.', '\"You must be Harry\\'s family!\" said Mrs. Weasley.', '\"In a manner of speaking,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"Hurry up, boy, we haven\\'t got all day.\" He walked away.', 'Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.', '\"See you over the summer, then.\"', '\"Hope you have -- er -- a good holiday,\" said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.', '\"Oh, I will,\" said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. \"They don\\'t know we\\'re not allowed to use magic at home. I\\'m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer....\"', 'THE END \\r\\naahhaahh hey hey hey']\n",

Rowling\\r\\n(this is BOOK 2 in the Harry Potter series)\\r\\nOriginal Scanned/OCR: Friday, April 07, 2000\\r\\nv1.0\\r\\n(edit where needed, change version number by 0.1)\\r\\nC H A P T E O N E\\r\\nTHE WORST BIRTHDAY\\r\\nNot for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at\\r\\nnumber four, Privet Drive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in\\r\\nthe early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his\\r\\nnephew Harry\\'s room.\\r\\n\"Third time this week!\" he roared across the table. \"If you can\\'t\\r\\ncontrol that owl, it\\'ll have to go!\"\\r\\nHarry tried, yet again, to explain.\\r\\n\"She\\'s bored,\" he said. \"She\\'s used to flying around outside. If I could\\r\\njust let her out at night -\"\\r\\n\"Do I look stupid?\" snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling\\r\\nfrom his bushy mustache. \"I know what\\'ll happen if that owl\\'s let\\r\\nout.\"\\r\\nHe exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.\\r\\nHarry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long,\\r\\nloud belch from the Dursleys\\' son, Dudley.\\r\\n2\\r\\n\"I want more bacon.\"\\r\\n\"There\\'s more in the frying pan, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia,\\r\\nturning misty eyes on her massive son. \"We must build you up while\\r\\nwe\\'ve got the chance .... I don\\'t like the sound of that school food\\r\\n......\\r\\n\"Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,\"\\r\\nsaid Uncle Vernon heartily. \"Dudley gets enough, don\\'t you, son?\"\\r\\nDudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the\\r\\nkitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.\\r\\n\"Pass the frying pan.\"\\r\\n\"You\\'ve forgotten the magic word,\" said Harry irritably.\\r\\nThe effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was\\r\\nincredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that\\r\\nshook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and\\r\\nclapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet,\\r\\nveins throbbing in his temples.\\r\\n\"I meant `please\\'!\" said Harry quickly. \"I didn\\'t mean -\"\\r\\n\"WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,\" thundered his uncle, spraying spit\\r\\nover the table, \"ABOUT SAYING THE `M\\' WORD IN OUR\\r\\nHOUSE?\"\\r\\n\"But I -\"\\r\\n\"HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!\" roared Uncle\\r\\nVernon, pounding the table with his fist.\\r\\n\"I just -\"\\r\\n\"I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF\\r\\nYOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!\"\\r\\nHarry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was\\r\\ntrying to heave Dudley to his feet.\\r\\n3\\r\\n\"All right,\" said Harry, \"all right. . . \"\\r\\nUncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and\\r\\nwatching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.\\r\\nEver since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle\\r\\nVernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any\\r\\nmoment, because Harry Potter wasn\\'t a normal boy. As a matter of\\r\\nfact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.\\r\\nHarry Potter was a wizard - a wizard fresh from his first year at\\r\\nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys\\r\\nwere unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how\\r\\nHarry felt.\\r\\nHe missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant\\r\\nstomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and\\r\\nghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the\\r\\nmail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his\\r\\nfour-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper,\\r\\nHagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and,\\r\\nespecially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world\\r\\n(six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on\\r\\nbroomsticks).\\r\\nAll Harry\\'s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line\\r\\nNimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard\\r\\nunder the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home.\\r\\nWhat did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House\\r\\nQuidditch team because he hadn\\'t practiced all summer? What was it\\r\\nto the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his\\r\\nhomework done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles\\r\\n(not a drop of magical blood in their veins),\\r\\nand as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was\\r\\na matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked\\r\\nHarry\\'s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying\\r\\nmessages to anyone in the wizarding world.\\r\\nHarry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was\\r\\nlarge and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia\\r\\n4\\r\\nwas horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry,\\r\\non the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and\\r\\njet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on\\r\\nhis forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.\\r\\nIt was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a\\r\\nwizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry\\'s very mysterious past, of\\r\\nthe reason he had been left on the Dursleys\\' doorstep eleven years\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\nAt the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from\\r\\nthe greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name\\r\\nmost witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry\\'s parents had\\r\\ndied in Voldemort\\'s attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning\\r\\nscar, and somehow - nobody understood why Voldemort\\'s powers had\\r\\nbeen destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.\\r\\nSo Harry had been brought up by his dead mother\\'s sister and her\\r\\nhusband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never\\r\\nunderstanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning\\r\\nto, believing the Dursleys\\' story that he had got his scar in the car\\r\\ncrash that had killed his parents.\\r\\nAnd then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry,\\r\\nand the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at\\r\\nwizard school, where he and his scar were famous ... but now the\\r\\nschool year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the\\r\\nsummer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something\\r\\nsmelly.\\r\\nThe Dursleys hadn\\'t even remembered that today happened to be\\r\\nHarry\\'s twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn\\'t been high; they\\'d\\r\\nnever given him a real present, let alone a cake - but to ignore it\\r\\ncompletely ...\\r\\nAt that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said,\\r\\n\"Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.\"\\r\\nHarry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.\\r\\n\"This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, \"\\r\\n5\\r\\nsaid Uncle Vernon.\\r\\nHarry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Un\\r\\ncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He\\'d been talk\\r\\ning of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife\\r\\nwere coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge\\r\\norder from him (Uncle Vernon\\'s company made drills).\\r\\n\"I think we should run through the schedule one more time,\" said\\r\\nUncle Vernon. \"We should all be in position at eight o\\'clock. Petunia,\\r\\nyou will be -?\"\\r\\n\"In the lounge,\" said Aunt Petunia promptly, \"waiting to welcome them\\r\\ngraciously to our home.\"\\r\\n\"Good, good. And Dudley?\"\\r\\n\"I\\'ll be waiting to open the door.\" Dudley put on a foul, simpering\\r\\nsmile. \"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\"\\r\\n\"They\\'ll love him!\" cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.\\r\\n\"Excellent, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry.\\r\\n\"And you?\"\\r\\n\"I\\'ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I\\'m not\\r\\nthere,\" said Harry tonelessly.\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" said Uncle Vernon nastily. \"I will lead them into the\\r\\nlounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them -drinks. At eightfifteen\\r\\n-\"\\r\\n\"I\\'ll announce dinner,\" said Aunt Petunia.\\r\\n\"And, Dudley, you\\'ll say -\"\\r\\n\"May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?\" said\\r\\nDudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.\\r\\n\"My perfect little gentleman!\" sniffed Aunt Petunia.\\r\\n\"And you?\" said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.\\r\\n6\\r\\n\"I\\'ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I\\'m not there,\"\\r\\nsaid Harry dully.\\r\\n\"Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at\\r\\ndinner. Petunia, any ideas?\"\\r\\n\"Vernon tells me you\\'re a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason.... Do tell me\\r\\nwhere you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason ......\\r\\n\"Perfect. . . Dudley?\"\\r\\n\"How about -\\'We had to write an essay about our hero at school,\\r\\nMr. Mason, and I wrote about you.\"\\'\\r\\nThis was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia\\r\\nburst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the\\r\\ntable so they wouldn\\'t see him laughing.\\r\\n\"And you, boy?\"\\r\\nHarry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.\\r\\n\"I\\'ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I\\'m not there,\"\\r\\nhe said.\\r\\n\"Too right, you will,\" said Uncle Vernon forcefully. \"The Ma\\r\\nsons don\\'t know anything about you and it\\'s going to stay that way.\\r\\nWhen dinner\\'s over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for\\r\\ncoffee, Petunia, and I\\'ll bring the subject around to drills. With any\\r\\nluck, I\\'ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten.\\r\\nbe shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time to\\r\\nmorrow.\\r\\nHarry couldn\\'t feel too excited about this. He didn\\'t think the\\r\\nDursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on\\r\\nPrivet Drive.\\r\\n\"Right - I\\'m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for\\r\\nDudley and me. And you,\" he snarled at Harry. \"You stay out of\\r\\nyour aunt\\'s way while she\\'s cleaning.\"\\r\\nHarry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day.\\r\\nHe crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang\\r\\nunder his breath:\\r\\n7\\r\\n\"Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me. . .\\r\\nNo cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening\\r\\npretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had\\r\\nnever felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more\\r\\neven than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron\\r\\nWeasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn\\'t seem to be\\r\\nmissing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer,\\r\\neven though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and\\r\\nstay.\\r\\nCountless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking\\r\\nHedwig\\'s cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione\\r\\nwith a letter, but it wasn\\'t worth the risk. Underage wizards weren\\'t\\r\\nallowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn\\'t told the\\r\\nDursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them\\r\\nall into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the\\r\\ncupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first\\r\\ncouple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words\\r\\nunder his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast\\r\\nas his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and\\r\\nHermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that\\r\\neven taunting Dudley had lost its appeal - and now Ron and Hermione\\r\\nhad forgotten his birthday.\\r\\nWhat wouldn\\'t he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any\\r\\nwitch or wizard? He\\'d almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy,\\r\\nDraco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn\\'t all been a dream ....\\r\\nNot that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of\\r\\nlast term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord\\r\\nVoldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but\\r\\nhe was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power.\\r\\nHarry had slipped through Voldemort\\'s clutches for a second time, but\\r\\nit had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept\\r\\nwaking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where\\r\\nVoldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes\\r\\nHarry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been\\r\\nstaring absent-mindedly into the hedge - and the hedge was staring back.\\r\\nTwo enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.\\r\\nHarry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the\\r\\n8\\r\\nlawn.\\r\\n\"I know what day it is,\" sang Dudley, waddling toward him.\\r\\nThe huge eyes blinked and vanished.\\r\\n\"What?\" said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had\\r\\nbeen.\\r\\n\"I know what day it is,\" Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.\\r\\n\"Well done,\" said Harry. \"So you\\'ve finally learned the days of the\\r\\nweek.\"\\r\\n\"Today\\'s your birthday,\" sneered Dudley. \"How come you haven\\'t got\\r\\nany cards? Haven\\'t you even got friends at that freak place?\"\\r\\n\"Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,\" said\\r\\nHarry coolly.\\r\\nDudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat\\r\\nbottom.\\r\\n\"Why\\'re you staring at the hedge?\" he said suspiciously.\\r\\n\" I , m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on\\r\\nfire,\" said Harry.\\r\\nDudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.\\r\\n\"You c-can\\'t - Dad told you you\\'re not to do m-magic - he said he\\'ll\\r\\nchuck you out of the house - and you haven\\'t got anywhere else to go -\\r\\nyou haven\\'t got any friends to take you -\"\\r\\n\"Jiggery pokery!\" said Harry in a fierce voice. \"Hocus pocus squiggly\\r\\nwiggly -\"\\r\\n\"MUUUUUUM!\" howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed\\r\\nback toward the house. \"MUUUUM! He\\'s doing you know what!\"\\r\\nHarry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor\\r\\nthe hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn\\'t really\\r\\n9\\r\\ndone magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his\\r\\nhead with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with\\r\\nthe promise he wouldn\\'t eat again until he\\'d finished.\\r\\nWhile Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry\\r\\ncleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the\\r\\nflowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden\\r\\nbench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry\\r\\nknew he shouldn\\'t have risen to Dudley\\'s bait, but Dudley had said\\r\\nthe very thing Harry had been thinking himself... maybe he didn\\'t have\\r\\nany friends at Hogwarts ....\\r\\nWish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he\\r\\nspread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running\\r\\ndown his face.\\r\\nIt was half past seven ,in the evening when at last, exhausted, he\\r\\nheard Aunt Petunia calling him.\\r\\n\"Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!\"\\r\\nHarry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of\\r\\nthe fridge stood tonight\\'s pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream\\r\\nand sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.\\r\\n\"Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!\" snapped Aunt Petunia,\\r\\npointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen\\r\\ntable. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.\\r\\nHarry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The\\r\\nmoment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate.\\r\\n\"Upstairs! Hurry!\"\\r\\nAs he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a\\r\\nglimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jack\\r\\nets. He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the door\\r\\nbell rang and Uncle Vernon\\'s furious face appeared at the foot of\\r\\nthe stairs.\\r\\n\"Remember, boy - one sound -\"\\r\\nHarry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closed\\r\\nthe door, and turned to collapse on his bed.\\r\\nThe trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.\\r\\n10\\r\\nC H-H A P T E RR T W o\\r\\nI\\r\\nDOBBY\\'S WARNING\\r\\narry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The little\\r\\ncreature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the\\r\\nsize of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been\\r\\nwatching him out of the garden hedge that morning.\\r\\nAs they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley\\'s voice from the hall.\\r\\n\"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\"\\r\\nThe creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its\\r\\nlong, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing\\r\\nwhat looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes.\\r\\n\"Er - hello,\" said Harry nervously.\\r\\n\"Harry Potter!\" said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was\\r\\nsure would carry down the stairs. \"So long has Dobby wanted to meet\\r\\nyou, sir ... Such an honor it is . . . .\"\\r\\n\"Th-thank you,\" said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his\\r\\ndesk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. He\\r\\nwanted to ask, \"What are you?\" but thought it would sound too rude,\\r\\nso instead he said, \"Who are you?\"\\r\\n\"Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,\" said the creature.\\r\\n\"Oh - really?\" said Harry. \"Er - I don\\'t want to be rude or anything,\\r\\nbut - this isn\\'t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my\\r\\nbedroom.\"\\r\\nAunt Petunias high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elf\\r\\nhung his head.\\r\\n\"Not that I\\'m not pleased to meet you,\" said Harry quickly, \"but, er,\\r\\nis there any particular reason you\\'re here?\"\\r\\n11\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, sir,\" said Dobby earnestly. \"Dobby has come to tell you,\\r\\nsir ... it is difficult, sir ... Dobby wonders where to begin . . . .\"\\r\\n\"Sit down,\" said Harry politely, pointing at the bed.\\r\\nTo his horror, the elf burst into tears - very noisy tears.\\r\\n\"S-sit down!\" he wailed. \"Never ... never ever. . . \"\\r\\nHarry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" he whispered, \"I didn\\'t mean to offend you or anything -\"\\r\\n\"Offend Dobby!\" choked the elf. \"Dobby has never been asked to sit\\r\\ndown by a wizard - like an equal-\"\\r\\nHarry, trying to say \"Shh!\" and look comforting at the same time,\\r\\nushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, looking\\r\\nlike a large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to control himself,\\r\\nand sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery\\r\\nadoration.\\r\\n\"You can\\'t have met many decent wizards,\" said Harry, trying to\\r\\ncheer him up.\\r\\nDobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and\\r\\nstarted banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, \"Bad\\r\\nDobby! Bad Dobby!\"\\r\\n\"Don\\'t - what are you doing?\" Harry hissed, springing up and pulling\\r\\nDobby back onto the bed - Hedwig had woken up with a\\r\\nparticularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the\\r\\nbars of her cage.\\r\\n\"Dobby had to punish himself, sir,\" said the elf, who had gone slightly\\r\\ncross-eyed. \"Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir . . . .\"\\r\\n\"Your family?\"\\r\\n\"The wizard family Dobby serves, sir... DOBBY\\'S is a houseelf -\\r\\nbound to serve one house and one family forever . .....\\r\\n12\\r\\n\"Do they know you\\'re here?\" asked Harry curiously.\\r\\nDobby shuddered.\\r\\n\"Oh, no, sir, no ... Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously\\r\\nfor coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the\\r\\noven door for this. If they ever knew, sir _\"\\r\\n\"But won\\'t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?\"\\r\\n\"Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for\\r\\nsomething, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they\\r\\nreminds me to do extra punishments ......\\r\\n\"But why don\\'t you leave? Escape?\"\\r\\n\"A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set\\r\\nDobby free ... Dobby will serve the family until he dies, sir . . . .\"\\r\\nHarry stared.\\r\\n\"And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,\"\\r\\nhe said. \"This makes the Dursleys sound almost human. Can\\'t anyone\\r\\nhelp you? Can\\'t I?\"\\r\\nAlmost at once, Harry wished he hadn\\'t spoken. Dobby dissolved again\\r\\ninto wails of gratitude.\\r\\n\"Please,\" Harry whispered frantically, \"please be quiet. If the Dursleys\\r\\nhear anything, if they know you\\'re here -\"\\r\\n\"Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby ... Dobby has heard of your\\r\\ngreatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew . .....\\r\\nHarry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, \"Whatever\\r\\nyou\\'ve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. I\\'m not even top\\r\\nof my year at Hogwarts; that\\'s Hermione, she -\"\\r\\nBut he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful.\\r\\n13\\r\\n\"I-Tarry Potter is humble and modest,\" said Dobby reverently, his orblike\\r\\neyes aglow. \"Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-\\r\\nMust-Not-Be-Named -\"\\r\\n\"Voldemort?\" said Harry.\\r\\nDobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, \"Ah, speak not\\r\\nthe name, sir! Speak not the name!\"\\r\\n\"Sorry\" said Harry quickly. \"I know lots of people don\\'t like it. My\\r\\nfriend Ron -\"\\r\\nHe stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.\\r\\nDobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.\\r\\n\\'Dobby heard tell,\" he said hoarsely, \"that Harry Potter met the Dark\\r\\nLord for a second time just weeks ago ... that Harry Potter escaped\\r\\nYet again. \"\\r\\nHarry nodded and Dobby\\'s eyes suddenly shone with tears.\\r\\n,Ah, sir,\" he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby\\r\\npillowcase he was wearing. \"Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has\\r\\nbraved so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect\\r\\nHarry Potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in\\r\\nthe oven door later... Harry Potter must notgo back to Hogwarts.\"\\r\\nThere was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks\\r\\nfrom downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon\\'s voice.\\r\\n\"W-what?\" Harry stammered. \"But I\\'ve got to go back - term starts\\r\\non September first. It\\'s all that\\'s keeping me going. You don\\'t know\\r\\nwhat it\\'s like here. I don\\'t belong here. I belong in your world - at\\r\\nHogwarts.\"\\r\\n\"No, no, no,\" squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears\\r\\nflapped. \"Harry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great,\\r\\ntoo good, to lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be\\r\\nin mortal danger.\"\\r\\n14\\r\\n\"Why?\" said Harry in surprise.\\r\\n\"There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things\\r\\nhappen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,\"\\r\\nwhispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over. \"Dobby has known it\\r\\nfor months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is too\\r\\nimportant, sir!\"\\r\\n\"What terrible things?\" said Harry at once. \"Who\\'s plotting them?\"\\r\\nDobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head\\r\\nfrantically against the wall.\\r\\n\"All right!\" cried Harry, grabbing the elf\\'s arm to stop him. \"You can\\'t\\r\\ntell me. I understand. But why are you warning me?\" A sudden,\\r\\nunpleasant thought struck him. \"Hang on - this hasn\\'t got anything to\\r\\ndo with Vol- - sorry - with You-Know-Who, has it?\\r\\nYou could just shake or nod,\" he added hastily as Dobby\\'s head\\r\\ntilted worryingly close to the wall again.\\r\\nSlowly, Dobby shook his head.\\r\\n\"Not -not He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir =\\'\\r\\nBut Dobby\\'s eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give\\r\\nHarry a hint. Harry, however, was completely lost.\\r\\n\"He hasn\\'t got a brother, has he?\"\\r\\nDobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.\\r\\n\"Well then, I can\\'t think who else would have a chance of making\\r\\nhorrible things happen at Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I mean, there\\'s\\r\\nDumbledore, for one thing - you know who Dumbledore is, don\\'t\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\nDobby bowed his head.\\r\\n\"Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever\\r\\nhad. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore\\'s powers\\r\\nrival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his\\r\\n15\\r\\nstrength. But, sir\" - Dobby\\'s voice dropped to an urgent whisper -\\r\\n\"there are powers Dumbledore doesn\\'t ... powers no decent wizard.\\r\\n. .\"\\r\\nAnd before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed,\\r\\nseized Harry\\'s desk lamp, and started beating himself around the\\r\\nhead with earsplitting yelps.\\r\\nA sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart\\r\\nthudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling,\\r\\n\"Dudley must have left his television on again, the little tyke!\"\\r\\n\"Quick! In the closet!\" hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting the\\r\\ndoor, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned.\\r\\n\"What - the - devil - are - you - doing?\" said Uncle Vernon through\\r\\ngritted teeth, his face horribly close to Harry\\'s. \"You\\'ve just ruined the\\r\\npunch line of my Japanese golfer joke .... One more sound and you\\'ll\\r\\nwish you\\'d never been born, boy!\"\\r\\nHe stomped flat-footed from the room.\\r\\nShaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet.\\r\\n\"See what it\\'s like here?\" he said. \"See why I\\'ve got to go back to\\r\\nHogwarts? It\\'s the only place I\\'ve got -well, I think I\\'ve got friends. \"\\r\\n\"Friends who don\\'t even write to Harry Potter?\" said Dobby slyly.\\r\\n\"I expect they\\'ve just been - wait a minute,\" said Harry, frowning.\\r\\n\"How do you know my friends haven\\'t been writing to me?\"\\r\\nDobby shuffled his feet.\\r\\n\"Harry Potter mustn\\'t be angry with Dobby. Dobby did it for the best -\\r\\n\"\\r\\n\"Have you been stopping my letters?\"\\r\\n\"Dobby has them here, sir,\" said the elf. Stepping nimbly out of Harry\\'s\\r\\nreach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the\\r\\npillowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out Hermione\\'s neat\\r\\n16\\r\\nwriting, Ron\\'s untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though\\r\\nit was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid.\\r\\nDobby blinked anxiously up at Harry.\\r\\n\"Harry Potter mustn\\'t be angry... Dobby hoped ... if Harry Potter\\r\\nthought his friends had forgotten him ... Harry Potter might not want to\\r\\ngo back to school, sir . .....\\r\\nHarry wasn\\'t listening. He made a grab for the letters, but Dobby\\r\\njumped out of reach.\\r\\n\"Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his word\\r\\nthat he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you must\\r\\nnot face! Say you won\\'t go back, sir!\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry angrily. \"Give me my friends\\' letters!\"\\r\\n\"Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,\" said the elf sadly.\\r\\nBefore Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the bedroom door,\\r\\npulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs.\\r\\nMouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying not to\\r\\nmake a sound. He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the\\r\\nhall carpet, looking around for Dobby. From the dining room he\\r\\nheard Uncle Vernon saying, \". . . tell Petunia that very funny story\\r\\nabout those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. She\\'s been dying to\\r\\nhear. . . \"\\r\\nHarry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear.\\r\\nAunt Petunia\\'s masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and\\r\\nsugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. On top of a\\r\\ncupboard in the corner crouched Dobby.\\r\\n\"No,\" croaked Harry. \"Please ... they\\'ll kill me ......\\r\\n\"Harry Potter must say he\\'s not going back to school -\"\\r\\n\"Dobby ... please ...\\r\\n17\\r\\n\"Say it, sir -\"\\r\\n\"I can\\'t -\"\\r\\nDobby gave him a tragic look.\\r\\n\"Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter\\'s own good.\"\\r\\nThe pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. Cream\\r\\nsplattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a crack\\r\\nlike a whip, Dobby vanished.\\r\\nThere were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon\\r\\nburst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head\\r\\nto foot in Aunt Petunias pudding.\\r\\nAt first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the\\r\\nwhole thing over. (\"Just our nephew - very disturbed meeting strangers\\r\\nupsets him, so we kept him upstairs) He shooed the shocked Masons\\r\\nback into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to within\\r\\nan inch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop.\\r\\nAunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry, still\\r\\nshaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean.\\r\\nUncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal - if it hadn\\'t\\r\\nbeen for the owl.\\r\\nAunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints when\\r\\na huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a\\r\\nletter on Mrs. Mason\\'s head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason\\r\\nscreamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about\\r\\nlunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his\\r\\nwife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask\\r\\nwhether this was their idea of a joke.\\r\\nHarry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as Uncle\\r\\nVernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes.\\r\\n\"Read it!\" he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered.\\r\\n\"Go on - read it!\"\\r\\n18\\r\\nHarry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings.\\r\\nDear Mr. Potter,\\r\\nWe have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your\\r\\nplace of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine.\\r\\nAs you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells\\r\\noutside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to\\r\\nexpulsion from said school (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of\\r\\nUnderage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C).\\r\\nWe would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that\\r\\nrisks notice by members of the non-magical community (Muggles) is\\r\\na serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation\\r\\nof Warlocks\\' Statute of Secrecy.\\r\\nEnjoy your holidays! Yours sincerely,\\r\\nMafalda Hopkirk\\r\\nIMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE\\r\\nMinistry of Magic\\r\\nHarry looked up from the letter and gulped.\\r\\n\"You didn\\'t tell us you weren\\'t allowed to use magic outside school,\"\\r\\nsaid Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. \"For got to\\r\\nmention it .... Slipped your mind, I daresay .....\\r\\nHe was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth\\r\\nbared. \"Well, I\\'ve got news for you, boy . ... I\\'m locking you up ....\\r\\nYou\\'re never going back to that school ... never ... and if you try and\\r\\nmagic yourself out - they\\'ll expel you!\"\\r\\nAnd laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs.\\r\\nUncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning,\\r\\n19\\r\\nhe paid a man to fit bars on Harry\\'s window. He himself fitted a catflap\\r\\nin the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be\\r\\npushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the\\r\\nbathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room\\r\\naround the clock.\\r\\nThree days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, and\\r\\nHarry couldn\\'t see any way out of his situation. He lay on his bed\\r\\nwatching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered\\r\\nmiserably what was going to happen to him.\\r\\nWhat was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts\\r\\nwould expel him for doing it? Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an\\r\\nall-time low. Now that the Dursleys knew they weren\\'t going to wake\\r\\nup as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might have saved\\r\\nHarry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were\\r\\ngoing, he\\'d probably starve to death anyway.\\r\\nThe cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowl\\r\\nof canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with\\r\\nhunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-cold, but\\r\\nhe drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig\\'s\\r\\ncage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into\\r\\nher empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of\\r\\ndeep disgust.\\r\\n\"It\\'s no good turning your beak up at it - that\\'s all we\\'ve got,\" said\\r\\nHarry grimly.\\r\\nHe put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay\\r\\nback down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been\\r\\nbefore the soup.\\r\\nSupposing he was still alive in another four weeks, what would happen\\r\\nif he didn\\'t turn up at Hogwarts? Would someone be sent to see why\\r\\nhe hadn\\'t come back? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let\\r\\nhim go?\\r\\nThe room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind\\r\\nspinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into an\\r\\nuneasy sleep.\\r\\n20\\r\\nHe dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card reading\\r\\nUNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage. People goggled through the bars\\r\\nat him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He saw\\r\\nDobby\\'s face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but Dobby\\r\\ncalled, \"Harry Potter is safe there, sir!\" and vanished. Then the\\r\\nDursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\"Stop it,\" Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head.\\r\\n\"Leave me alone ... cut it out ... I\\'m trying to sleep . . . .\"\\r\\nHe opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through the bars on the\\r\\nwindow. And someone was goggling through the bars at him: a frecklefaced,\\r\\nred-haired, long-nosed someone.\\r\\nRon Weasley was outside Harry\\'s window.\\r\\n21\\r\\nH-H A P T E RR T 11-H RR E E\\r\\nTHE BURROW\\r\\nRon.l\" breathed Harry, creeping to the window and pushing it up so\\r\\nthey could talk through the bars. \"Ron, how did you - What the -?\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit\\r\\nhim. Ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car,\\r\\nwhich was parked in midair Grinning at Harry from the front seats\\r\\nwere Fred and George, Ron\\'s elder twin brothers.\\r\\n\"All right, Harry?\" asked George.\\r\\n\"What\\'s been going on?\" said Ron. \"Why haven\\'t you been answering\\r\\nmy letters? I\\'ve asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad\\r\\ncame home and said you\\'d got an official warning for using magic in\\r\\nfront of Muggles -\"\\r\\n\"It wasn\\'t me - and how did he know?\"\\r\\n\"He works for the Ministry,\" said Ron. \"You know we\\'re not supposed\\r\\nto do spells outside school -\"\\r\\n\"You should talk,\" said Harry, staring at the floating car.\\r\\n\"Oh, this doesn\\'t count,\" said Ron. \"We\\'re only borrowing this. It\\'s\\r\\nDad\\'s, we didn\\'t enchant it. But doing magic in front of those Muggles\\r\\nyou live with -\"\\r\\n\"I told you, I didn\\'t - but it\\'ll take too long to explain now look, can you\\r\\ntell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won\\'t\\r\\nlet me come back, and obviously I can\\'t magic myself out, because the\\r\\nMinistry\\'Il think that\\'s the second spell I\\'ve done in three days, so -\"\\r\\n\"Stop gibbering,\" said Ron. \"We\\'ve come to take you home with us.\"\\r\\n\"But you can\\'t magic me out either -\"\\r\\n22\\r\\n\"We don\\'t need to,\" said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seat\\r\\nand grinning. \"You forget who I\\'ve got with me.\"\\r\\n\"Tie that around the bars,\" said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\n\"If the Dursleys wake up, I\\'m dead,\" said Harry as he tied the rope\\r\\ntightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t worry,\" said Fred, \"and stand back.\"\\r\\nHarry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to\\r\\nhave realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car\\r\\nrevved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the\\r\\nbars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in\\r\\nthe air. Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few\\r\\nfeet above the ground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car.\\r\\nHarry listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the Dursleys\\'\\r\\nbedroom.\\r\\nWhen the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed\\r\\nas close as possible to Harry\\'s window.\\r\\n\"Get in,\" Ron said.\\r\\n\"But all my Hogwarts stuff - my wand - my broomstick -\"\\r\\n\"Where is it?\"\\r\\n\"Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can\\'t get out of this\\r\\nroom -\"\\r\\n\"No problem,\" said George from the front passenger seat. \"Out of\\r\\nthe way, Harry.\"\\r\\nFred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry\\'s\\r\\nroom. You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took an\\r\\nordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock.\\r\\n\"A lot of wizards think it\\'s a waste of time, knowing this sort of\\r\\nMuggle trick,\" said Fred, \"but we feel they\\'re skills worth learning,\\r\\neven if they are a bit slow.\"\\r\\n23\\r\\nThere was a small click and the door swung open.\\r\\n\"So - we\\'ll get your trunk - you grab anything you need from your\\r\\nroom and hand it out to Ron,\" whispered George.\\r\\n\"Watch out for the bottom stair - it creaks,\" Harry whispered back\\r\\nas the twins disappeared onto the dark landing.\\r\\nHarry dashed around his room, collecting his things and passing them\\r\\nout of the window to Ron. Then he went to help Fred and George\\r\\nheave his trunk up the stairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough.\\r\\nAt last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk\\r\\nthrough Harry\\'s room to the open window. Fred climbed back into\\r\\nthe car to pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the\\r\\nbedroom side. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window.\\r\\nUncle Vernon coughed again.\\r\\n\"A bit more,\" panted Fred, who was pulling from inside the car.\\r\\n\"One good push -\"\\r\\nHarry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid\\r\\nout of the window into the back seat of the car.\\r\\n\"Okay, let\\'s go,\" George whispered.\\r\\nBut as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud\\r\\nscreech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder of\\r\\nUncle Vernon\\'s voice.\\r\\n\"THAT RUDDY OWL!\"\\r\\n\"I\\'ve forgotten Hedwig!\"\\r\\nHarry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on - he\\r\\nsnatched up Hedwig\\'s cage, dashed to the window, and passed it\\r\\nout to Ron. He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when\\r\\nUncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open.\\r\\nFor a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway; then\\r\\n24\\r\\nhe let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry, grabbing\\r\\nhim by the ankle.\\r\\nRon, Fred, and George seized Harry\\'s arms and pulled as hard as\\r\\nthey could.\\r\\n\"Petunia!\" roared Uncle Vernon. \"He\\'s getting away! HE\\'S\\r\\nGETTING AWAY!\"\\r\\nBut the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry\\'s leg slid out of\\r\\nUncle Vernon\\'s grasp - Harry was in the car - he\\'d slammed the\\r\\ndoor shut\\r\\n\"Put your foot down, Fred!\" yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly\\r\\ntoward the moon.\\r\\nHarry couldn\\'t believe it - he was free. He rolled down the\\r\\nwindow, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at the\\r\\nshrinking rooftops of Privet Drive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and\\r\\nDudley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry\\'s window.\\r\\n\"See you next summer!\" Harry yelled.\\r\\nThe Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat,\\r\\ngrinning from ear to ear.\\r\\n\"Let Hedwig out,\" he told Ron. \"She can fly behind us. She hasn\\'t had\\r\\na chance to stretch her wings for ages.\"\\r\\nGeorge handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment later, Hedwig soared\\r\\njoyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost.\\r\\n\"So - what\\'s the story, Harry?\" said Ron impatiently. \"What\\'s been\\r\\nhappening?\"\\r\\nHarry told them all about Dobby, the warning he\\'d given Harry and\\r\\nthe fiasco of the violet pudding. There was a long, shocked silence\\r\\nwhen he had finished.\\r\\n\"Very fishy,\" said Fred finally.\\r\\n25\\r\\n\"Definitely dodgy\" agreed George. \"So he wouldn\\'t even tell you who\\'s\\r\\nsupposed to be plotting all this stuff?\"\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think he could,\" said Harry. \"I told you, every time he got close\\r\\nto letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall.\"\\r\\nHe saw Fred and George look at each other.\\r\\n\"What, you think he was lying to me?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Fred, \"put it this way - house-elves have got powerful\\r\\nmagic of their own, but they can\\'t usually use it without their master\\'s\\r\\npermission. I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you com\\r\\ning back to Hogwarts. Someone\\'s idea of a joke. Can you think of\\r\\nanyone at school with a grudge against you?\"\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry and Ron together, instantly.\\r\\n\"Draco Malfoy,\" Harry explained. \"He hates me.\"\\r\\n\"Draco Malfoy?\" said George, turning around. \"Not Lucius Malfoy\\'s\\r\\nson?\"\\r\\n\"Must be, it\\'s not a very common name, is it?\" said Harry.\\r\\nY.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve heard Dad talking about him,\" said George. \"He was a big\\r\\nsupporter of You-Know-Who.\"\\r\\n\"And when You-Know-Who disappeared,\" said Fred, craning\\r\\naround to look at Harry, \"Lucius Malfoy came back saying he\\'d never\\r\\nmeant any of it. Load of dung - Dad reckons he was right in You-\\r\\nKnow-Who\\'s inner circle.\"\\r\\nHarry had heard these rumors about Malfoy\\'s family before, and they\\r\\ndidn\\'t surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look\\r\\nlike a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf said\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\n26\\r\\n\"Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they\\'ll\\r\\nbe rich,\" said Fred.\\r\\n\"Yeah, Mum\\'s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,\"\\r\\nsaid George. \"But all we\\'ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and\\r\\ngnomes all over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors\\r\\nand castles and places like that; you wouldn\\'t catch one in our house .\\r\\n. . .\"\\r\\nHarry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had\\r\\nthe best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he\\r\\ncould just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending\\r\\nthe family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also\\r\\nsounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry\\r\\nbeen stupid to take Dobby seriously?\\r\\n\"I\\'m glad we came to get you, anyway,\" said Ron. \"I was getting\\r\\nreally worried when you didn\\'t answer any of my letters. I thought it\\r\\nwas Errol\\'s fault at first\\r\\n-\"\\r\\n\"Who\\'s Errol?\"\\r\\n\"Our owl. He\\'s ancient. It wouldn\\'t be the first time he\\'d collapsed\\r\\non a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes -\"\\r\\n\"Who?\"\\r\\n\"The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect,\"\\r\\nsaid Fred from the front.\\r\\n\"But Percy wouldn\\'t lend him to me,\" said Ron. \"Said he needed\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\"Percy\\'s been acting very oddly this summer,\" said George,\\r\\nfrowning. \"And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a\\r\\nload of time shut up in his room .... I mean, there\\'s only so many\\r\\ntimes you can polish a prefect badge .... You\\'re driving too far west,\\r\\nFred,\" he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. Fred\\r\\n27\\r\\ntwiddled the steering wheel.\\r\\n\"So, does your dad know you\\'ve got the car?\" said Harry, guessing\\r\\nthe answer.\\r\\n\"Er, no,\" said Ron, \"he had to work tonight. Hopefully we\\'ll be able\\r\\nto get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.\"\\r\\n\"What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway?\"\\r\\n\"He works in the most boring department,\" said Ron. \"The Misuse\\r\\nof Muggle Artifacts Office.\"\\r\\n\"The what?\"\\r\\n\"It\\'s all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made, you\\r\\nknow, in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house. Like,\\r\\nlast year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques\\r\\nshop. This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serve\\r\\nher friends tea in it. It was a nightmare - Dad was working overtime\\r\\nfor weeks.\"\\r\\n\"What happened?\"\\r\\n\"The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place\\r\\nand one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped\\r\\nto his nose. Dad was going frantic - it\\'s only him and an old warlock\\r\\ncalled Perkins in the office -and they had to do Memory Charms and\\r\\nall sorts of stuff to cover it up -\"\\r\\n\"But your dad - this car -\"\\r\\nFred laughed. \"Yeah, Dad\\'s crazy about everything to do with\\r\\nMuggles; our shed\\'s full of Muggle stuff. He takes it apart, puts spells\\r\\non it, and puts it back together again. If he raided our house he\\'d\\r\\nhave to put himself under arrest. It drives Mum mad.\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s the main road,\" said George, peering down through the\\r\\nwindshield. \"We\\'ll be there in ten minutes .... Just as well, it\\'s getting\\r\\nlight . . . .\"\\r\\nA faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east.\\r\\n28\\r\\nFred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark patchwork of\\r\\nfields and clumps of trees.\\r\\n\"We\\'re a little way outside the village,\" said George. \"Ottery St.\\r\\nCatchpole.\"\\r\\nLower and lower went the flying car. The edge of a brilliant red sun\\r\\nwas now gleaming through the trees.\\r\\n\"Touchdown!\" said Fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground.\\r\\nThey had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and\\r\\nHarry looked out for the first time at Ron\\'s house.\\r\\nIt looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra\\r\\nrooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high\\r\\nand so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which,\\r\\nHarry reminded himself, it probably was). Four or five chimneys were\\r\\nperched on top of the red roof. A lopsided sign stuck in the ground\\r\\nnear the entrance read, THE BuRRow. Around the front door lay a jumble\\r\\nof rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron. Several fat brown chickens\\r\\nwere pecking their way around the yard.\\r\\n\"It\\'s not much,\" said Ron.\\r\\n\"It\\'s wonderful,\" said Harry happily, thinking of Privet Drive.\\r\\nThey got out of the car.\\r\\n\"Now, we\\'ll go upstairs really quietly,\" said Fred, \"and wait for Mum to\\r\\ncall us for breakfast Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going,\\r\\n`Mum, look who turned up in the night!\\' and she\\'ll be all pleased to see\\r\\nHarry and no one need ever know we flew the car.\"\\r\\n\"Right,\" said Ron. \"Come on, Harry, I sleep at the - at the top\\r\\nRon had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house. The\\r\\nother three wheeled around.\\r\\nMrs. Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, and\\r\\nfor a short, plump, kind-faced woman, it was remarkable how much\\r\\nshe looked like a saber-toothed tiger.\\r\\n29\\r\\n\"Ah, \"said Fred.\\r\\n\"Oh, dear,\" said George.\\r\\nMrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips,\\r\\nstaring from one guilty face to the next. She was wearing a flowered\\r\\napron with a wand sticking out of the pocket.\\r\\n\"So, \"she said.\\r\\n\"Morning, Mum,\" said George, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty,\\r\\nwinning voice.\\r\\n\"Have you any idea how worried I\\'ve been?\" said Mrs. Weasley in a\\r\\ndeadly whisper.\\r\\n\"Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to -\"\\r\\nAll three of Mrs. Weasley\\'s sons were taller than she was, but they\\r\\ncowered as her rage broke over them.\\r\\n\"Beds empty! No note! Cargone - could have crashed - out of my\\r\\nmind with worry - did you care? - never, as long as I\\'ve lived -\\r\\nyou wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this\\r\\nfrom Bill or Charlie or Percy -\"\\r\\n\"Perfect Percy,\" muttered Fred.\\r\\n\"YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY\\'S\\r\\nBOOK!\" yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred\\'s chest. \"You\\r\\ncould have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your\\r\\nfather his job -\"\\r\\nIt seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself\\r\\nhoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away.\\r\\n\"I\\'m very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,\" she said. \"Come in and\\r\\nhave some breakfast.\"\\r\\nShe turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous\\r\\n30\\r\\nglance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her.\\r\\nThe kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a\\r\\nscrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down\\r\\non the edge of his seat, looking around. He had never been in a wizard\\r\\nhouse before.\\r\\nThe clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers\\r\\nat all. Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time\\r\\nto feed the chickens, and You\\'re late. Books were stacked three deep on\\r\\nthe mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese,\\r\\nEnchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts - It\\'s Magic! And unless\\r\\nHarry\\'s ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just\\r\\nannounced that coming up was \"Witching Hour, with the popular\\r\\nsinging sorceress, Celestina Warbeck.\"\\r\\nMrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little\\r\\nhaphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages\\r\\ninto the frying pan. Every now and then she muttered things like \"don\\'t\\r\\nknow what you were thinking of,\" and \"never would have believed it.\"\\r\\n\"I don\\'t blame you, dear,\" she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine\\r\\nsausages onto his plate. \"Arthur and I have been worried about you,\\r\\ntoo. Just last night we were saying we\\'d come and get you ourselves if\\r\\nyou hadn\\'t written back to Ron by Friday. But really,\" (she was now\\r\\nadding three fried eggs to his plate) \"flying an illegal car halfway\\r\\nacross the country - anyone could have seen you -\"\\r\\nShe flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began to\\r\\nclean themselves, clinking gently in the background.\\r\\n\"It was cloudy, Mum!\" said Fred.\\r\\n\"You keep your mouth closed while you\\'re eating!\" Mrs. Weasley\\r\\nsnapped.\\r\\n\"They were starving him, Mum!\" said George.\\r\\n\"And you!\" said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened\\r\\nexpression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n31\\r\\nAt that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small,\\r\\nredheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen,\\r\\ngave a small squeal, and ran out again.\\r\\n\"Ginny,\" said Ron in an undertone to Harry. \"My sister. She\\'s been\\r\\ntalking about you all summer.\"\\r\\n\"Yeah, she\\'ll be wanting your autograph, Harry,\" Fred said with a grin,\\r\\nbut he caught his mother\\'s eye and bent his face over his plate without\\r\\nanother word. Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean,\\r\\nwhich took a surprisingly short time.\\r\\n\"Blimey, I\\'m tired,\" yawned Fred, setting down his knife and fork at last.\\r\\n\"I think I\\'ll go to bed and -\"\\r\\n\"You will not,\" snapped Mrs. Weasley. \"It\\'s your own fault you\\'ve\\r\\nbeen up all night. You\\'re going to de-gnome the garden for me; they\\'re\\r\\ngetting completely out of hand again -\"\\r\\n\"Oh, Mum -\"\\r\\n\"And you two,\" she said, glaring at Ron and Fred. \"You can go up to\\r\\nbed, dear,\" she added to Harry. \"You didn\\'t ask them to fly that\\r\\nwretched car -\"\\r\\nBut Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, \"I\\'ll help Ron. I\\'ve\\r\\nnever seen a de-gnoming -\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s very sweet of you, dear, but it\\'s dull work,\" said Mrs. Weasley.\\r\\n\"Now, let\\'s see what Lockhart\\'s got to say on the subject -\"\\r\\nAnd she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece.\\r\\nGeorge groaned.\\r\\n\"Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden -\"\\r\\nHarry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley\\'s book. Written across it\\r\\nin fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s Guide to\\r\\nHousehold Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very good-\\r\\nIOI)king wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As always\\r\\nin the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who\\r\\n32\\r\\nHarry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at\\r\\nthem all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him.\\r\\n\"Oh, he is marvelous,\" she said. \"He knows his household pests, all\\r\\nright, it\\'s a wonderful book . . . .\"\\r\\n\"Mum fancies him,\" said Fred, in a very audible whisper.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be so ridiculous, Fred,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks rather\\r\\npink. \"All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go\\r\\nand get on with it, and woe betide you if there\\'s a single gnome in that\\r\\ngarden when I come out to inspect it.\"\\r\\nYawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry\\r\\nbehind them. The garden was large, and in Harry\\'s eyes, exactlY\\r\\nwhat a garden should be. The Dursleys wouldn\\'t have liked it - there\\r\\nwere plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting but there were\\r\\ngnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling\\r\\nfrom every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs.\\r\\n\"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,\" Harry told Ron\\r\\nthey crossed the lawn.\\r\\n\"Yeah, I\\'ve seen those things they think are gnomes,\" said Ron, bent\\r\\ndouble with his head in a peony bush, \"like fat little Santa Clauses with\\r\\nfishing rods . . . .\"\\r\\nThere was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and\\r\\nRon straightened up. \"This is a gnome,\" he said grimly.\\r\\n\"Gerroff me! Gerroff me!\" squealed the gnome.\\r\\nIt was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery\\r\\nlooking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron held\\r\\nit at arm\\'s length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he\\r\\ngrasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down.\\r\\n\"This is what you have to do,\" he said. He raised the gnome above his\\r\\nhead (\"Gerroff me!\") and started to swing it in great circles like a\\r\\nlasso. Seeing the shocked look on Harry\\'s face, Ron added, \"It doesn\\'t\\r\\nhurt them - you\\'ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can\\'t find\\r\\n33\\r\\ntheir way back to the gnomeholes.\"\\r\\nHe let go of the gnome\\'s ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and\\r\\nlanded with a thud in the field over the hedge.\\r\\n\"Pitiful,\" said Fred. \"I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.\"\\r\\nHarry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decided\\r\\njust to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome,\\r\\nsensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry\\'s finger and he\\r\\nhad a hard job shaking it off - until\\r\\n\"Wow, Harry - that must\\'ve been fifty feet ......\\r\\nThe air was soon thick with flying gnomes.\\r\\n\"See, they\\'re not too bright,\" said George, seizing five or six gnomes at\\r\\nonce. \"The moment they know the de-gnoming\\'s going on they storm\\r\\nup to have a look. You\\'d think they\\'d have learned by now just to stay\\r\\nput.\"\\r\\nSoon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a\\r\\nstraggling line, their little shoulders hunched.\\r\\n\"They\\'ll be back,\" said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into\\r\\nthe hedge on the other side of the field. \"They love it here .... Dad\\'s\\r\\ntoo soft with them; he thinks they\\'re funny . . . .\"\\r\\nJust then, the front door slammed.\\r\\n\"He\\'s back!\" said George. \"Dad\\'s home!\"\\r\\nThey hurried through the garden and back into the house.\\r\\nMr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and\\r\\nhis eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he\\r\\nhad was as red as any of his children\\'s. He was wearing long green\\r\\nrobes, which were dusty and travel-worn.\\r\\n\"What a night,\" he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat\\r\\ndown around him. \"Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher\\r\\ntried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned ......\\r\\n34\\r\\nMr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed.\\r\\n\"Find anything, Dad?\" said Fred eagerly.\\r\\n\"All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,\" yawned\\r\\nMr. Weasley. \"There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn\\'t my\\r\\ndepartment, though. Mortlake was taken away for questioning about\\r\\nsome extremely odd ferrets, but that\\'s the Committee on Experimental\\r\\nCharms, thank goodness ......\\r\\n\"Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?\" said George.\\r\\n\"Just Muggle-baiting,\" sighed Mr. Weasley. \"Sell them a key that\\r\\nkeeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it\\r\\n.... Of course, it\\'s very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle\\r\\nwould admit their key keeps shrinking - they\\'ll insist they just keep\\r\\nlosing it. Bless them, they\\'ll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if\\r\\nit\\'s staring them in the face .... But the things our lot have taken to\\r\\nenchanting, you wouldn\\'t believe -\"\\r\\n\"LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?\"\\r\\nMrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr.\\r\\nWeasley\\'s eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife.\\r\\n\"C-cars, Molly, dear?\"\\r\\n\"Yes, Arthur, cars,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing. \"Imagine a\\r\\nwizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do\\r\\nwith it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was\\r\\nenchanting it to make it fly.\"\\r\\nMr. Weasley blinked.\\r\\n\"Well, dear, I think you\\'ll find that he would be quite within the law to\\r\\ndo that, even if - er - he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his\\r\\nwife the truth .... There\\'s a loophole in the law, you\\'ll find .... As long\\r\\nas he wasn\\'t intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly\\r\\nwouldn\\'t -\"\\r\\n\"Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you\\r\\n35\\r\\nwrote that law!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"Just so you could carry on\\r\\ntinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for your\\r\\ninformation, Harry arrived this morning in the car you weren\\'t\\r\\nintending to fly!\"\\r\\n\"Harry?\" said Mr. Weasley blankly. \"Harry who?\"\\r\\nHe looked around, saw Harry, and jumped.\\r\\n\"Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet you, Ron\\'s told us\\r\\nso much about -\"\\r\\n\"Your sons flew that car to Harry\\'s house and back last night.\"\\r\\nshouted Mrs. Weasley. \"What have you got to say about that, eh?\"\\r\\n\"Did you really?\" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \"Did it go all right? I - I\\r\\nmean,\" he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasley\\'s eyes, \"that -\\r\\nthat was very wrong, boys - very wrong indeed ......\\r\\n\"Let\\'s leave them to it,\" Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs. Weasley\\r\\nswelled like a bullfrog. \"Come on, I\\'ll show you my bedroom.\"\\r\\nThey slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an\\r\\nuneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up\\r\\nthrough the house. On the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry just\\r\\ncaught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it\\r\\nclosed with a snap.\\r\\n\"Ginny,\" said Ron. \"You don\\'t know how weird it is for her to be this\\r\\nshy. She never shuts up normally -\"\\r\\nThey climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling\\r\\npaint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALD\\'S ROOM.\\r\\nHarry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and\\r\\nblinked. It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron\\'s\\r\\nroom seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the\\r\\nwalls, even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had covered\\r\\nnearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same\\r\\nseven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying\\r\\n36\\r\\nbroomsticks, and waving energetically.\\r\\n\"Your Quidditch team?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"The Chudley Cannons,\" said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread,\\r\\nwhich was emblazoned with two giant black C\\'s and a speeding\\r\\ncannonball. \"Ninth in the league.\"\\r\\nRon\\'s school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a\\r\\npile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin\\r\\nMiggs, the Mad Muggle. Ron\\'s magic wand was lying on top of a fish\\r\\ntank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat,\\r\\nScabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun.\\r\\nHarry stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor\\r\\nand looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he could see\\r\\na gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys\\'\\r\\nhedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was watching him almost\\r\\nnervously, as though waiting for his opinion.\\r\\n\"It\\'s a bit small,\" said Ron quickly. \"Not like that room you had\\r\\nwith the Muggles. And I\\'m right underneath the ghoul in the attic;\\r\\nhe\\'s always banging on the pipes and groaning ......\\r\\nBut Harry, grinning widely, said, \"This is the best house I\\'ve ever\\r\\nbeen in.\"\\r\\nRon\\'s ears went pink. .\\r\\nC H4 A P T E R V O U R\\r\\nAT F L 0 V RR 11 $ H\\r\\nAND BLOTTS\\r\\nife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet\\r\\nDrive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys\\'\\r\\nhouse burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the\\r\\nfirst time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it\\r\\nshouted, \"Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!\" The ghoul in the attic howled\\r\\nand dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and\\r\\nsmall explosions from Fred and George\\'s bedroom were considered\\r\\nperfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron\\'s,\\r\\nhowever, wasn\\'t the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the\\r\\nfact that everybody there seemed to like him.\\r\\n37\\r\\nMrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him\\r\\nto eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit\\r\\nnext to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with\\r\\nquestions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things\\r\\nlike plugs and the postal service worked.\\r\\n42\\r\\n\"Fascinating.\" he would say as Harry talked him through using a\\r\\ntelephone. \"Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of\\r\\ngetting along without magic.\"\\r\\nHarry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he\\r\\nhad arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table.\\r\\nThe moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge\\r\\nbowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to\\r\\nknocking things over whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under\\r\\nthe table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like\\r\\nthe setting sun. Pretending he hadn\\'t noticed this, Harry sat down and\\r\\ntook the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him.\\r\\n\"Letters from school,\" said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron\\r\\nidentical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink.\\r\\n\"Dumbledore already knows you\\'re here, Harry - doesn\\'t miss a trick,\\r\\nthat man. You two\\'ve got them, too,\" he added, as Fred and George\\r\\nambled in, still in their pajamas.\\r\\nFor a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters.\\r\\nHarry\\'s told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King\\'s\\r\\nCross station on September first. There was also a list of the new\\r\\nbooks he\\'d need for the coming year.\\r\\nSECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:\\r\\nThe Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2\\r\\nby Miranda Goshawk\\r\\n38\\r\\nBreak with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart\\r\\nGadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart\\r\\nHolidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart\\r\\n4 \",3\\r\\nTravels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart\\r\\nVoyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart\\r\\nWanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart\\r\\nYear with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart\\r\\nFred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry\\'s.\\r\\n\"You\\'ve been told to get all Lockhart\\'s books, too!\" he said. \"The new\\r\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan - bet it\\'s a\\r\\nwitch.\"\\r\\nAt this point, Fred caught his mother\\'s eye and quickly busied himself\\r\\nwith the marmalade.\\r\\n\"That lot won\\'t come cheap,\" said George, with a quick look at his\\r\\nparents. \"Lockhart\\'s books are really expensive ......\\r\\n\"Well, we\\'ll manage,\" said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked worried. \"I\\r\\nexpect we\\'ll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny\\'s things secondhand.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?\" Harry asked Ginny.\\r\\nShe nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her\\r\\nelbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no one saw this except Harry,\\r\\nbecause just then Ron\\'s elder brother Percy walked in. He was\\r\\nalready dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater\\r\\nvest.\\r\\n\"Morning, all,\" said Percy briskly. \"Lovely day.\"\\r\\nHe sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost\\r\\nimmediately, pulling from underneath him a moulting, gray feather\\r\\nduster - at least, that was what Harry thought it was, until he saw that\\r\\nit was breathing.\\r\\n* 44\\r\\n39\\r\\n\"Errol!\" said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a\\r\\nletter from under its wing. \"Finally - he\\'s got Hermione\\'s answer. I\\r\\nwrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the\\r\\nDursleys.\"\\r\\nHe carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to\\r\\nstand him on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron lay him on\\r\\nthe draining board instead, muttering, \"Pathetic.\" Then he ripped\\r\\nopen Hermione\\'s letter and read it out loud:\\r\\n\"`Dear Ron, and Harry if you\\'re there,\\r\\n\"`I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that\\r\\nyou didn\\'t do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would\\r\\nget Harry into trouble, too. I\\'ve been really worried and if Harry is all\\r\\nright, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be bet\\r\\nter if you used a different owl because I think another delivery might\\r\\nfinish your one off.\\r\\n\"\\'I\\'m very busy with schoolwork, of course\\'- How can she be?\" said Ron\\r\\nin horror. \"We\\'re on vacation! - \\'and we\\'re going to London next\\r\\nWednesday to buy my new books. Why don\\'t we meet in Diago n Alley?\\r\\n\"`Let me know what\\'s happening as soon as you can. Love from Hermione.\\r\\n\"\\'\\r\\n\"Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,\"\\r\\nsaid Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. \"What\\'re you all up to\\r\\ntoday?\"\\r\\nHarry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a\\r\\nsmall paddock the Weasleys owned. It was surrounded by trees that\\r\\nblocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could\\r\\npractice Quidditch there, as long as they didn\\'t fly too high.\\r\\n* 4$\\r\\nThey couldn\\'t use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to\\r\\nexplain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead\\r\\nthey threw apples for one another to catch. They took turns riding\\r\\nHarry\\'s Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom;\\r\\n40\\r\\nRon\\'s old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies.\\r\\nFive minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over\\r\\ntheir shoulders. They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them, but\\r\\nhe had said he was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so\\r\\nfar; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time.\\r\\n\"Wish I knew what he was up to,\" said Fred, frowning. \"He\\'s not\\r\\nhimself. His exam results came the day before you did; twelve\\r\\nO.WL.s and he hardly gloated at all.\"\\r\\n\"Ordinary Wizarding Levels,\" George explained, seeing Harry\\'s\\r\\npuzzled look. \"Bill got twelve, too. If we\\'re not careful, we\\'ll have\\r\\nanother Head Boy in the family. I don\\'t think I could stand the shame.\"\\r\\nBill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next brother, Charlie,\\r\\nhad already left Hogwarts. Harry had never met either of them, but\\r\\nknew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt\\r\\nworking for the wizard\\'s bank, Gringotts.\\r\\n\"Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this\\r\\nyear,\" said George after a while. \"Five sets of Lockhart books! And\\r\\nGinny needs robes and a wand and everything ......\\r\\nHarry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an underground\\r\\nvault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had\\r\\nleft him. Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he had\\r\\nmoney; you couldn\\'t use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts\\r\\n46\\r\\nin Muggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account\\r\\nto the Dursleys; he didn\\'t think their horror of anything connected with\\r\\nmagic would stretch to a large pile of gold.\\r\\nMrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After a\\r\\nquick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats\\r\\nand Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and\\r\\npeered inside.\\r\\n\"We\\'re running low, Arthur,\" she sighed. \"We\\'ll have to buy some\\r\\nmore today... Ah well, guests first! After you, Harry dear!\"\\r\\n41\\r\\nAnd she offered him the flowerpot.\\r\\nHarry stared at them all watching him.\\r\\n\"W-what am I supposed to do?\" he stammered.\\r\\n\"He\\'s never traveled by Floo powder,\" said Ron suddenly. \"Sorry,\\r\\nHarry, I forgot.\"\\r\\n\"Never?\" said Mr. Weasley. \"But how did you get to Diagon Alley to\\r\\nbuy your school things last year?\"\\r\\n\"I went on the Underground -\"\\r\\n\"Really?\" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \"Were there escapators? How\\r\\nexactly -\"\\r\\n\"Not now, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Floo powder\\'s a lot quicker,\\r\\ndear, but goodness me, if you\\'ve never used it before -\"\\r\\n\"He\\'ll be all right, Mum,\" said Fred. \"Harry, watch us first.\"\\r\\nHe took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up\\r\\nto the fire, and threw the powder into the flames.\\r\\nWith a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred,\\r\\nwho stepped right into it, shouted, \"Diagon Alley!\" and vanished.\\r\\n* 41\\r\\n\"You must speak clearly, dear,\" Mrs. Weasley told Harry as George\\r\\ndipped his hand into the flowerpot. \"And be sure to get out at the right\\r\\ngrate ......\\r\\n\"The right what?\" said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped\\r\\nGeorge out of sight, too.\\r\\n\"Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know,\\r\\nbut as long as you\\'ve spoken clearly -\"\\r\\n\"He\\'ll be fine, Molly, don\\'t fuss,\" said Mr. Weasley, helping himself to\\r\\n42\\r\\nFloo powder, too.\\r\\n\"But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and\\r\\nuncle?\"\\r\\n\"They wouldn\\'t mind,\" Harry reassured her. \"Dudley would think it\\r\\nwas a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don\\'t worry about that -\"\\r\\n\"Well ... all right ... you go after Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Now,\\r\\nwhen you get into the fire, say where you\\'re going\\r\\n\"And keep your elbows tucked in,\" Ron advised.\\r\\n\"And your eyes shut,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"The soot -\"\\r\\n\"Don\\'t fidget,\" said Ron. \"Or you might well fall out of the wrong\\r\\nfireplace -\"\\r\\n\"But don\\'t panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and\\r\\nGeorge.\"\\r\\nTrying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a pinch of Floo powder\\r\\nand walked to the edge of the fire. He took a deep breath, scattered\\r\\nthe powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a\\r\\nwarm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot\\r\\nof hot ash.\\r\\n\"D-Dia-gon Alley,\" he coughed.\\r\\n48\\r\\nIt felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain. He seemed\\r\\nto be spinning very fast - the roaring in his ears was deafening -he\\r\\ntried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him\\r\\nfeel sick - something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in\\r\\ntightly, still spinning and spinning - now it felt as though cold hands\\r\\nwere slapping his face - squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred\\r\\nstream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond - his\\r\\nbacon sandwiches were churning inside him - he closed his eyes again\\r\\nwishing it would stop, and then\\r\\nHe fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses\\r\\n43\\r\\nsnap.\\r\\nDizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding\\r\\nhis broken glasses up to his eyes. He was -,cite alone, but where he\\r\\nwas, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in the\\r\\nstone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard\\'s shop - but\\r\\nnothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list.\\r\\nA glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained\\r\\npack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down\\r\\nfrom the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter,\\r\\nand rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, the\\r\\ndark, narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window\\r\\nwas definitely not Diagon Alley.\\r\\nThe sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it\\r\\nhad hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the\\r\\ndoor, but before he\\'d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on\\r\\nthe other side of the glass - and one of them was the\\r\\n49\\r\\nvery last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in\\r\\nsoot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.\\r\\nHarry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his\\r\\nleft; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack\\r\\nto peer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into\\r\\nthe shop.\\r\\nThe man who followed could only be Draco\\'s father. He had the same\\r\\npale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed\\r\\nthe shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the\\r\\ncounter before turning to his son and saying, \"Touch nothing, Draco.\"\\r\\nMalfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, \"I thought you were\\r\\ngoing to buy me a present.\"\\r\\n\"I said I would buy you a racing broom,\" said his father, drumming his\\r\\nfingers on the counter.\\r\\n\"What\\'s the good of that if I\\'m not on the House team?\" said Malfoy,\\r\\n44\\r\\nlooking sulky and bad-tempered. \"Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two\\r\\nThousand last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so he could\\r\\nplay for Gryffindor. He\\'s not even that good, it\\'s just because he\\'s\\r\\nfamous ... famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead . . . .\"\\r\\nMalfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.\\r\\n\". . . everyone thinks he\\'s so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and\\r\\nhis broomstick -\"\\r\\n\"You have told me this at least a dozen times already,\" said Mr.\\r\\nMalfoy, with a quelling look at his son. \"And I would remind you that it\\r\\nis not - prudent - to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when\\r\\nmost of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord\\r\\ndisappear - ah, Mr. Borgin.\"\\r\\n50\\r\\nA stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his\\r\\ngreasy hair back from his face.\\r\\n\"Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,\" said Mr. Borgin in a\\r\\nvoice as oily as his hair. \"Delighted - and young Master Malfoy, too -\\r\\ncharmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today,\\r\\nand very reasonably priced -\"\\r\\n\"I\\'m not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,\" said Mr. Malfoy.\\r\\n\"Selling?\" The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin\\'s face.\\r\\n\"You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more\\r\\nraids,\" said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside\\r\\npocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. \"I have a few - ah -\\r\\nitems at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call\\r\\n......\\r\\nMr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the\\r\\nlist.\\r\\n\"The Ministry wouldn\\'t presume to trouble you, sir, surely?\"\\r\\nMr. Malfoy\\'s lip curled.\\r\\n45\\r\\n\"I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still commands a\\r\\ncertain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. There\\r\\nare rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act - no doubt that fleabitten,\\r\\nMuggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it\\r\\nHarry felt a hot surge of anger.\\r\\n\"- and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear -\"\\r\\n\"I understand, sir, of course,\" said Mr. Borgin. \"Let me see. . .\"\\r\\n\"Can I have that?\" interrupted Draco, pointing at the withered hand on\\r\\nits cushion.\\r\\n51\\r\\n\"Ah, the Hand of Glory!\" said Mr. Borgin, abandoning Mr. Malfoy\\'s\\r\\nlist and scurrying over to Draco. \"Insert a candle and it gives light only\\r\\nto the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine\\r\\ntaste, sir.\"\\r\\n\"I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer,\\r\\nBorgin,\" said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, \"No\\r\\noffense, sir, no offense meant -\"\\r\\n\"Though if his grades don\\'t pick up,\" said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still,\\r\\n\"that may indeed be all he is fit for -\"\\r\\n\"It\\'s not my fault,\" retorted Draco. \"The teachers all have favorites,\\r\\nthat Hermione Granger -\"\\r\\n\"I would have thought you\\'d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family\\r\\nbeat you in every exam,\" snapped Mr. Malfoy.\\r\\n\"Ha!\" said Harry under his breath, pleased to see Draco looking both\\r\\nabashed and angry.\\r\\n\"It\\'s the same all over,\" said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice. \"Wizard\\r\\nblood is counting for less everywhere -\"\\r\\n\"Not with me,\" said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils flaring.\\r\\n46\\r\\n\"No, sir, nor with me, sir,\" said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow.\\r\\n\"In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,\" said Mr. Malfoy\\r\\nshortly. \"I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important\\r\\nbusiness elsewhere today -\"\\r\\nThey started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as Draco drew\\r\\nnearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale.\\r\\nDraco paused to examine a long coil of hangman\\'s rope and to read,\\r\\nsmirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals,\\r\\nCaution: Do Not Touch. Cursed - Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle\\r\\nOwners to Date.\\r\\n* 52\\r\\nDraco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him. He\\r\\nwalked forward - he stretched out his hand for the handle\\r\\n\"Done,\" said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. \"Come, Draco -\"\\r\\nHarry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away.\\r\\n\"Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. I\\'ll expect you at the manor tomorrow\\r\\nto pick up the goods.\"\\r\\nThe moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily manner.\\r\\n\"Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you\\r\\nhaven\\'t sold me half of what\\'s hidden in your manor ......\\r\\nMuttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back room. Harry\\r\\nwaited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could,\\r\\nslipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\nClutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared around. He had\\r\\nemerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of\\r\\nshops devoted to the Dark Arts. The one he\\'d just left, Borgin and\\r\\nBurkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window\\r\\ndisplay of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was\\r\\nalive with gigantic black spiders. Two shabby-looking wizards were\\r\\n47\\r\\nwatching him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other.\\r\\nFeeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight and\\r\\nhoping against hope he\\'d be able to find a way out of here.\\r\\nAn old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous\\r\\ncandles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn\\'t help, as Harry\\r\\nhad never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn\\'t spoken\\r\\nclearly enough through his mouthful of ashes\\r\\nback in the Weasleys\\' fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what to\\r\\ndo.\\r\\n\"Not lost are you, my dear?\" said a voice in his ear, making him jump.\\r\\nAn aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked\\r\\nhorribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showing\\r\\nmossy teeth. Harry backed away.\\r\\n\"I\\'m fine, thanks,\" he said. \"I\\'m just -\"\\r\\n\"HARRY! What d\\'yeh think yer doin\\' down there?\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded\\r\\ndown over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the\\r\\nHogwarts gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes\\r\\nflashing over his great bristling beard.\\r\\n\"Hagrid!\" Harry croaked in relief. \"I was lost - Floo powder -\"\\r\\nHagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away\\r\\nfrom the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. Her shrieks\\r\\nfollowed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright\\r\\nsunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the\\r\\ndistance - Gringotts Bank. Hagrid had steered him right into Diagon\\r\\nAlley.\\r\\n\"Yer a mess!\" said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off Harry so\\r\\nforcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside\\r\\nan apothecary. \"Skulkin\\' around Knockturn Alley, I dunno dodgy place,\\r\\nHarry - don\\' want no one ter see yeh down there -\"\\r\\n48\\r\\n\"I realized that,\" said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to brush him off\\r\\nagain. \"I told you, I was lost - what were you doing down there,\\r\\nanyway?\"\\r\\n* 54\\r\\n\"I was lookin\\' fer a Flesh-Eatin\\' Slug Repellent,\" growled Hagrid.\\r\\n\"They\\'re ruinin\\' the school cabbages. Yer not on yer own?\"\\r\\n\"I\\'m staying with the Weasleys but we got separated,\" Harry explained.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got to go and find them . . . .\"\\r\\nThey set off together down the street.\\r\\n\"How come yeh never wrote back ter me?\" said Hagrid as Harry\\r\\njogged alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride of\\r\\nHagrid\\'s enormous boots). Harry explained all about Dobby and the\\r\\nDursleys.\\r\\n\"Lousy Muggles,\" growled Hagrid. \"If I\\'d\\'ve known -\"\\r\\n\"Harry! Harry! Over here!\"\\r\\nHarry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the\\r\\nwhite flight of steps to Gringotts. She ran down to meet them, her\\r\\nbushy brown hair flying behind her.\\r\\n\"What happened to your glasses? Hello, Hagrid - Oh, it\\'s wonderful to\\r\\nsee you two again - Are you coming into Gringotts, Harry?\"\\r\\n\"As soon as I\\'ve found the Weasleys,\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Yeh won\\'t have long ter wait,\" Hagrid said with a grin.\\r\\nHarry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street\\r\\nwere Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and Mr. Weasley.\\r\\n\"Harry,\" Mr. Weasley panted. \"We hoped you\\'d only gone one\\r\\ngrate too far . He mopped his glistening bald patch. \"Molly\\'s\\r\\n49\\r\\nfrantic - she\\'s coming now -\"\\r\\n\"Where did you come out?\" Ron asked.\\r\\n\"Knockturn Alley,\" said Hagrid grimly.\\r\\n\"Excellent.\" said Fred and George together.\\r\\n\"We\\'ve never been allowed in,\" said Ron enviously.\\r\\n*55*\\r\\n\"I should ruddy well think not,\" growled Hagrid.\\r\\nMrs. Weasley now came galloping into view, her handbag swing\\r\\ning wildly in one hand, Ginny just clinging onto the other.\\r\\n\"Oh, Harry - oh, my dear - you could have been any\\r\\nwhere -\"\\r\\nGasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her\\r\\nbag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid hadn\\'t managed to\\r\\nbeat away. Mr. Weasley took Harry\\'s glasses, gave them a tap of his\\r\\nwand, and returned them, good as new.\\r\\n\"Well, gotta be off,\" said Hagrid, who was having his hand\\r\\nwrung by Mrs. Weasley (\"Knockturn Alley! If you hadn\\'t found\\r\\nhim, Hagrid!\"). \"See yer at Hogwarts!\" And he strode away, head\\r\\nand shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street.\\r\\n\"Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?\" Harry asked Ron and\\r\\nHermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps. \"Malfoy and his fa\\r\\nther.\"\\r\\n\"Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything?\" said Mr. Weasley sharply\\r\\nbehind them.\\r\\n\"No, he was selling =\\'\\r\\n\"So he\\'s worried,\" said Mr. Weasley with grim satisfaction. \"Oh,\\r\\nI\\'d love to get Lucius Malfoy for something ......\\r\\n\"You be careful, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley sharply as they were\\r\\nbowed into the bank by a goblin at the door. \"That family\\'s trou\\r\\nble. Don\\'t go biting off more than you can chew -\"\\r\\n\"So you don\\'t think I\\'m a match for Lucius Malfoy?\" said Mr.\\r\\nWeasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the\\r\\nsight of Hermione\\'s parents, who were standing nervously at the\\r\\ncounter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for\\r\\nHermione to introduce them.\\r\\n50\\r\\n,5 s\\r\\n\"But you\\'re Muggles!\" said Mr. Weasley delightedly. \"We must have a drink!\\r\\nWhat\\'s that you\\'ve got there? Oh, you\\'re changing Muggle money. Molly,\\r\\nlook!\" He pointed excitedly at the tenpound notes in Mr. Granger\\'s hand.\\r\\n\"Meet you back here,\" Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry\\r\\nwere led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.\\r\\nThe vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that sped\\r\\nalong miniature train tracks through the bank\\'s underground tunnels.\\r\\nHarry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys\\' vault, but felt\\r\\ndreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley, when it was opened.\\r\\nThere was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon.\\r\\nMrs. Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into\\r\\nher bag. Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault. He tried to\\r\\nblock the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a\\r\\nleather bag.\\r\\nBack outside on the marble steps, they all separated. Percy muttered\\r\\nvaguely about needing a new quill. Fred and George had spotted their\\r\\nfriend from Hogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were going to\\r\\na secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers\\r\\noff to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink.\\r\\n\"We\\'ll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks,\"\\r\\nsaid Mrs. Weasley, setting off with Ginny. \"And not one step down\\r\\nKnockturn Alley!\" she shouted at the twins\\' retreating backs.\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled street.\\r\\nThe bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully\\r\\n*57*\\r\\nin Harry\\'s pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three\\r\\nlarge strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped\\r\\nhappily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating\\r\\nshop windows. Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Can\\r\\nnon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until\\r\\nHermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door.\\r\\nIn Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George,\\r\\nand Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster\\'s Fabulous\\r\\n51\\r\\nWet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of bro\\r\\nken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion\\r\\nstains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small and deeply\\r\\nboring book called Prefects Who Gained Power.\\r\\n`A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers, \" Ron read\\r\\naloud off the back cover. \"That sounds fascinating . . . .\"\\r\\n\"Go away,\" Percy snapped.\\r\\n\"\\'Course, he\\'s very ambitious, Percy, he\\'s got it all planned\\r\\nout .... He wants to be Minister of Magic. . . \" Ron told Harry\\r\\nand Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it.\\r\\nAn hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts. They were by\\r\\nno means the only ones making their way to the bookshop. As they\\r\\napproached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling out\\r\\nside the doors, trying to get in. The reason for this was proclaimed\\r\\nby a large banner stretched across the upper windows:\\r\\nGILDEROY LOCKHART\\r\\nwill be signing copies of his autobiography\\r\\nMAGICAL ME\\r\\ntoday 12:30 P.m. to 4:30 P.m.\\r\\n\"We can actually meet him!\" Hermione squealed. \"I mean, he\\'s\\r\\nwritten almost the whole booklist!\"\\r\\nThe crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs.\\r\\nWeasley\\'s age. A harrassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying,\\r\\n\"Calmly, please, ladies .... Don\\'t push, there ... mind the books, now . .\\r\\n. . \"\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside. A long line wound\\r\\nright to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing\\r\\nhis books. They each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells,\\r\\nGrade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys\\r\\nwere standing with Mr. and Mrs. Granger.\\r\\n\"Oh, there you are, good,\" said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded breathless\\r\\nand kept patting her hair. \"We\\'ll be able to see him in a minute ......\\r\\nGilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded\\r\\nby large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly\\r\\n52\\r\\nwhite teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of\\r\\nforget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard\\'s\\r\\nhat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair.\\r\\nA short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs\\r\\nwith a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with\\r\\nevery blinding flash.\\r\\n\"Out of the way, there,\" he snarled at Ron, moving back to get a better\\r\\nshot. \"This is for the Daily Prophet -\"\\r\\n\"Big deal,\" said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had\\r\\nstepped on it.\\r\\nGilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked up. He saw Ron\\r\\n*59*\\r\\nand then he saw Harry. He stared. Then he leapt to his feet and positively\\r\\nshouted, \"It can\\'t be Harry Potter?\"\\r\\nThe crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forward, seized\\r\\nHarry\\'s arm, and pulled him to the front. The crowd burst into applause.\\r\\nHarry\\'s face burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the photographer, who\\r\\nwas clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys.\\r\\n\"Nice big smile, Harry,\" said Lockhart, through his own gleaming teeth.\\r\\n\"Together, you and I are worth the front page.\"\\r\\nWhen he finally let go of Harry\\'s hand, Harry could hardly feel his fingers.\\r\\nHe tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys, but Lockhart threw an arm\\r\\naround his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side.\\r\\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said loudly, waving for quiet. \"What an\\r\\nextraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a little\\r\\nannouncement I\\'ve been sitting on for some time!\\r\\n\"When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he only\\r\\nwanted to buy my autobiography -which I shall be happy to present him\\r\\nnow, free of charge-\" The crowd applauded again. \"He had no idea,\"\\r\\nLockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to\\r\\n53\\r\\nthe end of his nose, \"that he would shortly be getting much, much more\\r\\nthan my book, Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be getting\\r\\nthe real magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and\\r\\npride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of\\r\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft\\r\\nand Wizardry!\"\\r\\nThe crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being\\r\\n60\\r\\npresented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering\\r\\nslightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of the\\r\\nlimelight to the edge of the room, where Ginny was standing next to\\r\\nher new cauldron.\\r\\n\"You have these,\" Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into the\\r\\ncauldron. \"I\\'ll buy my own -\"\\r\\n\"Bet you loved that, didn\\'t you, Potter?\" said a voice Harry had no\\r\\ntrouble recognizing. He straightened up and found himself face-to-face\\r\\nwith Draco Malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer.\\r\\n\"Famous Harry Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"Can\\'t even go into a bookshop\\r\\nwithout making the front page.\"\\r\\n\"Leave him alone, he didn\\'t want all that!\" said Ginny. It was the first\\r\\ntime she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Malfoy.\\r\\n\"Potter, you\\'ve got yourself a girlfriend!\" drawled Malfoy. Ginny went\\r\\nscarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching\\r\\nstacks of Lockhart\\'s books.\\r\\n\"Oh, it\\'s you,\" said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something\\r\\nunpleasant on the sole of his shoe. \"Bet you\\'re surprised to see Harry\\r\\nhere, eh?\"\\r\\n\"Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,\" retorted\\r\\nMalfoy. \"I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for\\r\\nall those.\"\\r\\nRon went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into the cauldron,\\r\\n54\\r\\ntoo, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione grabbed the\\r\\nback of his jacket.\\r\\n\"Ron!\" said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Fred and George.\\r\\n\"What are you doing? It\\'s too crowded in here, let\\'s go outside.\"\\r\\n61\\r\\n\"Well, well, well - Arthur Weasley.\"\\r\\nIt was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco\\'s shoulder,\\r\\nsneering in just the same way.\\r\\n\"Lucius,\" said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly.\\r\\n\"Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,\" said Mr. Malfoy. \"All those raids\\r\\n... I hope they\\'re paying you overtime?\"\\r\\nHe reached into Ginny\\'s cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossy\\r\\nLockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner\\'s Guide\\r\\nto Transfiguration.\\r\\n\"Obviously not,\" Mr. Malfoy said. \"Dear me, what\\'s the use of being a\\r\\ndisgrace to the name of wizard if they don\\'t even pay you well for it?\"\\r\\nMr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny.\\r\\n\"We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard,\\r\\nMalfoy,\" he said.\\r\\n\"Clearly,\" said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGranger, who were watching apprehensively. \"The company you\\r\\nkeep, Weasley ... and I thought your family could sink no lower =\\'\\r\\nThere was a thud of metal as Ginny\\'s cauldron went flying; Mr.\\r\\nWeasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backward\\r\\ninto a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down\\r\\non all their heads; there was a yell of, \"Get him, Dad!\" from Fred or\\r\\nGeorge; Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, \"No, Arthur, no!\"; the crowd\\r\\nstampeded backward, knocking more shelves over; \"Gentlemen,\\r\\nplease - please!\" cried the assistant, and then, louder than all\\r\\n55\\r\\n\"Break it up, there, gents, break it up -\"\\r\\n62\\r\\nHagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books. In an instant he had\\r\\npulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart. Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr.\\r\\nMalfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools. He was still\\r\\nholding Ginny\\'s old Transfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyes\\r\\nglittering with malice.\\r\\n\"Here, girl - take your book - it\\'s the best your father can give you -\" Pulling\\r\\nhimself out of Hagrid\\'s grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop.\\r\\n\"Yeh should\\'ve ignored him, Arthur,\" said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr. Weasley\\r\\noff his feet as he straightened his robes. \"Rotten ter the core, the whole family,\\r\\neveryone knows that - no Malfoy\\'s worth listenin\\' ter - bad blood, that\\'s what it\\r\\nis - come on now - let\\'s get outta here.\"\\r\\nThe assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely\\r\\ncame up to Hagrid\\'s waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried up the\\r\\nstreet, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs. Weasley beside herself with\\r\\nfury.\\r\\n\"A fine example to set for your children . . . brawling in public . . . what\\r\\nGilderoy Lockhart must\\'ve thought -\"\\r\\n\"He was pleased,\" said Fred. \"Didn\\'t you hear him as we were leaving? He was\\r\\nasking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he\\'d be able to work the fight into\\r\\nhis report - said it was all publicity -\"\\r\\nBut it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the Leaky\\r\\nCauldron, where Harry, the Weasleys, and all their shopping would be\\r\\ntraveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder. They said good-bye to the\\r\\nGrangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side;\\r\\nMr. Weasley started to ask\\r\\n63\\r\\nthem how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs.\\r\\nWeasley\\'s face.\\r\\nHarry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before\\r\\n56\\r\\nhelping himself to Floo powder. It definitely wasn\\'t his favorite way to\\r\\ntravel.\\r\\nC H-H A P T E RR F I v E\\r\\nTHE WHOMPING\\r\\nWILLOW\\r\\nhe end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry\\'s liking.\\r\\nHe was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month\\r\\nat the Burrow had been the happiest of his life. It was difficult not to\\r\\nfeel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of\\r\\nwelcome he could expect next time he turned up on Privet Drive.\\r\\nOn their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner\\r\\nthat included all of Harry\\'s favorite things, ending with a\\r\\nmouthwatering treacle pudding. Fred and George rounded off the\\r\\nevening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they fiIled the kitchen\\r\\nwith red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least\\r\\nhalf an hour. Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and\\r\\nbed.\\r\\nIt took a long while to get started next morning. They were up at\\r\\ndawn, but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do.\\r\\n65\\r\\nMrs. Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and\\r\\nquills; people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of toast\\r\\nin their hands; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke his neck, tripping over a\\r\\nstray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying Ginny\\'s trunk to the car.\\r\\nHarry couldn\\'t see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a\\r\\nrat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia. He had reckoned, of\\r\\ncourse, without the special features that Mr. Weasley had added.\\r\\n\"Not a word to Molly,\" he whispered to Harry as he opened the. trunk\\r\\nand showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the\\r\\nluggage fitted easily.\\r\\n57\\r\\nWhen at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into the\\r\\nback seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting\\r\\ncomfortably side by side, and said, \"Muggles do know more than we\\r\\ngive them credit for, don\\'t they?\" She and Ginny got into the front seat,\\r\\nwhich had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench. \"I mean,\\r\\nyou\\'d never know it was this roomy from the outside, would you?\"\\r\\nMr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard,\\r\\nHarry turning back for a last look at the house. He barely had time to\\r\\nwonder when he\\'d see it again when they were back George had\\r\\nforgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes after that, they\\r\\nskidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run in for his\\r\\nbroomstick. They had almost reached the highway when Ginny\\r\\nshrieked that she\\'d left her diary. By the time she had clambered back\\r\\ninto the car, they were running very late, and tempers were running\\r\\nhigh.\\r\\n* 66\\r\\nMr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife.\\r\\n\"Molly, dear -\"\\r\\n\"No, Arthur -\"\\r\\n\"No one would see - this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I\\r\\ninstalled - that\\'d get us up in the air - then we fly above the clouds.\\r\\nWe\\'d be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser -\"\\r\\n\"I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight -\"\\r\\nThey reached King\\'s Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr. Weasley\\r\\ndashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all\\r\\nhurried into the station.\\r\\nHarry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The tricky\\r\\npart was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn\\'t\\r\\nvisible to the Muggle eye. What you had to do was walk through the\\r\\nsolid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. It didn\\'t hurt, but it had to\\r\\nbe done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing.\\r\\n\"Percy first,\" said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at the clock\\r\\n58\\r\\noverhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappear\\r\\ncasually through the barrier.\\r\\nPercy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr. Weasley went next;\\r\\nFred and George followed.\\r\\n\"I\\'ll take Ginny and you two come right after us,\" Mrs. Weasley told\\r\\nHarry and Ron, grabbing Ginny\\'s hand and setting off. In the blink of\\r\\nan eye they were gone.\\r\\n\"Let\\'s go together, we\\'ve only got a minute,\" Ron said to Harry.\\r\\nHarry made sure that Hedwig\\'s cage was safely wedged on top of his\\r\\ntrunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier. He felt\\r\\n61\\r\\nperfectly confident; this wasn\\'t nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo\\r\\npowder. Both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and\\r\\nwalked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed. A few feet\\r\\naway from it, they broke into a run and\\r\\nCRASH.\\r\\nBoth trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron\\'s trunk fell\\r\\noff with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig\\'s\\r\\ncage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking\\r\\nindignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled,\\r\\n\"What in blazes d\\'you think you\\'re doing?\"\\r\\n\"Lost control of the trolley,\" Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he\\r\\ngot up. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scene\\r\\nthat there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the\\r\\nsurrounding crowd.\\r\\n\"Why can\\'t we get through?\" Harry hissed to Ron.\\r\\n\"I dunno -\"\\r\\nRon looked wildly around. A dozen curious people were still\\r\\nwatching them.\\r\\n59\\r\\n\"We\\'re going to miss the train,\" Ron whispered. \"I don\\'t understand\\r\\nwhy the gateway\\'s sealed itself -\"\\r\\nHarry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit\\r\\nof his stomach. Ten seconds ... nine seconds ...\\r\\nHe wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the\\r\\nbarrier and pushed with all his might. The metal remained solid.\\r\\nThree seconds . . . two seconds ... one second ...\\r\\n\"It\\'s gone,\" said Ron, sounding stunned. \"The train\\'s left. What if\\r\\nMum and Dad can\\'t get back through to us? Have you got any\\r\\nMuggle money?\"\\r\\n68\\r\\nAnd they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of\\r\\nthe station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was\\r\\nparked.\\r\\nRon unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand.\\r\\nThey heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and\\r\\ngot into the front.\\r\\n\"Check that no one\\'s watching,\" said Ron, starting the ignition with\\r\\nanother tap of his wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window:\\r\\nTraffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was\\r\\nempty.\\r\\n\"Okay,\" he said.\\r\\nRon pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around\\r\\nthem vanished - and so did they. Harry could feel the seat vibrating\\r\\nbeneath him, hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his\\r\\nglasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had become a pair of\\r\\neyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of\\r\\nparked cars.\\r\\n\"Let\\'s go,\" said Ron\\'s voice from his right.\\r\\nAnd the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away,\\r\\n60\\r\\ndropping out of sight as the car rose; in seconds, the whole of London\\r\\nlay, smoky and glittering, below them.\\r\\nThen there was a popping noise and the car, Harry, and Ron\\r\\nreappeared.\\r\\n\"Uh-oh,\" said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. \"It\\'s faulty -\"\\r\\nBoth of them pummeled it. The car vanished. Then it flickered back\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\"Hold on!\" Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the acceler\\r\\n* 7 0\\r\\nator; they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everything\\r\\nturned dull and foggy.\\r\\n\"Now what?\" said Harry, blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing\\r\\nin on them from all sides.\\r\\n\"We need to see the train to know what direction to go in,\" said Ron.\\r\\n\"Dip back down again - quickly -\"\\r\\nThey dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their\\r\\nseats, squinting at the ground.\\r\\n\"I can see it!\" Harry yelled. \"Right ahead - there!\"\\r\\nThe Hogwarts Express was streaking along below them like a scarlet\\r\\nsnake.\\r\\n\"Due north,\" said Ron, checking the compass on the dashboard.\\r\\n\"Okay, we\\'ll just have to check on it every half hour or so - hold on\\r\\nAnd they shot up through the clouds. A minute later, they burst out\\r\\ninto a blaze of sunlight.\\r\\nIt was a different world. The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of\\r\\nfluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun.\\r\\n61\\r\\n\"All we\\'ve got to worry about now are airplanes,\" said Ron.\\r\\nThey looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, they\\r\\ncouldn\\'t stop.\\r\\nIt was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream. This,\\r\\nthought Harry, was surely the only way to travel - past swirls and\\r\\nturrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat\\r\\npack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeing\\r\\nFred\\'s and George\\'s jealous faces when they\\r\\n* 71\\r\\nlanded smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of\\r\\nHogwarts castle.\\r\\nThey made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and\\r\\nfarther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different\\r\\nview. London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat green\\r\\nfields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive\\r\\nwith cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches.\\r\\nSeveral uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit that\\r\\nsome of the fun was wearing off. The toffees had made them\\r\\nextremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink. He and Ron had\\r\\npulled off their sweaters, but Harry\\'s T-shirt was sticking to the back\\r\\nof his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty\\r\\nnose. He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and\\r\\nwas thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could buy\\r\\nice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch. Why\\r\\nhadn\\'t they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters?\\r\\n\"Can\\'t be much further, can it?\" croaked Ron, hours later still, as the\\r\\nsun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink.\\r\\n\"Ready for another check on the train?\"\\r\\nIt was still right below them, winding its way past a snowcapped\\r\\nmountain. It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds.\\r\\nRon put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again,\\r\\nbut as he did so, the engine began to whine.\\r\\n62\\r\\nHarry and Ron exchanged nervous glances.\\r\\n\"It\\'s probably just tired,\" said Ron. \"It\\'s never been this far before\\r\\n......\\r\\n12\\r\\nAnd they both pretended not to notice the whining growing\\r\\nlouder and louder as the sky became steadily darker. Stars were\\r\\nblossoming in the blackness. Harry pulled his sweater back on, try\\r\\ning to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving fee\\r\\nbly, as though in protest.\\r\\n\"Not far,\" said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, \"not far\\r\\nnow,\" and he patted the dashboard nervously.\\r\\nWhen they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, they\\r\\nhad to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew.\\r\\n\"There!\" Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig jump.\\r\\n\"Straight ahead!\"\\r\\nSilhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake,\\r\\nstood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle.\\r\\nBut the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed.\\r\\n\"Come on,\" Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a lit\\r\\ntle shake, \"nearly there, come on -\"\\r\\nThe engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were issuing from un\\r\\nder the hood. Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat\\r\\nvery hard as they flew toward the lake.\\r\\nThe car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his window, Harry\\r\\nsaw the smooth, black, glassy surface of the water, a mile below.\\r\\nRon\\'s knuckles were white on the steering wheel. The car wobbled\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\"Come on,\" Ron muttered.\\r\\nThey were over the lake - the castle was right ahead - Ron\\r\\nput his foot down.\\r\\nThere was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died com\\r\\npletely.\\r\\n\"Uh-oh,\" said Ron, into the silence.\\r\\nThe nose of the car dropped. They were falling, gathering speed,\\r\\nheading straight for the solid castle wall.\\r\\n\"Noooooo!\" Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they\\r\\n63\\r\\nmissed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc,\\r\\nsoaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then\\r\\nout over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time.\\r\\nRon let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of\\r\\nhis back pocket\\r\\n\"STOP! STOP!\" he yelled, whacking the dashboard and the\\r\\nwindshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up toward\\r\\nthem\\r\\n\"WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!\" Harry bellowed, lunging for the\\r\\nsteering wheel, but too late\\r\\nCRUNCH.\\r\\nWith an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick tree\\r\\ntrunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt. Steam was\\r\\nbillowing from under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in\\r\\nterror; a golfball-size lump was throbbing on Harry\\'s head where he\\r\\nhad hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron let out a low, despairing\\r\\ngroan.\\r\\n\"Are you okay?\" Harry said urgently.\\r\\n\"My wand,\" said Ron, in a shaky voice. \"Look at my wand -\"\\r\\nIt had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by a\\r\\nfew splinters.\\r\\nHarry opened his mouth to say he was sure they\\'d be able to mend it\\r\\nup at the school, but he never even got started. At that very moment,\\r\\nsomething hit his side of the car with the force of a\\r\\n* Y4 *\\r\\ncharging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an\\r\\nequally heavy blow hit the roof.\\r\\n\"What\\'s happen -?\"\\r\\nRon gasped, staring through the windshield, and Harry looked around\\r\\n64\\r\\njust in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it. The tree\\r\\nthey had hit was attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost double, and\\r\\nits gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could\\r\\nreach.\\r\\n\"Aaargh!\" said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into\\r\\nhis door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from\\r\\nknuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was\\r\\npounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving\\r\\n\"Run for it!\" Ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door, but\\r\\nnext second he had been knocked backward into Harry\\'s lap by a\\r\\nvicious uppercut from another branch.\\r\\n\"We\\'re done for!\" he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the\\r\\nfloor of the car was vibrating - the engine had restarted.\\r\\n\"Reverse!\" Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still\\r\\ntrying to hit them; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped\\r\\nitself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach.\\r\\n\"That,\" panted Ron, \"was close. Well done, car -\"\\r\\nThe car, however, had reached the end of its tether. With two sharp\\r\\nclunks, the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways: Next\\r\\nthing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground. Loud thuds told\\r\\nhim that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk; Hedwig\\'s\\r\\ncage flew through the air and burst open; she rose out of it with an\\r\\nangry screech and sped off toward the castle\\r\\nY5\\r\\nwithout a backward look. Then, dented, scratched, and steaming,\\r\\nthe car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily.\\r\\n\"Come back!\" Ron yelled after it, brandishing his broken wand.\\r\\n\"Dad\\'ll kill me!\"\\r\\nBut the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its\\r\\nexhaust.\\r\\n\"Can you believe our luck?\" said Ron miserably, bending down to\\r\\n65\\r\\npick up Scabbers. \"Of all the trees we could\\'ve hit, we had to get\\r\\none that hits back.\"\\r\\nHe glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still\\r\\nflailing its branches threateningly.\\r\\n\"Come on,\" said Harry wearily, \"we\\'d better get up to the school\\r\\n......\\r\\nIt wasn\\'t at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured. Stiff, cold,\\r\\nand bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging\\r\\nthem up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors.\\r\\n\"I think the feast\\'s already started,\" said Ron, dropping his trunk at\\r\\nthe foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a\\r\\nbrightly lit window. \"Hey - Harry - come and look - it\\'s the Sorting!\"\\r\\nHarry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the Great\\r\\nHall.\\r\\nInnumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long,\\r\\ncrowded tables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle.\\r\\nOverhead, the bewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the sky\\r\\noutside, sparkled with stars.\\r\\nThrough the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, Harry saw a long\\r\\nline of scared-looking first years fiIing into the Hall. Ginny\\r\\n* 76\\r\\nwas among them, easily visible because of her vivid Weasley ha-ir.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair\\r\\nin a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a\\r\\nstool before the newcomers.\\r\\nEvery year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new\\r\\nstudents into the four Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff,\\r\\nRavenclaw, and Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on,\\r\\nexactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it\\r\\nmuttered aloud in his ear. For a few horrible seconds he had feared\\r\\nthat the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the house that had\\r\\nturned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other -but he had\\r\\n66\\r\\nended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the\\r\\nWeasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the\\r\\nHouse Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven\\r\\nyears.\\r\\nA very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the\\r\\nhat on his head. Harry\\'s eyes wandered past him to where Professor\\r\\nDumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff\\r\\ntable, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the\\r\\ncandlelight. Several seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart,\\r\\ndressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was Hagrid,\\r\\nhuge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet.\\r\\n\"Hang on. . . \" Harry muttered to Ron. \"There\\'s an empty chair at the\\r\\nstaff table .... Where\\'s Snape?\"\\r\\nProfessor Severus Snape was Harry\\'s least favorite teacher. Harry\\r\\nalso happened to be Snape\\'s least favorite student. Cruel, sarcastic,\\r\\nand disliked by everybody except the students from his own house\\r\\n(Slytherin), Snape taught Potions.\\r\\n\"Maybe he\\'s ill!\" said Ron hopefully.\\r\\n\"Maybe he\\'s left,\" said Ha-rry, \"because he missed out on the Defense\\r\\nAgainst Dark Arts job again!\"\\r\\n\"Or he might have been sacked!\" said Ron enthusiastically. \"I mean,\\r\\neveryone hates him -\"\\r\\n\"Or maybe,\" said a very cold voice right behind them, \"he\\'s waiting to\\r\\nhear why you two didn\\'t arrive on the school train.\"\\r\\nHarry spun around. There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze,\\r\\nstood Severus Snape. He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked\\r\\nnose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he\\r\\nwas smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep\\r\\ntrouble.\\r\\n\"Follow me,\" said Snape.\\r\\nNot daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron followed Snape\\r\\nup the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with\\r\\n67\\r\\nflaming torches. A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great\\r\\nHall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and light, down a\\r\\nnarrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons.\\r\\n\"In!\" he said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and\\r\\npointing.\\r\\nThey entered Snape\\'s office, shivering. The shadowy walls were lined\\r\\nwith shelves of large glass) ars, in which floated all manner of\\r\\nrevolting things Harry didn\\'t really want to know the name of at the\\r\\nmoment. The fireplace was dark and empty. Snape closed the door\\r\\nand turned to look at them.\\r\\n\"So,\" he said softly, \"the train isn\\'t good enough for the famous Harry\\r\\nPotter and his faithful sidekick Weasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang,\\r\\ndid we, boys?\"\\r\\n\"No, sir, it was the barrier at King\\'s Cross, it -\"\\r\\n78\\r\\n\"Silence!\" said Snape coldly. \"What have you done with the\\r\\ncar?\"\\r\\nRon gulped. This wasn\\'t the first time Snape had given Harry the\\r\\nimpression of being able to read minds. But a moment later, he un\\r\\nderstood, as Snape unrolled today\\'s issue of the Evening Prophet.\\r\\n\"You were seen,\" he hissed, showing them the headline: FLY\\r\\nING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. He began to read\\r\\naloud: \"Two Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old car\\r\\nflying over the Post Office tower ... at noon in Norfolk, Mrs.\\r\\nHetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing ... Mr. Angus Fleet,\\r\\nof Peebles, reported to police ... Six or seven Muggles in all. I be\\r\\nlieve your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?\"\\r\\nhe said, looking up at Ron and smiling still more nastily. \"Dear,\\r\\ndear ... his own son. . . \"\\r\\nHarry felt as though he\\'d just been walloped in the stomach by\\r\\none of the mad tree\\'s larger branches. If anyone found out Mr.\\r\\nWeasley had bewitched the car ... he hadn\\'t thought of that ....\\r\\n\"I noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable damage\\r\\nseems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow,\"\\r\\nSnape went on.\\r\\n\"That tree did more damage to us than we -\" Ron blurted out.\\r\\n68\\r\\n\"Silence!\" snapped Snape again. \"Most unfortunately, you are\\r\\nnot in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with\\r\\nme. I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power.\\r\\nYou will wait here.\"\\r\\nHarry and Ron stared at each other, white-faced. Harry didn\\'t\\r\\nfeel hungry any more. He now felt extremely sick. He tried not to\\r\\nlook at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a\\r\\nshelf behind Snape\\'s desk. If Snape had gone to fetch Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, they were hardly any better\\r\\noff. She might be fairer than Snape, but she was still extremely strict.\\r\\nTen minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall who accompanied him. Harry had seen Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall angry on several occasions, but either he had forgotten\\r\\njust how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen her this angry\\r\\nbefore. She raised her wand the moment she entered; Harry and Ron\\r\\nboth flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where\\r\\nflames suddenly erupted.\\r\\n\"Sit,\" she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire.\\r\\n\"Explain,\" she said, her glasses glinting ominously.\\r\\nRon launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the station\\r\\nrefusing to let them through.\\r\\n\"\\r\\n-so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn\\'t get on the train.\"\\r\\n\"Why didn\\'t you send us a letter by owl? I believe you have an owl?\"\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall said coldly to Harry.\\r\\nHarry gaped at her. Now she said it, that seemed the obvious thing to\\r\\nhave done.\\r\\n\"I - I didn\\'t think -\"\\r\\n\"That,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"is obvious.\"\\r\\nThere was a knock on the office door and Snape, now looking happier\\r\\n69\\r\\nthan ever, opened it. There stood the headmaster, Professor\\r\\nDumbledore.\\r\\nHarry\\'s whole body went numb. Dumbledore was looking unusually\\r\\ngrave. He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and\\r\\n*80*\\r\\nHarry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still being\\r\\nbeaten up by the Whomping Willow.\\r\\nThere was a long silence. Then Dumbledore said, \"Please explain why\\r\\nyou did this.\"\\r\\nIt would have been better if he had shouted. Harry hated the\\r\\ndisappointment in his voice. For some reason, he was unable to look\\r\\nDumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees. He told\\r\\nDumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley owned the\\r\\nbewitched car, making it sound as though he and Ron had happened to\\r\\nfind a flying car parked outside the station. He knew Dumbledore\\r\\nwould see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no questions\\r\\nabout the car. When Harry had finished, he merely continued to peer\\r\\nat them through his spectacles.\\r\\n\"We\\'ll go and get our stuff,\" said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice.\\r\\n\"What are you talking about, Weasley?\" barked Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall.\\r\\n\"Well, you\\'re expelling us, aren\\'t you?\" said Ron.\\r\\nHarry looked quickly at Dumbledore.\\r\\n\"Not today, Mr. Weasley,\" said Dumbledore. \"But I must impress upon\\r\\nboth of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to\\r\\nboth your families tonight. I must also warn you that if you do anything\\r\\nlike this again, I will have no choice but to expel you.\"\\r\\nSnape looked as though Christmas had been canceled. He cleared his\\r\\nthroat and said, \"Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the\\r\\nDecree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious\\r\\ndamage to an old and valuable tree - surely acts of this nature -\"\\r\\n70\\r\\n* 8i\\r\\n\"It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys\\'\\r\\npunishments, Severus,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"They are in her\\r\\nHouse and are therefore her responsibility.\" He turned to Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall. \"I must go back to the feast, Minerva, I\\'ve got to give\\r\\nout a few notices. Come, Severus, there\\'s a delicious-looking cus\\r\\ntard tart I want to sample -\"\\r\\nSnape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as he allowed\\r\\nhimself to be swept out of his office, leaving them alone with Pro\\r\\nfessor McGonagall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle.\\r\\n\"You\\'d better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you\\'re\\r\\nbleeding.\"\\r\\n\"Not much,\" said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye with\\r\\nhis sleeve. \"Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted -\"\\r\\n\"The Sorting Ceremony is over,\" said Professor McGonagall.\\r\\n\"Your sister is also in Gryffindor.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, good,\" said Ron.\\r\\n\"And speaking of Gryffindor -\" Professor McGonagall said\\r\\nsharply, but Harry cut in: \"Professor, when we took the car, term\\r\\nhadn\\'t started, so - so Gryffindor shouldn\\'t really have points\\r\\ntaken from it - should it?\" he finished, watching her anxiously.\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall gave him a piercing look, but he was sure\\r\\nshe had almost smiled. Her mouth looked less thin, anyway.\\r\\n\"I will not take any points from Gryffindor,\" she said, and\\r\\nHarry\\'s heart lightened considerably. \"But you will both get a de\\r\\ntention.\"\\r\\nIt was better than Harry had expected. As for Dumbledore\\'s\\r\\nwriting to the Dursleys, that was nothing. Harry knew perfectly\\r\\nwell they\\'d just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn\\'t\\r\\nsquashed him flat.\\r\\n82\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape\\'s\\r\\ndesk. A large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of-iced\\r\\npumpkin juice appeared with a pop.\\r\\n\"You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory,\" she\\r\\nsaid. \"I must also return to the feast.\"\\r\\n71\\r\\nWhen the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a long, low whistle.\\r\\n\"I thought we\\'d had it,\" he said, grabbing a sandwich.\\r\\n\"So did I,\" said Harry, taking one, too.\\r\\n\"Can you believe our luck, though?\" said Ron thickly through a\\r\\nmouthful of chicken and ham. \"Fred and George must\\'ve flown that\\r\\ncar five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them.\" He swallowed\\r\\nand took another huge bite. \"Why couldn\\'t we get through the barrier?\"\\r\\nHarry shrugged. \"We\\'ll have to watch our step from now on, though,\"\\r\\nhe said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice. \"Wish we could\\'ve\\r\\ngone up to the feast ......\\r\\n\"She didn\\'t want us showing off,\" said Ron sagely. \"Doesn\\'t want\\r\\npeople to think it\\'s clever, arriving by flying car.\"\\r\\nWhen they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could (the plate\\r\\nkept refilling itself) they rose and left the office, treading the familiar\\r\\npath to Gryffindor Tower. The castle was quiet; it seemed that the\\r\\nfeast was over. They walked past muttering portraits and creaking\\r\\nsuits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at last\\r\\nthey reached the passage where the secret entrance to Gryffindor\\r\\nTower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a\\r\\npink silk dress.\\r\\n\"Password?\" she said as they approached.\\r\\n\"Er -\" said Harry.\\r\\nThey didn\\'t know the new year\\'s password, not having met a\\r\\nGryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost immediately; they heard\\r\\nhurrying feet behind them and turned to see Hermione dashing toward\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\"There you are! Where have you been? The most ridiculous rumors -\\r\\nsomeone said you\\'d been expelled for crashing a flying car\\r\\n\"Well, we haven\\'t been expelled,\" Harry assured her.\\r\\n\"You\\'re not telling me you did fly here?\" said Hermione, sounding\\r\\n72\\r\\nalmost as severe as Professor McGonagall.\\r\\n\"Skip the lecture,\" said Ron impatiently, \"and tell us the new\\r\\npassword.\"\\r\\n\"It\\'s `wattlebird,\"\\' said Hermione impatiently, \"but that\\'s not the point -\\r\\n\"\\r\\nHer words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady\\r\\nswung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. It looked as\\r\\nthough the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into\\r\\nthe circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and\\r\\nsquashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive. Arms reached through\\r\\nthe portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to\\r\\nscramble in after then-t.\\r\\n\"Brilliant!\" yelled Lee Jordan. \"Inspired! What an entrance! Flying a\\r\\ncar right into the Whomping Willow, people\\'ll be talking about that\\r\\none for years -\"\\r\\n\"Good for you,\" said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone\\r\\nwas patting him on the back as though he\\'d just won a marathon;\\r\\nFred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said\\r\\ntogether, \"Why couldn\\'t we\\'ve come in the car, eh?\"\\r\\n84\\r\\nRon was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could\\r\\nsee one person who didn\\'t look happy at all. Percy was visible over\\r\\nthe heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying to\\r\\nget near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged Ron in the\\r\\nribs and nodded in Percy\\'s direction. Ron got the point at once.\\r\\n\"Got to get upstairs - bit tired,\" he said, and the two of them started\\r\\npushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room,\\r\\nwhich led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories.\\r\\n\"\\'Night,\" Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl\\r\\njust like Percy\\'s.\\r\\nThey managed to get to the other side of the common room, still\\r\\nhaving their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase.\\r\\n73\\r\\nThey hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of\\r\\ntheir old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS.\\r\\nThey entered the familiar, circular room, with its five four-posters\\r\\nhung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows. Their trunks had\\r\\nbeen brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds.\\r\\nRon grinned guiltily at Harry.\\r\\n\"I know I shouldn\\'t\\'ve enjoyed that or anything, but =\\'\\r\\nThe dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year\\r\\nGryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville\\r\\nLongbottom.\\r\\n\"Unbelievable!\" beamed Seamus.\\r\\n\"Cool,\" said Dean.\\r\\n\"Amazing,\" said Neville, awestruck.\\r\\nHarry couldn\\'t help it. He grinned, too.\\r\\n* 85 *\\r\\nH-H A P T E RR s 1 x\\r\\nGILDEROY LOCKHART\\r\\nhe next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to go\\r\\ndownhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long house tables\\r\\nwere laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of\\r\\ntoast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling\\r\\n(today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor\\r\\ntable next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires\\r\\npropped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the\\r\\nway she said \"Morning,\" which told Harry that she was still\\r\\ndisapproving of the way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the\\r\\nother hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a round-faced and\\r\\naccident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever\\r\\nmet.\\r\\n\"Mail\\'s due any minute - I think Gran\\'s sending a few things I forgot.\"\\r\\n74\\r\\nHarry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was\\r\\na rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls\\r\\n86\\r\\nstreamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the\\r\\nchattering crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville\\'s head\\r\\nand, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione\\'s jug,\\r\\nspraying them all with milk and feathers.\\r\\n\"Enrol!\" said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errol\\r\\nslumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red\\r\\nenvelope in his beak.\\r\\n\"Oh, no -\" Ron gasped.\\r\\n\"It\\'s all right, he\\'s still alive,\" said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with\\r\\nthe tip of her finger.\\r\\n\"It\\'s not that - it\\'s that.\"\\r\\nRon was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to\\r\\nHarry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they\\r\\nexpected it to explode.\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"She\\'s - she\\'s sent me a Howler,\" said Ron faintly.\\r\\n\"You\\'d better open it, Ron,\" said Neville in a timid whisper. \"It\\'ll be\\r\\nworse if you don\\'t My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and\" -\\r\\nhe gulped - \"it was horrible.\"\\r\\nHarry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope.\\r\\n\"What\\'s a Howler?\" he said.\\r\\nBut Ron\\'s whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to\\r\\nsmoke at the corners.\\r\\n75\\r\\n\"Open it,\" Neville urged. \"It\\'ll all be over in a few minutes -\"\\r\\nRon stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol\\'s\\r\\nbeak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears. A split\\r\\nsecond later, Harry knew why. He thought for a moment it had\\r\\nexploded; a roar of sound fiIled the huge hall, shaking dust from the\\r\\nceiling.\\r\\n8 _\\r\\n\"- E CAR, I WO ULDN\\'T HAVE BEEN S URSTEALING\\r\\nTHE\\r\\nPRISED IF THEY\\'D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET\\r\\nHOLD OF YOU, I DON\\'T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO\\r\\nTHINK WHAT YOUR FATHERAND I WENT THROUGH WHEN\\r\\nWE SAW IT WAS GONE -\"\\r\\nMrs. Weasleys yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the\\r\\nplates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the\\r\\nstone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see\\r\\nwho had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that\\r\\nonly his crimson forehead could be seen.\\r\\n\"- LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT\\r\\nYOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN\\'T BRING\\r\\nYOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD\\r\\nBOTH HAVE DIED -\"\\r\\nHarry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up. He\\r\\ntried very hard to look as though he couldn\\'t hear the voice that was\\r\\nmaking his eardrums throb.\\r\\n\"-ABSOLUTELYDISGUSTED - YOUR FATHER\\'S FACING AN\\r\\nINQUIRY AT WORK, IT\\'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF\\r\\nYOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE\\'LL BRING YOU\\r\\nSTRAIGHT BACK HOME.\"\\r\\nA ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron\\'s\\r\\nhand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat\\r\\n76\\r\\nstunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few\\r\\npeople laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again.\\r\\nHermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top\\r\\nof Ron\\'s head.\\r\\n* 88\\r\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know what you expected, Ron, but you -\"\\r\\n\"Don\\'t tell me I deserved it,\" snapped Ron.\\r\\nHarry pushed his porridge away. His insides were burning with guilt.\\r\\nMr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nWeasley had done for him over the summer ...\\r\\nBut he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was\\r\\nmoving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules.\\r\\nHarry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the\\r\\nHufepuffs first.\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the\\r\\nvegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical\\r\\nplants were kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing:\\r\\nHermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and\\r\\nwas being perfectly friendly again.\\r\\nAs they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class\\r\\nstanding outside, waiting for Professor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and\\r\\nHermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view\\r\\nacross the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. Professor\\r\\nSprout\\'s arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt,\\r\\nHarry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its\\r\\nbranches now in slings.\\r\\nProfessor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over\\r\\nher flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her\\r\\nclothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint.\\r\\nGilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes of\\r\\nturquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise\\r\\nhat with gold trimming.\\r\\n77\\r\\n\"Oh, hello there!\" he called, beaming around at the assembled\\r\\n89\\r\\nstudents. \"Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor\\r\\na Whomping Willow! But I don\\'t want you running away with the idea\\r\\nthat I\\'m better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to have met\\r\\nseveral of these exotic plants on my travels . . .\"\\r\\n\"Greenhouse three today, chaps!\" said Professor Sprout, who was\\r\\nlooking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self.\\r\\nThere was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in\\r\\ngreenhouse one before - greenhouse three housed far more interesting\\r\\nand dangerous plants. Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt\\r\\nand unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and\\r\\nfertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrellasized\\r\\nflowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron\\r\\nand Hermione inside when Lockhart\\'s hand shot out.\\r\\n\"Harry! I\\'ve been wanting a word - you don\\'t mind if he\\'s a couple of\\r\\nminutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?\"\\r\\nJudging by Professor Sprout\\'s scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said,\\r\\n\"That\\'s the ticket,\" and closed the greenhouse door in her face.\\r\\n\"Harry,\" said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight\\r\\nas he shook his head. \"Harry, Harry, Harry.\"\\r\\nCompletely nonplussed, Harry said nothing.\\r\\n\"When I heard -well, of course, it was all my fault. Could have kicked\\r\\nmyself.\"\\r\\nHarry had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to say so\\r\\nwhen Lockhart went on, \"Don\\'t know when I\\'ve been more shocked.\\r\\nFlying a car to Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you\\'d\\r\\ndone it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry.\"\\r\\nIt was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant\\r\\nteeth even when he wasn\\'t talking.\\r\\n78\\r\\n90\\r\\n\"Gave you a taste for publicity, didn\\'t I?\" said Lockhart. \"Gave\\r\\nyou the bug. You got onto the front page of the paper with me and\\r\\nyou couldn\\'t wait to do it again.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, no, Professor, see -\"\\r\\n\"Harry, Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping\\r\\nhis shoulder. \"I understand. Natural to want a bit more once you\\'ve\\r\\nhad that first taste - and I blame myself for giving you that, be\\r\\ncause it was bound to go to your head - but see here, young man,\\r\\nyou can\\'t start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calm\\r\\ndown, all right? Plenty of time for all that when you\\'re older. Yes,\\r\\nyes, I know what you\\'re thinking! \\'It\\'s all right for him, he\\'s an in\\r\\nternationally famous wizard already!\\' But when I was twelve, I was\\r\\njust as much of a nobody as you are now. In fact, Id say I was even\\r\\nmore of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven\\'t\\r\\nthey? All that business with He-\\\\\"o-Must-Not-Be-Named!\" He\\r\\nglanced at the lightning scar on Harry\\'s forehead. \"I know, I\\r\\nknow - it\\'s not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly\\'s Most\\r\\nCharming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have - but it\\'s a\\r\\nstart, Harry, it\\'s a start.\"\\r\\nHe gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood\\r\\nstunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to\\r\\nbe in the greenhouse, he opened the door and slid inside.\\r\\nProfessor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the cen\\r\\nter of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored ear\\r\\nmuffs were lying on the bench. When Harry had taken his place\\r\\nbetween Ron and Hermione, she said, \"We\\'ll be repotting Man\\r\\ndrakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Man\\r\\ndrake?\"\\r\\nTo nobody\\'s surprise, Hermione\\'s hand was first into the air.\\r\\ns1\\r\\n\"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,\" said Hermione,\\r\\nsounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. \"It is\\r\\nused to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their\\r\\noriginal state.\"\\r\\n\"Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,\" said Professor Sprout. \"The\\r\\nMandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. It is also,\\r\\nhowever, dangerous. Who can tell me why?\"\\r\\n79\\r\\nHermione\\'s hand narrowly missed Harry\\'s glasses as it shot up again.\\r\\n\"The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,\" she said\\r\\npromptly.\\r\\n\"Precisely. Take another ten points,\" said Professor Sprout. \"Now, the\\r\\nMandrakes we have here are still very young.\"\\r\\nShe pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone\\r\\nshuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants,\\r\\npurplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite\\r\\nunremarkable to Harry, who didn\\'t have the slightest idea what\\r\\nHermione meant by the \"cry\" of the Mandrake.\\r\\n\"Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,\" said Professor Sprout.\\r\\nThere was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn\\'t\\r\\npink and fluffy.\\r\\n\"When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely\\r\\ncovered,\" said Professor Sprout. \"When it is safe to remove them, I\\r\\nwill give you the thumbs-up. Right - earmuffs on.\"\\r\\nHarry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound\\r\\ncompletely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own\\r\\nears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants\\r\\nfirmly, and pulled hard.\\r\\n*92*\\r\\nHarry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.\\r\\nInstead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out\\r\\nof the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had\\r\\npale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his\\r\\nlungs.\\r\\nProfessor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and\\r\\nplunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until\\r\\nonly the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her\\r\\nhands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs.\\r\\n80\\r\\n\"As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won\\'t kill yet,\" she\\r\\nsaid calmly as though she\\'d just done nothing more exciting than water\\r\\na begonia. \"However, they will knock you out for several hours, and as\\r\\nI\\'m sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your\\r\\nearmuffs are securely in place while you work. I will attract your\\r\\nattention when it is time to pack up.\\r\\n\"Four to a tray - there is a large supply of pots here - compost in the\\r\\nsacks over there - and be careful of the Venemous Tentacula, it\\'s\\r\\nteething.\"\\r\\nShe gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making\\r\\nit draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her\\r\\nshoulder.\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-haired\\r\\nHufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to.\\r\\n\"Justin Finch-Fletchley,\" he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand.\\r\\n\"Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter... And you\\'re\\r\\nHermione Granger - always top in everything\"\\r\\n* 9%\\r\\n(Hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too) \"- and Ron\\r\\nWeasley. Wasn\\'t that your flying car?\"\\r\\nRon didn\\'t smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind.\\r\\n\"That Lockhart\\'s something, isn\\'t he?\" said Justin happily as they\\r\\nbegan fiIling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. \"Awfully\\r\\nbrave chap. Have you read his books? Id have died of fear if Id been\\r\\ncornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and -\\r\\nzap - just fantastic.\\r\\n\"My name was down for Eton, you know. I can\\'t tell you how glad I\\r\\nam I came here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed,\\r\\nbut since I made her read Lockhart\\'s books I think she\\'s begun to see\\r\\nhow useful it\\'ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family . . . .\"\\r\\nAfter that they didn\\'t have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs were\\r\\n81\\r\\nback on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor\\r\\nSprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn\\'t. The Mandrakes\\r\\ndidn\\'t like coming out of the earth, but didn\\'t seem to want to go back\\r\\ninto it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and\\r\\ngnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a\\r\\nparticularly fat one into a pot.\\r\\nBy the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty,\\r\\naching, and covered in earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for\\r\\na quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration.\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall\\'s classes were always hard work, but today\\r\\nwas especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year\\r\\nseemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. He was\\r\\nsupposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed\\r\\n* 94\\r\\nto do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the\\r\\ndesktop avoiding his wand.\\r\\nRon was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand\\r\\nwith some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond\\r\\nrepair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time\\r\\nRon tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke\\r\\nthat smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron\\r\\naccidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a\\r\\nnew one. Professor McGonagall wasn\\'t pleased.\\r\\nHarry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a wrung\\r\\nsponge. Everyone fiIed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who\\r\\nwas whacking his wand furiously on the desk.\\r\\n\"Stupid - useless - thing -\"\\r\\n\"Write home for another one,\" Harry suggested as the wand let off a\\r\\nvolley of bangs like a firecracker.\\r\\n\"Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,\" said Ron, stuffing the now\\r\\nhissing wand into his bag. \" `It\\'s your own fault your wand got snapped -\\r\\n\\'\"\\r\\n82\\r\\nThey went down to lunch, where Ron\\'s mood was not improved by\\r\\nHermione\\'s showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had\\r\\nproduced in Transfiguration.\\r\\n\"What\\'ve we got this afternoon?\" said Harry, hastily changing the\\r\\nsubject.\\r\\n\"Defense Against the Dark Arts,\" said Hermione at once.\\r\\n\"Why, \"demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, \"have you outlined all\\r\\nLockhart\\'s lessons in little hearts?\"\\r\\nHermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously.\\r\\n* 95 *\\r\\nThey finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard.\\r\\nHermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages\\r\\nwith Vampires again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for\\r\\nseveral minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely\\r\\nwatched. Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he\\'d\\r\\nseen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though\\r\\ntransfixed. He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle\\r\\ncamera, and the moment Harry looked at him, he went bright red.\\r\\n\"All right, Harry? I\\'m -I\\'m Colin Creevey,\" he said breathlessly, taking\\r\\na tentative step forward. \"I\\'m in Gryffindor, too. D\\'you think - would it\\r\\nbe all right if - can I have a picture?\" he said, raising the camera\\r\\nhopefully.\\r\\n\"A picture?\" Harry repeated blankly.\\r\\n\"So I can prove I\\'ve met you,\" said Colin Creevey eagerly, edging\\r\\nfurther forward. \"I know all about you. Everyone\\'s told me. About\\r\\nhow you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he\\r\\ndisappeared and everything and how you\\'ve still got a lightning scar on\\r\\nyour forehead\" (his eyes raked Harry\\'s hairline) \"and a boy in my\\r\\ndormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures\\'ll\\r\\nmove.\" Colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said,\\r\\n\"It\\'s amazing here, isn\\'t it? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do\\r\\nwas magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts. My dad\\'s a milkman, he\\r\\ncouldn\\'t believe it either. So I\\'m taking loads of pictures to send home\\r\\n83\\r\\nto him. And it\\'d be really good if I had one of you\" - he looked\\r\\nimploringly at Harry - \"maybe your friend could take it and I could\\r\\nstand next to you? And then, could you sign it?\"\\r\\n96\\r\\n\"Signed photos? You\\'re giving out signed photos, Potter?\"\\r\\nLoud and scathing, Draco Malfoy\\'s voice echoed around the\\r\\ncourtyard. He had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he always\\r\\nwas at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and\\r\\nGoyle.\\r\\n\"Everyone line up!\" Malfoy roared to the crowd. \"Harry Potter\\'s\\r\\ngiving out signed photos!\"\\r\\n\"No, I\\'m not,\" said Harry angrily, his fists clenching. \"Shut up,\\r\\nMalfoy.\"\\r\\n\"You\\'re just jealous,\" piped up Colin, whose entire body was about\\r\\nas thick as Crabbe\\'s neck.\\r\\n`jealous?\"said Malfoy, who didn\\'t need to shout anymore: half the\\r\\ncourtyard was listening in. \"Of what? I don\\'t want a foul scar right\\r\\nacross my head, thanks. I don\\'t think getting your head cut open\\r\\nmakes you that special, myself.\"\\r\\nCrabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly.\\r\\n\"Eat slugs, Malfoy,\" said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped laughing and\\r\\nstarted rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way.\\r\\n\"Be careful, Weasley,\" sneered Malfoy. \"You don\\'t want to start any\\r\\ntrouble or your Mommy\\'ll have to come and take you away from\\r\\nschool.\" He put on a shrill, piercing voice. \"Ifyou put another toe\\r\\nout of line\\' - \"\\r\\nA knot of Slytherin fifth-years nearby laughed loudly at this.\\r\\n\"Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,\" smirked Malfoy. \"It\\'d\\r\\nbe worth more than his family\\'s whole house -\"\\r\\n84\\r\\nRon whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut Voyages\\r\\nwith Vampires with a snap and whispered, \"Look out!\"\\r\\n\"What\\'s all this, what\\'s all this?\" Gilderoy Lockhart was striding\\r\\n* 97\\r\\ntoward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him. \"Who\\'s giv\\r\\ning out signed photos?\"\\r\\nHarry started to speak but he was cut short as Lockhart flung an\\r\\narm around his shoulders and thundered jovially, \"Shouldn\\'t have\\r\\nasked! We meet again, Harry!\"\\r\\nPinned to Lockhart\\'s side and burning with humiliation, Harry\\r\\nsaw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd.\\r\\n\"Come on then, Mr. Creevey,\" said Lockhart, beaming at Colin.\\r\\n\"A double portrait, can\\'t do better than that, and we\\'ll both sign it\\r\\nfor you.\"\\r\\nColin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell\\r\\nrang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes.\\r\\n\"Off you go, move along there,\" Lockhart called to the crowd,\\r\\nand he set off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing he\\r\\nknew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to his side.\\r\\n\"A word to the wise, Harry,\" said Lockhart paternally as they\\r\\nentered the building through a side door. \"I covered up for you\\r\\nback there with young Creevey - if he was photographing me,\\r\\ntoo, your schoolmates won\\'t think you\\'re setting yourself up so\\r\\nmuch . . . .\"\\r\\nDeaf to Harry\\'s stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor\\r\\nlined with staring students and up a staircase.\\r\\n\"Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of\\r\\nyour career isn\\'t sensible - looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be\\r\\nfrank. There may well come a time when, like me, you\\'ll need to\\r\\nkeep a stack handy wherever you go, but\" - he gave a little chor\\r\\ntle - \"I don\\'t think you\\'re quite there yet.\"\\r\\nThey had reached Lockhart\\'s classroom and he let Harry go at\\r\\n98\\r\\nlast. Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very\\r\\nback of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven of\\r\\nLockhart\\'s books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at the\\r\\nreal thing.\\r\\n85\\r\\nThe rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Hermione sat\\r\\ndown on either side of Harry.\\r\\n\"You could\\'ve fried an egg on your face\" said Ron. \"You\\'d better hope\\r\\nCreevey doesn\\'t meet Ginny, or they\\'ll be starting a Harry Potter fan\\r\\nclub.\"\\r\\n\"Shut up,\" snapped Harry. The last thing he needed was for Lockhart\\r\\nto hear the phrase \"Harry Potter fan club.\"\\r\\nWhen the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared his throat loudly\\r\\nand silence fell. He reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom\\'s\\r\\ncopy of Travels with Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winking\\r\\nportrait on the front.\\r\\n\"Me,\" he said, pointing at it and winking as well. \"Gilderoy Lockhart,\\r\\nOrder of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force\\r\\nDefense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly\\'s Most-\\r\\nCharming-Smile Award - but I don\\'t talk about that. I didn\\'t get rid of\\r\\nthe Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!\"\\r\\nHe waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly.\\r\\n\"I see you\\'ve all bought a complete set of my books -well done. I\\r\\nthought we\\'d start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about\\r\\njust to check how well you\\'ve read them, how much you\\'ve taken in -\"\\r\\nWhen he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of\\r\\nthe class and said, \"You have thirty minutes - start - now!\"\\r\\nHarry looked down at his paper and read:\\r\\n1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart \\'s favorite color?\\r\\n2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s secret ambition?\\r\\n3. What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s greatest\\r\\nachievement to date?\\r\\n86\\r\\nOn and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to:\\r\\n54. When is Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s birthday, and what would his\\r\\nideal gift be?\\r\\nHalf an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through\\r\\nthem in front of the class.\\r\\n\"Tut, tut - hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is\\r\\nlilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. And a few of you need to read\\r\\nWanderings with Werewolves more carefully - I clearly state in chapter\\r\\ntwelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all\\r\\nmagic and non-magic peoples - though I wouldn\\'t say no to a large\\r\\nbottle of Ogdeds Old Firewhisky!\"\\r\\nHe gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring at\\r\\nLockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face; Seamus\\r\\nFinnigan and Dean Thomas, who were sitting in front, were shaking\\r\\nwith silent laughter. Hermione, on the other hand, was listening to\\r\\nLockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her\\r\\nname.\\r\\n\". . . but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the\\r\\nworld of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions - good\\r\\ngirl! In fact\" - he flipped her paper over - \"full marks! Where is Miss\\r\\nHermione Granger?\"\\r\\n*100*\\r\\nHermione raised a trembling hand.\\r\\n\"Excellent!\" beamed Lockhart. \"Quite excellent! Take ten points for\\r\\nGryffindor! And so - to business -\"\\r\\nHe bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it.\\r\\n\"Now - be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest\\r\\ncreatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing your\\r\\nworst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst\\r\\nI am here. All I ask is that you remain calm.\"\\r\\nIn spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of books for a better\\r\\n87\\r\\nlook at the cage. Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean and\\r\\nSeamus had stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering in his front\\r\\nrow seat.\\r\\n\"I must ask you not to scream,\" said Lockhart in a low voice. \"It might\\r\\nprovoke them.\"\\r\\nAs the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the cover.\\r\\n\"Yes,\" he said dramatically. \"Freshly caught Cornish pixies. \"\\r\\nSeamus Finnigan couldn\\'t control himself. He let out a snort of\\r\\nlaughter that even Lockhart couldn\\'t mistake for a scream of terror.\\r\\n\"Yes?\" He smiled at Seamus.\\r\\n\"Well, they\\'re not - they\\'re not very - dangerous, are they?\" Seamus\\r\\nchoked.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be so sure!\" said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at\\r\\nSeamus. \"Devilish tricky little blighters they can be!\"\\r\\nThe pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed\\r\\nfaces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies\\r\\narguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they\\r\\n*101*\\r\\nhad started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and\\r\\nmaking bizarre faces at the people nearest them.\\r\\n\"Right, then,\" Lockhart said loudly. \"Let\\'s see what you make of\\r\\nthem!\" And he opened the cage.\\r\\nIt was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like rockets.\\r\\nTwo of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air.\\r\\nSeveral shot straight through the window, showering the back row\\r\\nwith broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more\\r\\neffectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and\\r\\nsprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures\\r\\nfrom the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books\\r\\nand threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the\\r\\n88\\r\\nclass was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the\\r\\niron chandelier in the ceiling.\\r\\n\"Come on now - round them up, round them up, they\\'re only pixies,\"\\r\\nLockhart shouted.\\r\\nHe rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed,\\r\\n\"Peskipiksi Pesternomi!\"\\r\\nIt had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and\\r\\nthrew it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his\\r\\nown desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a\\r\\nsecond later as the chandelier gave way.\\r\\nThe bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relative\\r\\ncalm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry,\\r\\nRon, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, \"Well, I\\'ll\\r\\nask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.\" He\\r\\nswept past them and shut the door quickly behind him.\\r\\n*102*\\r\\n\"Can you believe him?\" roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit\\r\\nhim painfully on the ear.\\r\\n\"He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,\" said Hermione,\\r\\nimmobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and\\r\\nstuffing them back into their cage.\\r\\n\"Hands on? \"said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of\\r\\nreach with its tongue out. \"Hermione, he didn\\'t have a clue what he\\r\\nwas doing -\"\\r\\n\"Rubbish,\" said Hermione. \"You\\'ve read his books - look at all those\\r\\namazing things he\\'s done -\"\\r\\n\"He says he\\'s done,\" Ron muttered.\\r\\narry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight\\r\\nwhenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder\\r\\n89\\r\\nto avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry\\'s\\r\\nschedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, \"All\\r\\nright, Harry?\" six or seven times a day and hear, \"Hello, Colin,\" back,\\r\\nhowever exasperated Harry sounded when he said it.\\r\\nHedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey\\r\\nand Ron\\'s wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday\\r\\nmorning by shooting out of Ron\\'s hand in Charms and hitting tiny old\\r\\nProfessor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large,\\r\\nthrobbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and\\r\\nanother, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and\\r\\nHermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry,\\r\\nhowever, was shaken awake several hours earlier\\r\\n*104*\\r\\nthan he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor\\r\\nQuidditch team.\\r\\n\"Whassamatter?\" said Harry groggily.\\r\\n\"Quidditch practice!\" said Wood. \"Come on!\"\\r\\nHarry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across\\r\\nthe pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn\\'t\\r\\nunderstand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were\\r\\nmaking.\\r\\n\"Oliver,\" Harry croaked. \"It\\'s the crack of dawn.\"\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the\\r\\nmoment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. \"It\\'s part\\r\\nof our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let\\'s go,\"\\r\\nsaid Wood heartily. \"None of the other teams have started training yet;\\r\\nwe\\'re going to be first off the mark this year -\"\\r\\nYawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to\\r\\nfind his Quidditch robes.\\r\\n\"Good man,\" said Wood. \"Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.\\r\\n90\\r\\nWhen he\\'d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for\\r\\nwarmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he\\'d gone and\\r\\nwent down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two\\r\\nThousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the portrait hole when\\r\\nthere was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down\\r\\nthe spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and\\r\\nsomething clutched in his hand.\\r\\n\"I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look what\\r\\nI\\'ve got here! I\\'ve had it developed, I wanted to show you -\"\\r\\n*105*\\r\\nHarry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing\\r\\nunder his nose.\\r\\nA moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm\\r\\nHarry recognized as his own. He was pleased to see that his\\r\\nphotographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be\\r\\ndragged into view. As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and\\r\\nslumped, panting, against the white edge of the picture.\\r\\n\"Will you sign it?\" said Colin eagerly.\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was\\r\\nreally deserted. \"Sorry, Colin, I\\'m in a hurry - Quidditch practice -\"\\r\\nHe climbed through the portrait hole.\\r\\n\"Oh, wow! Wait for me! I\\'ve never watched a Quidditch game\\r\\nbefore!\"\\r\\nColin scrambled through the hole after him.\\r\\n\"It\\'ll be really boring,\" Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his\\r\\nface shining with excitement.\\r\\n\"You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren\\'t\\r\\nyou, Harry? Weren\\'t you?\" said Colin, trotting alongside him. \"You\\r\\nmust be brilliant. I\\'ve never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own\\r\\nbroom? Is that the best one there is?\"\\r\\n91\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t know how to get rid of him. It was like having an\\r\\nextremely talkative shadow.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t really understand Quidditch,\" said Colin breathlessly. \"Is it\\r\\ntrue there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock\\r\\npeople off their brooms?\"\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated\\r\\nrules of Quidditch. \"They\\'re called Bludgers. There are two Beaters\\r\\n), *106*\\r\\non each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their\\r\\nside. Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.\"\\r\\n\"And what are the other balls for?\" Colin asked, tripping down a\\r\\ncouple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry.\\r\\n\"Well, the Quafe - that\\'s the biggish red one - is the one that scores\\r\\ngoals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other\\r\\nand try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch -\\r\\nthey\\'re three long poles with hoops on the end.\"\\r\\n\"And the fourth ball -\"\\r\\n\"- is the Golden Snitch,\" said Harry, \"and it\\'s very small, very fast, and\\r\\ndifficult to catch. But that\\'s what the Seeker\\'s got to do, because a\\r\\ngame of Quidditch doesn\\'t end until the Snitch has been caught. And\\r\\nwhichever team\\'s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra\\r\\nhundred and fifty points.\"\\r\\n\"And you\\'re the Gryffindor Seeker, aren\\'t you?\" said Colin in awe.\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dewdrenched\\r\\ngrass. \"And there\\'s the Keeper, too. He guards the goal\\r\\nposts. That\\'s it, really.\"\\r\\nBut Colin didn\\'t stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping\\r\\nlawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he\\r\\nreached the changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice,\\r\\n\"I\\'ll go and get a good seat, Harry!\" and hurried off to the stands.\\r\\n92\\r\\nThe rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room.\\r\\nWood was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George\\r\\nWeasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and touslehaired, next to fourth year\\r\\nAlicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind\\r\\nher. Her fellow Chasers, Katie\\r\\n*107*\\r\\nBell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\"There you are, Harry, what kept you?\" said Wood briskly. \"Now, I\\r\\nwanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field,\\r\\nbecause I spent the summer devising a whole new training program,\\r\\nwhich I really think will make all the difference ....\\r\\nWood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which\\r\\nwere drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in differentcolored inks.\\r\\nHe took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to\\r\\nwiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood launched into a\\r\\nspeech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley\\'s head drooped right\\r\\nonto Alicia Spinnet\\'s shoulder and he began to snore.\\r\\nThe first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was\\r\\nanother board under that, and a third under that one. Harry sank into\\r\\na stupor as Wood droned on and on.\\r\\n\"So,\" said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy\\r\\nabout what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up\\r\\nat the castle. \"Is that clear? Any questions?\"\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got a question, Oliver,\" said George, who had woken with a\\r\\nstart. \"Why couldn\\'t you have told us all this yesterday when we\\r\\nwere awake?\"\\r\\nWood wasn\\'t pleased.\\r\\n\"Now, listen here, you lot,\" he said, glowering at them all. \"We\\r\\nshould have won the Quidditch cup last year. We\\'re easily the best\\r\\nteam. But unfortunately -owing to circumstances beyond our control -\\r\\n\"\\r\\n93\\r\\n*108*\\r\\nHarry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the\\r\\nhospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that\\r\\nGryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst\\r\\ndefeat in three hundred years.\\r\\nWood took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeat\\r\\nwas clearly still torturing him.\\r\\n\"So this year, we train harder than ever before .... Okay, let\\'s go and\\r\\nput our new theories into practice!\" Wood shouted, seizing his\\r\\nbroomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms. Stifflegged\\r\\nand still yawning, his team followed.\\r\\nThey had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up\\r\\ncompletely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the\\r\\nstadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione\\r\\nsitting in the stands.\\r\\n\"Aren\\'t you finished yet?\" called Ron incredulously.\\r\\n\"Haven\\'t even started,\" said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and\\r\\nmarmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall.\\r\\n\"Wood\\'s been teaching us new moves.\"\\r\\nHe mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into\\r\\nthe air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more\\r\\neffectively than Wood\\'s long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the\\r\\nQuidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed,\\r\\nracing Fred and George.\\r\\n\"What\\'s that funny clicking noise?\" called Fred as they hurtled around\\r\\nthe corner.\\r\\nHarry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highest\\r\\nseats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound\\r\\nstrangely magnified in the deserted stadium.\\r\\n*io9*\\r\\n94\\r\\n\"Look this way, Harry! This way!\" he cried shrilly.\\r\\n\"Who\\'s that?\" said Fred.\\r\\n\"No idea,\" Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far\\r\\naway as possible from Colin.\\r\\n\"What\\'s going on?\" said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the\\r\\nair toward them. \"Why\\'s that first year taking pictures? I don\\'t like it.\\r\\nHe could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training\\r\\nprogram.\"\\r\\n\"He\\'s in Gryffindor,\" said Harry quickly.\\r\\n\"And the Slytherins don\\'t need a spy, Oliver,\" said George.\\r\\n\"What makes you say that?\" said Wood testily.\\r\\n\"Because they\\'re here in person,\" said George, pointing.\\r\\nSeveral people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks\\r\\nin their hands.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe it!\" Wood hissed in outrage. \"I booked the field for\\r\\ntoday! We\\'ll see about this!\"\\r\\nWood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to\\r\\nin his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harry, Fred, and\\r\\nGeorge followed.\\r\\n\"Flint!\" Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. \"This is our practice\\r\\ntime! We got up specially! You can clear off now!\"\\r\\nMarcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a look of trollish\\r\\ncunning on his face as he replied, \"Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.\"\\r\\nAngelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls\\r\\non the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the\\r\\nGryffindors, leering to a man.\\r\\n\"But I booked the field!\" said Wood, positively spitting with rage. \"I\\r\\nbooked it!\"\\r\\n95\\r\\n*110*\\r\\n\"Ah,\" said Flint. \"But I\\'ve got a specially signed note here from\\r\\nProfessor Snape. `I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team\\r\\npermission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to\\r\\ntrain their new Seeker.\"\\'\\r\\n\"You\\'ve got a new Seeker?\" said Wood, distracted. \"Where?\"\\r\\nAnd from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh,\\r\\nsmaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was Draco\\r\\nMalfoy.\\r\\n\"Aren\\'t you Lucius Malfoy\\'s son?\" said Fred, looking at Malfoy with\\r\\ndislike.\\r\\n\"Funny you should mention Draco\\'s father,\" said Flint as the whole\\r\\nSlytherin team smiled still more broadly. \"Let me show you the\\r\\ngenerous gift he\\'s made to the Slytherin team.\"\\r\\nAll seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished,\\r\\nbrand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the\\r\\nwords Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors\\'\\r\\nnoses in the early morning sun.\\r\\n\"Very latest model. Only came out last month,\" said Flint carelessly,\\r\\nflicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. \"I believe it outstrips\\r\\nthe old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the old\\r\\nCleansweeps\" - he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both\\r\\nclutching Cleansweep Fives - \"sweeps the board with them.\"\\r\\nNone of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a\\r\\nmoment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced\\r\\nto slits.\\r\\n\"Oh, look,\" said Flint. \"A field invasion.\"\\r\\nRon and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on.\\r\\n*111*\\r\\n96\\r\\n\"What\\'s happening?\" Ron asked Harry. \"Why aren\\'t you playing? And\\r\\nwhat\\'s he doing here?\"\\r\\nHe was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes.\\r\\n\"I\\'m the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,\" said Malfoy, smugly.\\r\\n\"Everyone\\'s just been admiring the brooms my father\\'s bought our\\r\\nteam.\\r\\nRon gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\"Good, aren\\'t they?\" said Malfoy smoothly. \"But perhaps the\\r\\nGryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms,\\r\\ntoo. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum\\r\\nwould bid for them.\"\\r\\nThe Slytherin team howled with laughter.\\r\\n\"At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,\" said\\r\\nHermione sharply. \"They got in on pure talent.\"\\r\\nThe smug look on Malfoy\\'s face flickered.\\r\\n\"No one asked your opinion, you fiIthy little Mudblood,\" he spat.\\r\\nHarry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad\\r\\nbecause there was an instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive in\\r\\nfront of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia\\r\\nshrieked, \"How dare you!\" ; and Ron plunged his hand into his robes,\\r\\npulled out his wand, yelling, \"You\\'ll pay for that one, Malfoy!\" and\\r\\npointed it furiously under Flint\\'s arm at Malfoys face.\\r\\nA loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot\\r\\nout of the wrong end of Ron\\'s wand, hitting him in the stomach and\\r\\nsending him reeling backward onto the grass.\\r\\n12\\r\\n\"Ron! Ron! Are you all right?\" squealed Hermione.\\r\\nRon opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead he\\r\\n97\\r\\ngave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth\\r\\nonto his lap.\\r\\nThe Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. Flint was doubled\\r\\nup, hanging onto his new broomstick for support. Malfoy was on all\\r\\nfours, banging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were\\r\\ngathered around Ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs.\\r\\nNobody seemed to want to touch him.\\r\\n\"We\\'d better get him to Hagrid\\'s, it\\'s nearest,\" said Harry to\\r\\nHermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up\\r\\nby the arms.\\r\\n\"What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? But you can\\r\\ncure him, can\\'t you?\" Colin had run down from his seat and was now\\r\\ndancing alongside them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave\\r\\nand more slugs dribbled down his front.\\r\\n\"Oooh,\" said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. \"Can you hold\\r\\nhim still, Harry?\"\\r\\n\"Get out of the way, Colin!\" said Harry angrily. He and Hermione\\r\\nsupported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward\\r\\nthe edge of the forest.\\r\\n\"Nearly there, Ron,\" said Hermione as the gamekeeper\\'s cabin came\\r\\ninto view. \"You\\'ll be all right in a minute - almost there -\"\\r\\nThey were within twenty feet of Hagrid\\'s house when the front door\\r\\nopened, but it wasn\\'t Hagrid who emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart,\\r\\nwearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out.\\r\\n\"Quick, behind here,\" Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearby\\r\\nbush. Hermione followed, somewhat reluctantly.\\r\\n*113* *\\r\\n\"It\\'s a simple matter if you know what you\\'re doing!\" Lockhart was\\r\\nsaying loudly to Hagrid. \"If you need help, you know where I am! I\\'ll\\r\\nlet you have a copy of my book. I\\'m surprised you haven\\'t already got\\r\\none - I\\'ll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!\" And he\\r\\nstrode away toward the castle.\\r\\n98\\r\\nHarry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled Ron out of\\r\\nthe bush and up to Hagrid\\'s front door. They knocked urgently.\\r\\nHagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression\\r\\nbrightened when he saw who it was.\\r\\n\"Bin wonderin\\' when you\\'d come ter see me - come in, come in -\\r\\nthought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again -\"\\r\\nHarry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the oneroomed\\r\\ncabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire\\r\\ncrackling merrily in the other. Hagrid didn\\'t seem perturbed by Ron\\'s\\r\\nslug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he lowered Ron into a\\r\\nchair.\\r\\n\"Better out than in,\" he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in\\r\\nfront of him. \"Get \\'em all up, Ron.\"\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think there\\'s anything to do except wait for it to stop,\" said\\r\\nHermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin. \"That\\'s a\\r\\ndifficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand -\"\\r\\nHagrid was bustling around making them tea. His boarhound, Fang,\\r\\nwas slobbering over Harry.\\r\\n\"What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?\" Harry asked, scratching\\r\\nFang\\'s ears.\\r\\n\"Givin\\' me advice on gettin\\' kelpies out of a well,\" growled\\r\\n*114*\\r\\nHagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off his scrubbed table and\\r\\nsetting down the teapot. \"Like I don\\' know. An\\' bangin\\' on about\\r\\nsome banshee he banished. If one word of it was true, I\\'ll eat my\\r\\nkettle.\"\\r\\nIt was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts\\' teacher, and Harry\\r\\nlooked at him in surprise. Hermione, however, said in a voice\\r\\nsomewhat higher than usual, \"I think you\\'re being a bit unfair.\\r\\nProfessor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for\\r\\n99\\r\\nthe job -\"\\r\\n\"He was the on\\' man for the job,\" said Hagrid, offering them a Y\\r\\nplate of treacle fudge, while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin.\\r\\n\"An\\' I mean the on\\' one. Gettin\\' very difficult ter find anyone fer Y\\r\\nthe Dark Arts job. People aren\\'t too keen ter take it on, see. They\\'re\\r\\nstartin\\' ter think it\\'s jinxed. No one\\'s lasted long fer a while now. So\\r\\ntell me,\" said Hagrid, jerking his head at Ron. \"Who was he tryin\\' ter\\r\\ncurse?\"\\r\\n\"Malfoy called Hermione something - it must\\'ve been really bad,\\r\\nbecause everyone went wild.\"\\r\\n\"It was bad,\" said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking\\r\\npale and sweaty. \"Malfoy called her `Mudblood,\\' Hagrid -\"\\r\\nRon dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their\\r\\nappearance. Hagrid looked outraged.\\r\\n\"He didn\\'!\" he growled at Hermione.\\r\\n\"He did,\" she said. \"But I don\\'t know what it means. I could tell it\\r\\nwas really rude, of course -\"\\r\\n\"It\\'s about the most insulting thing he could think of,\" gasped Ron,\\r\\ncoming back up. \"Mudblood\\'s a really foul name for someone who is\\r\\nMuggle-born - you know, non-magic parents. There are\\r\\n*115*\\r\\nsome wizards - like Malfoy\\'s family - who think they\\'re better than\\r\\neveryone else because they\\'re what people call pure-blood.\" He\\r\\ngave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand. He\\r\\nthrew it into the basin and continued, \"I mean, the rest of us know it\\r\\ndoesn\\'t make any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom -\\r\\nhe\\'s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way\\r\\nup.\"\\r\\n\"An\\' they haven\\'t invented a spell our Hermione can\\' do,\" said Hagrid\\r\\nproudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta.\\r\\n100\\r\\n\"It\\'s a disgusting thing to call someone,\" said Ron, wiping his sweaty\\r\\nbrow with a shaking hand. \"Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It\\'s\\r\\nridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we\\r\\nhadn\\'t married Muggles we\\'d\\'ve died out.\"\\r\\nHe retched and ducked out of sight again.\\r\\n\"Well, I don\\' blame yeh fer tryin\\' ter curse him, Ron,\" said Hagrid\\r\\nloudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin. \"Bu\\' maybe it\\r\\nwas a good thing yer wand backfired. \\'Spect Lucius Malfoy\\r\\nwould\\'ve come marchin\\' up ter school if yeh\\'d cursed his son. Least\\r\\nyer not in trouble.\"\\r\\nHarry would have pointed out that trouble didn\\'t come much worse\\r\\nthan having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn\\'t; Hagrid\\'s\\r\\ntreacle fudge had cemented his jaws together.\\r\\n\"Harry,\" said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought.\\r\\n\"Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I\\'ve heard you\\'ve bin givin\\' out signed\\r\\nphotos. How come I haven\\'t got one?\"\\r\\nFurious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart.\\r\\n\"I have not been giving out signed photos,\" he said hotly. \"If\\r\\nLockhart\\'s still spreading that around -\"\\r\\n*116*\\r\\nBut then he saw that Hagrid was laughing.\\r\\n\"I\\'m on\\'y jokin\\',\" he said, patting Harry genially on the back and\\r\\nsending him face first into the table. \"I knew yeh hadn\\'t really. I told\\r\\nLockhart yeh didn\\' need teh. Yer more famous than him without\\r\\ntryin\\'.\"\\r\\n\"Bet he didn\\'t like that,\" said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin.\\r\\n\"Don\\' think he did,\" said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling. \"An\\' then I told\\r\\nhim Id never read one o\\' his books an\\' he decided ter go. Treacle\\r\\nfudge, Ron?\" he added as Ron reappeared.\\r\\n101\\r\\n\"No thanks,\" said Ron weakly. \"Better not risk it.\"\\r\\n\"Come an\\' see what I\\'ve bin growin\\',\" said Hagrid as Harry and\\r\\nHermione finished the last of their tea.\\r\\nIn the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid\\'s house were a dozen of\\r\\nthe largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen. Each was the size of a\\r\\nlarge boulder.\\r\\n\"Gettin\\' on well, aren\\'t they?\" said Hagrid happily. \"Fer the Halloween\\r\\nfeast ... should be big enough by then.\"\\r\\n\"What\\'ve you been feeding them?\" said Harry.\\r\\nHagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone.\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'ve bin givin\\' them - you know - a bit o\\' help -\"\\r\\nHarry noticed Hagrid\\'s flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back\\r\\nwall of the cabin. Harry had had reason to believe before now that\\r\\nthis umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong\\r\\nimpression that Hagrid\\'s old school wand was concealed inside it.\\r\\nHagrid wasn\\'t supposed to use magic. He had been expelled from\\r\\nHogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why -any\\r\\nmention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his\\r\\n*117*\\r\\nthroat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was\\r\\nchanged.\\r\\n\"An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?\" said Hermione, halfway\\r\\nbetween disapproval and amusement. \"Well, you\\'ve done a good job on\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s what yer little sister said,\" said Hagrid, nodding at Ron. \"Met\\r\\nher jus\\' yesterday.\" Hagrid looked sideways at Harry, his beard\\r\\ntwitching. \"Said she was jus\\' lookin\\' round the grounds, but I reckon\\r\\nshe was hopin\\' she might run inter someone else at my house.\" He\\r\\nwinked at Harry. \"If yeh ask me, she wouldn\\' say no ter a signed -\"\\r\\n\"Oh, shut up,\" said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter and the ground\\r\\n102\\r\\nwas sprayed with slugs.\\r\\n\"Watch it!\" Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious\\r\\npumpkins.\\r\\nIt was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle\\r\\nfudge since dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat. They said\\r\\ngood-bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing\\r\\noccasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs.\\r\\nThey had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang\\r\\nout, \"There you are, Potter - Weasley.\" Professor McGonagall was\\r\\nwalking toward them, looking stern. \"You will both do your detentions\\r\\nthis evening.\"\\r\\n\"What\\'re we doing, Professor?\" said Ron, nervously suppressing a\\r\\nburp.\\r\\n\"You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch,\"\\r\\nsaid Professor McGonagall. \"And no magic, Weasley - elbow grease.\"\\r\\n*118*\\r\\nRon gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student\\r\\nin the school.\\r\\n\"And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan\\r\\nmail,\" said Professor McGonagall.\\r\\n\"Oh n - Professor, can\\'t I go and do the trophy room, too?\" said Harry\\r\\ndesperately.\\r\\n\"Certainly not,\" said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows.\\r\\n\"Professor Lockhart requested you particularly. Eight o\\'clock sharp,\\r\\nboth of you.\"\\r\\nHarry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest\\r\\ngloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-schoolrules\\r\\nsort of expression. Harry didn\\'t enjoy his shepherd\\'s pie as\\r\\nmuch as he\\'d thought. Both he and Ron felt they\\'d got the worse deal.\\r\\n\"Filch\\'ll have me there all night,\" said Ron heavily. \"No magic! There\\r\\n103\\r\\nmust be about a hundred cups in that room. I\\'m no good at Muggle\\r\\ncleaning.\"\\r\\n\"I\\'d swap anytime,\" said Harry hollowly. \"I\\'ve had loads of practice\\r\\nwith the Dursleys. Answering Lockhart\\'s fan mail ... he\\'ll be a\\r\\nnightmare ......\\r\\nSaturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no\\r\\ntime, it was five minutes to eight, and Harry was dragging his feet\\r\\nalong the second-floor corridor to Lockhart\\'s office. He gritted his\\r\\nteeth and knocked.\\r\\nThe door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at him.\\r\\n\"Ah, here\\'s the scalawag!\" he said. \"Come in, Harry, come in -\"\\r\\nShining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were\\r\\ncountless framed photographs of Lockhart. He had even signed a few\\r\\nof them. Another large pile lay on his desk.\\r\\n\"You can address the envelopes!\" Lockhart told Harry, as though\\r\\nthis was a huge treat. \"This first one\\'s to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her -\\r\\nhuge fan of mine -\"\\r\\nThe minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart\\'s voice wash over him,\\r\\noccasionally saying, \"Mmm\" and \"Right\" and \"Yeah.\" Now and then\\r\\nhe caught a phrase like, \"Fame\\'s a fickle friend, Harry,\" or \"Celebrity\\r\\nis as celebrity does, remember that.\"\\r\\nThe candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the\\r\\nmany moving faces of Lockhart watching him. Harry moved his\\r\\naching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out\\r\\nVeronica Smethley\\'s address. It must be nearly time to leave, Harry\\r\\nthought miserably, please let it be nearly time...\\r\\nAnd then he heard something - something quite apart from the\\r\\nspitting of the dying candles and Lockhart\\'s prattle about his fans.\\r\\nIt was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of\\r\\nbreathtaking, ice-cold venom.\\r\\n104\\r\\n\"Come ... come to me.... Let me rip you.... Let me tear you .... Let me kill you . .\\r\\n. .\"\\r\\nHarry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica\\r\\nSmethley\\'s street.\\r\\n\"What?\" he said loudly.\\r\\n\"I know!\" said Lockhart. \"Six solid months at the top of the bestseller\\r\\nlist! Broke all records!\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry frantically. \"That voice!\"\\r\\n\"Sorry?\" said Lockhart, looking puzzled. \"What voice?\"\\r\\n\"That - that voice that said - didn\\'t you hear it?\"\\r\\nLockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment.\\r\\n* 3-2o *\\r\\n\"What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you\\'re getting a litde\\r\\ndrowsy? Great Scott - look at the time! We\\'ve been here nearly four\\r\\nhours! Id never have believed it - the time\\'s flown, hasn\\'t it?\"\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t answer. He was straining his ears to hear the voice again,\\r\\nbut there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn\\'t\\r\\nexpect a treat like this every time he got detention. Feeling dazed,\\r\\nHarry left.\\r\\nIt was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty.\\r\\nHarry went straight up to the dormitory. Ron wasn\\'t back yet. Harry\\r\\npulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, Ron\\r\\narrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into\\r\\nthe darkened room.\\r\\n\"My muscles have all seized up,\" he groaned, sinking on his bed.\\r\\n\"Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch cup before he was\\r\\nsatisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award\\r\\nfor Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off... How was\\r\\nit with Lockhart?\"\\r\\n105\\r\\nKeeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Seamus,\\r\\nHarry told Ron exactly what he had heard.\\r\\n\"And Lockhart said he couldn\\'t hear it?\" said Ron. Harry could see\\r\\nhim frowning in the moonlight. \"D\\'you think he was lying? But I don\\'t\\r\\nget it - even someone invisible would\\'ve had to open the door.\"\\r\\n\"I know,\" said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the\\r\\ncanopy above him. \"I don\\'t get it either.\"\\r\\n* 12-1 *\\r\\n122\\r\\nOctober arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle.\\r\\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among\\r\\nthe staff and students. Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left\\r\\nthe drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley,\\r\\nwho had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The\\r\\nsteam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole\\r\\nhead was on fire.\\r\\nRaindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on\\r\\nend; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid\\'s\\r\\npumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood\\'s enthusiasm for\\r\\nregular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry\\r\\nwas to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before\\r\\nHalloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and\\r\\nsplattered with mud..\\r\\n123\\r\\nEven aside from the rain and wind it hadn\\'t been a happy practice session.\\r\\nFred and George, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for\\r\\nthemselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They\\r\\nreported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs,\\r\\nshooting through the air like missiles.\\r\\nAs Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody\\r\\nwho looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost\\r\\nof Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering\\r\\nunder his breath, \". . . don\\'t fulfill their requirements . . . half an inch, if that .\\r\\n. .\"\\r\\n\"Hello, Nick,\" said Harry.\\r\\n106\\r\\n\"Hello, hello,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He\\r\\nwore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff,\\r\\nwhich concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He\\r\\nwas pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky\\r\\nand torrential rain outside.\\r\\n\"You look troubled, young Potter,\" said Nick, folding a transparent letter as\\r\\nhe spoke and tucking it inside his doublet.\\r\\n\"So do you,\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Ah,\" Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, \"a matter of no\\r\\nimportance. . . . It\\'s not as though I really wanted to join. . . . Thought I\\'d\\r\\napply, but apparently I \\'don\\'t fulfill requirements\\' -\"\\r\\nIn spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.\\r\\n\"But you would think, wouldn\\'t you,\" he erupted suddenly, pulling the letter\\r\\nback out of his pocket, \"that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a\\r\\nblunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?\"\\r\\n124\\r\\n\"Oh - yes,\" said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree.\\r\\n\"I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean,\\r\\nand my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great\\r\\ndeal of pain and ridicule. However -\" Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter\\r\\nopen and read furiously: \"\\'We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have\\r\\nparted company with their bodies. You will appreciate that it would be\\r\\nimpossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as\\r\\nHorseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret,\\r\\ntherefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements.\\r\\nWith very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.\\'\"\\r\\nFuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away.\\r\\n\"Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people\\r\\nwould think that\\'s good and beheaded, but oh, no, it\\'s not enough for Sir\\r\\nProperly Decapitated-Podmore.\"\\r\\nNearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far\\r\\ncalmer tone, \"So - what\\'s bothering you? Anything I can do?\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"Not unless you know where we can get seven free\\r\\nNimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly -\"\\r\\nThe rest of Harry\\'s sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling\\r\\nfrom somewhere near his ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing\\r\\ninto a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat\\r\\nwho was used by the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his\\r\\nendless battle against students.\\r\\n\"You\\'d better get out of here, Harry,\" said Nick quickly. \"Filch isn\\'t in a\\r\\n107\\r\\ngood mood - he\\'s got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog\\r\\nbrains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He\\'s been cleaning all morning,\\r\\nand if he sees you dripping mud all over the place -\"\\r\\n.125\\r\\n\"Right,\" said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris,\\r\\nbut not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that\\r\\nseemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through\\r\\na tapestry to Harry\\'s right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-breaker.\\r\\nThere was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose\\r\\nwas unusually purple.\\r\\n\"Filth!\" he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he\\r\\npointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry\\'s Quidditch robes.\\r\\n\"Mess and muck everywhere! I\\'ve had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me,\\r\\nPotter!\"\\r\\nSo Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed\\r\\nFilch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the\\r\\nfloor.\\r\\nHarry had never been inside Filch\\'s office before; it was a place most\\r\\nstudents avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil\\r\\nlamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about\\r\\nthe place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels,\\r\\nHarry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever\\r\\npunished. Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A\\r\\nhighly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind\\r\\nFilch\\'s desk. It was common knowledge that he was always begging\\r\\nDumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.\\r\\nFilch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around\\r\\nlooking for parchment.\\r\\n\"Dung,\" he muttered furiously, \"great sizzling dragon bogies . . . frog brains\\r\\n. . . rat intestines . . . I\\'ve had enough of it . . . make an example . . . where\\'s\\r\\nthe form . . . yes . . .\"\\r\\n.126\\r\\nHe retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it\\r\\nout in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot.\\r\\n\"Name . . . Harry Potter. Crime . . .\"\\r\\n\"It was only a bit of mud!\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"It\\'s only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it\\'s an extra hour scrubbing!\"\\r\\nshouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose.\\r\\n\"Crime . . . befouling the castle . . . suggested sentence . . .\"\\r\\nDabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry who\\r\\n108\\r\\nwaited with bated breath for his sentence to fall.\\r\\nBut as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of\\r\\nthe office, which made the oil lamp rattle.\\r\\n\"PEEVES!\" Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage. \"I\\'ll\\r\\nhave you this time, I\\'ll have you!\"\\r\\nAnd without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the\\r\\noffice, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him.\\r\\nPeeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to\\r\\ncause havoc and distress. Harry didn\\'t much like Peeves, but couldn\\'t help\\r\\nfeeling grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and it\\r\\nsounded as though he\\'d wrecked something very big this time) would\\r\\ndistract Filch from Harry.\\r\\nThinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank\\r\\ninto a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart\\r\\nfrom his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver\\r\\nlettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch\\r\\nwasn\\'t on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read: kwikspell A\\r\\nCorrespondence Course in Beginners\\' Magic.\\r\\n127\\r\\nIntrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of\\r\\nparchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said: Feel out\\r\\nof step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not to\\r\\nperform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork? There\\r\\nis an answer! Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn\\r\\ncourse. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell\\r\\nmethod! Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: \"I had no memory for\\r\\nincantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell\\r\\ncourse, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of\\r\\nmy Scintillation Solution!\" Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: \"My wife\\r\\nused to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous\\r\\nKwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak! Thank you,\\r\\nKwikspell!\"\\r\\nFascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope\\'s contents. Why\\r\\non earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn\\'t a\\r\\nproper wizard? Harry was just reading \"Lesson One: Holding Your Wand\\r\\n(Some Useful Tips)\" when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was\\r\\ncoming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it\\r\\nback onto the desk just as the door opened.\\r\\nFilch was looking triumphant.\\r\\n\"That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!\" he was saying gleefully to\\r\\nMrs. Norris. \"We\\'ll have Peeves out this time, my sweet -\"\\r\\n109\\r\\nHis eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which,\\r\\nHarry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started.\\r\\nFilch\\'s pasty face went brick red. Harry braced himself for a tidal wave of\\r\\nfury. Filch hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it\\r\\ninto a drawer.\\r\\n\"Have you - did you read -?\" he sputtered.\\r\\n.128\\r\\n\"No,\" Harry lied quickly.\\r\\nFilch\\'s knobbly hands were twisting together.\\r\\n\"If I thought you\\'d read my private - not that it\\'s mine - for a friend - be that\\r\\nas it may - however -\"\\r\\nHarry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder. His eyes\\r\\nwere popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan\\r\\nscarf didn\\'t help.\\r\\n\"Very well - go - and don\\'t breathe a word - not that - however, if you didn\\'t\\r\\nread - go now, I have to write up Peeves\\' report - go -\"\\r\\nAmazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back\\r\\nupstairs. To escape from Filch\\'s office without punishment was probably\\r\\nsome kind of school record.\\r\\n\"Harry! Harry! Did it work?\"\\r\\nNearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. Behind him, Harry\\r\\ncould see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to\\r\\nhave been dropped from a great height.\\r\\n\"I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch\\'s office,\" said Nick eagerly.\\r\\n\"Thought it might distract him -\"\\r\\n\"Was that you?\" said Harry gratefully. \"Yeah, it worked, I didn\\'t even get\\r\\ndetention. Thanks, Nick!\"\\r\\nThey set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed,\\r\\nwas still holding Sir Patrick\\'s rejection letter..\\r\\n129\\r\\n\"I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,\"\\r\\nHarry said.\\r\\nNearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right through\\r\\nhim. He wished he hadn\\'t; it was like stepping through an icy shower.\\r\\n\"But there is something you could do for me,\" said Nick excitedly. \"Harry -\\r\\nwould I be asking too much - but no, you wouldn\\'t want -\"\\r\\n\"What is it?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,\" said Nearly\\r\\nHeadless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified.\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this.\\r\\n110\\r\\n\"Right.\"\\r\\n\"I\\'m holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be\\r\\ncoming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would\\r\\nattend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, of\\r\\ncourse - but I daresay you\\'d rather go to the school feast?\" He watched Harry\\r\\non tenterhooks.\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry quickly, \"I\\'ll come -\"\\r\\n\"My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! And\" - he hesitated,\\r\\nlooking excited - \"do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick\\r\\nhow very frightening and impressive you find me?\"\\r\\n\"Of - of course,\" said Harry.\\r\\nNearly Headless Nick beamed at him. \"A deathday party?\" said Hermione\\r\\nkeenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in the\\r\\ncommon room. \"I bet there aren\\'t many living people who can say they\\'ve\\r\\nbeen to one of those - it\\'ll be fascinating!\".\\r\\n130\\r\\n\"Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?\" said Ron, who\\r\\nwas halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy. \"Sounds dead\\r\\ndepressing to me. . . .\"\\r\\nRain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside\\r\\nall looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countless\\r\\nsquashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in\\r\\nthe case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen\\r\\nif you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had \"rescued\" the\\r\\nbrilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class\\r\\nand it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of\\r\\ncurious people.\\r\\nHarry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the\\r\\nKwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air,\\r\\nemitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The\\r\\nsight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular\\r\\ndisplay of tangerine stars showering from the salamander\\'s mouth, and its\\r\\nescape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the\\r\\nKwikspell envelope from Harry\\'s mind. By the time Halloween arrived,\\r\\nHarry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest of\\r\\nthe school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had\\r\\nbeen decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid\\'s vast pumpkins had been\\r\\ncarved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were\\r\\nrumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the\\r\\nentertainment.\\r\\n\"A promise is a promise,\" Hermione reminded Harry bossily. \"You said\\r\\n111\\r\\nyou\\'d go to the deathday party.\"\\r\\nSo at seven o\\'clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the\\r\\ndoorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold\\r\\nplates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons.\\r\\n.131\\r\\nThe passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick\\'s party had been lined\\r\\nwith candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long,\\r\\nthin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light\\r\\neven over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step\\r\\nthey took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he\\r\\nheard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous\\r\\nblackboard.\\r\\n\"Is that supposed to be music?\" Ron whispered. They turned a corner and\\r\\nsaw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet\\r\\ndrapes.\\r\\n\"My dear friends,\" he said mournfully. \"Welcome, welcome . . . so pleased\\r\\nyou could come. . . .\"\\r\\nHe swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside.\\r\\nIt was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white,\\r\\ntranslucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor,\\r\\nwaltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by\\r\\nan orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead\\r\\nblazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose\\r\\nin a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer.\\r\\n\"Shall we have a look around?\" Harry suggested, wanting to warm up his\\r\\nfeet.\\r\\n\"Careful not to walk through anyone,\" said Ron nervously, and they set off\\r\\naround the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a\\r\\nragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost,\\r\\nwho was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry\\r\\nwasn\\'t surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin\\r\\nghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the\\r\\nother ghosts.\\r\\n.132\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said Hermione, stopping abruptly. \"Turn back, turn back, I don\\'t\\r\\nwant to talk to Moaning Myrtle -\"\\r\\n\"Who?\" said Harry as they backtracked quickly.\\r\\n\"She haunts one of the toilets in the girls\\' bathroom on the first floor,\" said\\r\\nHermione.\\r\\n\"She haunts a toilet?\"\\r\\n112\\r\\n\"Yes. It\\'s been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and\\r\\nflooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it\\'s awful\\r\\ntrying to have a pee with her wailing at you -\"\\r\\n\"Look, food!\" said Ron.\\r\\nOn the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black\\r\\nvelvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their\\r\\ntracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish were laid\\r\\non handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on\\r\\nsalvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry\\r\\ngreen mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a\\r\\ntombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-\\r\\nPorpington\\r\\ndied 31st October, 1492\\r\\nHarry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched\\r\\nlow, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through\\r\\none of the stinking salmon.\\r\\n\"Can you taste it if you walk though it?\" Harry asked him.\\r\\n\"Almost,\" said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away.\\r\\n.133\\r\\n\"I expect they\\'ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,\" said Hermione\\r\\nknowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid\\r\\nhaggis.\\r\\n\"Can we move? I feel sick,\" said Ron.\\r\\nThey had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped\\r\\nsuddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them.\\r\\n\"Hello, Peeves,\" said Harry cautiously.\\r\\nUnlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse\\r\\nof pale and transparent. He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a\\r\\nrevolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face.\\r\\n\"Nibbles?\" he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in\\r\\nfungus.\\r\\n\"No thanks,\" said Hermione.\\r\\n\"Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,\" said Peeves, his eyes dancing.\\r\\n\"Rude you was about poor Myrtle.\" He took a deep breath and bellowed,\\r\\n\"OY! MYRTLE!\"\\r\\n\"Oh, no, Peeves, don\\'t tell her what I said, she\\'ll be really upset,\" Hermione\\r\\nwhispered frantically. \"I didn\\'t mean it, I don\\'t mind her - er, hello, Myrtle.\"\\r\\nThe squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face Harry\\r\\nhad ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.\\r\\n\"What?\" she said sulkily.\\r\\n\"How are you, Myrtle?\" said Hermione in a falsely bright voice. \"It\\'s nice to\\r\\n113\\r\\nsee you out of the toilet.\"\\r\\n.134\\r\\nMyrtle sniffed.\\r\\n\"Miss Granger was just talking about you -\" said Peeves slyly in Myrtle\\'s\\r\\near.\\r\\n\"Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight,\" said Hermione, glaring\\r\\nat Peeves.\\r\\nMyrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously.\\r\\n\"You\\'re making fun of me,\" she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her\\r\\nsmall, see-through eyes.\\r\\n\"No - honestly - didn\\'t I just say how nice Myrtle\\'s looking?\" said\\r\\nHermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs.\\r\\n\"Oh, yeah -\"\\r\\n\"She did -\"\\r\\n\"Don\\'t lie to me,\" Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down her face, while\\r\\nPeeves chuckled happily over her shoulder. \"D\\'you think I don\\'t know what\\r\\npeople call me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle! Miserable,\\r\\nmoaning, moping Myrtle!\"\\r\\n\"You\\'ve forgotten pimply,\" Peeves hissed in her ear.\\r\\nMoaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon.\\r\\nPeeves shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, \"Pimply!\\r\\nPimply!\"\\r\\n\"Oh, dear,\" said Hermione sadly.\\r\\nNearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd.\\r\\n.135\\r\\n\"Enjoying yourselves?\"\\r\\n\"Oh, yes,\" they lied.\\r\\n\"Not a bad turnout,\" said Nearly Headless Nick proudly. \"The Wailing\\r\\nWidow came all the way up from Kent. . . . It\\'s nearly time for my speech,\\r\\nI\\'d better go and warn the orchestra. . . .\"\\r\\nThe orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. They, and\\r\\neveryone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a\\r\\nhunting horn sounded.\\r\\n\"Oh, here we go,\" said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly.\\r\\nThrough the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a\\r\\nheadless horseman. The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too,\\r\\nbut stopped quickly at the sight of Nick\\'s face.\\r\\nThe horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing\\r\\nand plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his\\r\\nbearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the horn.\\r\\n114\\r\\nThe ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the\\r\\ncrowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick,\\r\\nsquashing his head back onto his neck.\\r\\n\"Nick!\" he roared. \"How are you? Head still hanging in there?\"\\r\\nHe gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder.\\r\\n\"Welcome, Patrick,\" said Nick stiffly.\\r\\n\"Live \\'uns!\" said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving\\r\\na huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd\\r\\nhowled with laughter).\\r\\n.136\\r\\n\"Very amusing,\" said Nearly Headless Nick darkly.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t mind Nick!\" shouted Sir Patrick\\'s head from the floor. \"Still upset we\\r\\nwon\\'t let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say - look at the fellow -\"\\r\\n\"I think,\" said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, \"Nick\\'s very\\r\\n- frightening and - er -\"\\r\\n\"Ha!\" yelled Sir Patrick\\'s head. \"Bet he asked you to say that!\"\\r\\n\"If I could have everyone\\'s attention, it\\'s time for my speech!\" said Nearly\\r\\nHeadless Nick loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy\\r\\nblue spotlight.\\r\\n\"My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow . . .\"\\r\\nBut nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt\\r\\nhad just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to\\r\\nwatch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his audience, but gave\\r\\nup as Sir Patrick\\'s head went sailing past him to loud cheers.\\r\\nHarry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry.\\r\\n\"I can\\'t stand much more of this,\" Ron muttered, his teeth chattering, as the\\r\\norchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance\\r\\nfloor.\\r\\n\"Let\\'s go,\" Harry agreed.\\r\\nThey backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked\\r\\nat them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of\\r\\nblack candles.\\r\\n\"Pudding might not be finished yet,\" said Ron hopefully, leading the way\\r\\ntoward the steps to the entrance hall.\\r\\n.137\\r\\nAnd then Harry heard it.\\r\\n\". . . rip . . . tear . . . kill . . .\"\\r\\nIt was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in\\r\\nLockhart\\'s office.\\r\\nHe stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his\\r\\n115\\r\\nmight, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway.\\r\\n\"Harry, what\\'re you -?\"\\r\\n\"It\\'s that voice again - shut up a minute -\"\\r\\n\". . . soo hungry . . . for so long . . .\"\\r\\n\"Listen!\" said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching him.\\r\\n\". . . kill . . . time to kill . . .\"\\r\\nThe voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was moving away -\\r\\nmoving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared\\r\\nat the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, to\\r\\nwhom stone ceilings didn\\'t matter?\\r\\n\"This way,\" he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance\\r\\nhall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the\\r\\nHalloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. Harry sprinted up the\\r\\nmarble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him.\\r\\n\"Harry, what\\'re we -\"\\r\\n\"SHH!\"\\r\\n.138\\r\\nHarry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter\\r\\nstill, he heard the voice: \". . . I smell blood. . . . I SMELL BLOOD!\"\\r\\nHis stomach lurched -\\r\\n\"It\\'s going to kill someone!\" he shouted, and ignoring Ron\\'s and Hermione\\'s\\r\\nbewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to\\r\\nlisten over his own pounding footsteps -\\r\\nHarry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione\\r\\npanting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last,\\r\\ndeserted passage.\\r\\n\"Harry, what was that all about?\" said Ron, wiping sweat off his face. \"I\\r\\ncouldn\\'t hear anything. . . .\"\\r\\nBut Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor.\\r\\n\"Look!\"\\r\\nSomething was shining on the wall ahead. They approached slowly,\\r\\nsquinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the\\r\\nwall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming\\r\\ntorches. the chamber of secrets has been opened. enemies of the heir,\\r\\nbeware.\\r\\n\"What\\'s that thing - hanging underneath?\" said Ron, a slight quiver in his\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\nAs they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped - there was a large puddle of\\r\\nwater on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward\\r\\nthe message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All three of them\\r\\nrealized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash..Mrs. Norris,\\r\\n116\\r\\nthe caretaker\\'s cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch\\r\\nbracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring.\\r\\nFor a few seconds, they didn\\'t move. Then Ron said, \"Let\\'s get out of here.\"\\r\\n\"Shouldn\\'t we try and help -\" Harry began awkwardly.\\r\\n\"Trust me,\" said Ron. \"We don\\'t want to be found here.\"\\r\\nBut it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that\\r\\nthe feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stood\\r\\ncame the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy\\r\\ntalk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the\\r\\npassage from both ends.\\r\\nThe chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted\\r\\nthe hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the\\r\\ncorridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see\\r\\nthe grisly sight.\\r\\nThen someone shouted through the quiet.\\r\\n\"Enemies of the Heir, beware! You\\'ll be next, Mudbloods!\"\\r\\nIt was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes\\r\\nalive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the\\r\\nhanging, immobile cat.\\r\\nC H A P T X IR N I N E\\r\\nTHE WRTITING\\r\\nON THE WALL\\r\\nWhat\\'s going on here? What\\'s going on?\" Attracted no doubt by\\r\\nMalfoy\\'s shout, Argus Filch came shouldering his way through the\\r\\ncrowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face in\\r\\nhorror.\\r\\n\"My cat! My cat! What\\'s happened to Mrs. Norris?\" he shrieked.\\r\\nAnd his popping eyes fell on Harry.\\r\\n\"You!\"he screeched. \"You! You\\'ve murdered my cat! You\\'ve\\r\\nkilled her! I\\'ll kill you! I\\'ll -\"\\r\\n\"Argus!\"\\r\\nDumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other\\r\\n117\\r\\nteachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, and Hermione\\r\\nand detached Mrs. Norris from the torch bracket.\\r\\n\"Come with me, Argus,\" he said to Filch. \"You, too, Mr. Potter, Mr.\\r\\nWeasley, Miss Granger.\"\\r\\nLockhart stepped forward eagerly.\\r\\n*140*\\r\\n\"My office is nearest, Headmaster - just upstairs - please feel free -\"\\r\\n\"Thank you, Gilderoy,\" said Dumbledore.\\r\\nThe silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockhart, looking excited and\\r\\nimportant, hurried after Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall\\r\\nand Snape.\\r\\nAs they entered Lockhart\\'s darkened office there was a flurry of\\r\\nmovement across the walls; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in the\\r\\npictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. The real Lockhart lit\\r\\nthe candles on his desk and stood back. Dumbledore lay Mrs. Norris\\r\\non the polished surface and began to examine her. Harry, Ron, and\\r\\nHermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool\\r\\nof candlelight, watching.\\r\\nThe tip of Dumbledore\\'s long, crooked nose was barely an inch from\\r\\nMrs. Norris\\'s fur. He was looking at her closely through his half-moon\\r\\nspectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking. Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed. Snape\\r\\nloomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar\\r\\nexpression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile. And\\r\\nLockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions.\\r\\n\"It was definitely a curse that killed her - probably the Transmogrifian\\r\\nTorture - I\\'ve seen it used many times, so unlucky I wasn\\'t there, I\\r\\nknow the very countercurse that would have saved her . .....\\r\\nLockhart\\'s comments were punctuated by Filch\\'s dry, racking sobs.\\r\\nHe was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris,\\r\\n118\\r\\nhis face in his hands. Much as he detested Filch, Harry\\r\\n*141*\\r\\ncouldn\\'t help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as\\r\\nhe felt for himself If Dumbledore believed Filch, he would be expelled\\r\\nfor sure.\\r\\nDumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and\\r\\ntapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but nothing happened: She\\r\\ncontinued to look as though she had been recently stuffed.\\r\\n\". . . I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou,\"\\r\\nsaid Lockhart, \"a series of attacks, the full story\\'s in my\\r\\nautobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with various\\r\\namulets, which cleared the matter up at once ......\\r\\nThe photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in\\r\\nagreement as he talked. One of them had forgotten to remove his hair\\r\\nnet.\\r\\nAt last Dumbledore straightened up.\\r\\n\"She\\'s not dead, Argus,\" he said softly.\\r\\nLockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of\\r\\nmurders he had prevented.\\r\\n\"Not dead?\" choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris.\\r\\n\"But why\\'s she all - all stiff and frozen?\"\\r\\n\"She has been Petrified,\" said Dumbledore (\"Ah! I thought so!\" said\\r\\nLockhart). \"But how, I cannot say . . . .\"\\r\\n\"Ask him!\" shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face to\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\n\"No second year could have done this,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"it\\r\\nwould take Dark Magic of the most advanced -\"\\r\\n\"He did it, he did it!\" Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling. \"You saw\\r\\nwhat he wrote on the wall! He found - in my office - he knows I\\'m a -\\r\\n119\\r\\nI\\'m a -\" Filch\\'s face worked horribly. \"He knows I\\'m a Squib!\" he\\r\\nfinished.\\r\\n142\\r\\n\"I never touched Mrs. Norris!\" Harry said loudly, uncomfortably\\r\\naware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the\\r\\nwalls. \"And I don\\'t even know what a Squib is.\"\\r\\n\"Rubbish!\" snarled Filch. \"He saw my Kwikspell letter!\"\\r\\n\"If I might speak, Headmaster,\" said Snape from the shadows, and\\r\\nHarry\\'s sense of forboding increased; he was sure nothing Snape had\\r\\nto say was going to do him any good.\\r\\n\"Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the\\r\\nwrong time,\" he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he\\r\\ndoubted it. \"But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here.\\r\\nWhy was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn\\'t he at the\\r\\nHalloween feast?\"\\r\\nHarry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the\\r\\ndeathday party. \". . . there were hundreds of ghosts, theyll tell you we were\\r\\nthere -\"\\r\\n\"But why not join the feast afterward?\" said Snape, his black eyes\\r\\nglittering in the candlelight. \"Why go up to that corridor?\"\\r\\nRon and Hermione looked at Harry.\\r\\n\"Because - because -\" Harry said, his heart thumping very fast;\\r\\nsomething told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he\\r\\nhad been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear,\\r\\n\"because we were tired and wanted to go to bed,\" he said.\\r\\n\"Without any supper?\" said Snape, a triumphant smile flickering across\\r\\nhis gaunt face. \"I didn\\'t think ghosts provided food fit for living people\\r\\nat their parties.\"\\r\\n\"We weren\\'t hungry,\" said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge\\r\\nrumble.\\r\\n120\\r\\nSnape\\'s nasty smile widened.\\r\\n*143*\\r\\n\"I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful,\" he\\r\\nsaid. \"It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges\\r\\nuntil he is ready to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should\\r\\nbe taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be\\r\\nhonest.\"\\r\\n\"Really, Severus,\" said Professor McGonagall sharply, \"I see no\\r\\nreason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn\\'t hit over the\\r\\nhead with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter has\\r\\ndone anything wrong.\"\\r\\nDumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His twinkling lightblue\\r\\ngaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed.\\r\\n\"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus,\" he said firmly.\\r\\nSnape looked furious. So did Filch.\\r\\n\"My cat has been Petrified!\" he shrieked, his eyes popping. \"I want to\\r\\nsee some punishment!\"\\r\\n\"We will be able to cure her, Argus,\" said Dumbledore patiently.\\r\\n\"Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As\\r\\nsoon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that\\r\\nwill revive Mrs. Norris.\"\\r\\n\"I\\'ll make it,\" Lockhart butted in. \"I must have done it a hundred times.\\r\\nI could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep -\"\\r\\n\"Excuse me,\" said Snape icily. \"But I believe I am the Potions master\\r\\nat this school.\"\\r\\nThere was a very awkward pause.\\r\\n\"You may go,\" Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\\r\\nThey went, as quickly as they could without actually running. When\\r\\nthey were a floor up from Lockhart\\'s office, they turned into\\r\\n121\\r\\n*144*\\r\\nan empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. Harry\\r\\nsquinted at his friends\\' darkened faces.\\r\\n\"D\\'you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Ron, without hesitation. \"Hearing voices no one else can\\r\\nhear isn\\'t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\"\\r\\nSomething in Ron\\'s voice made Harry ask, \"You do believe me, don\\'t\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\"\\'Course I do,\" said Ron quickly. \"But -you must admit it\\'s weird ......\\r\\n\"I know it\\'s weird,\" said Harry. \"The whole thing\\'s weird. What was\\r\\nthat writing on the wall about? The Cbamber Has Been Opened...\\r\\nWhat\\'s that supposed to mean?\"\\r\\n\"You know, it rings a sort of bell,\" said Ron slowly. \"I think someone\\r\\ntold me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once ... might\\'ve\\r\\nbeen Bill . . . .\"\\r\\n\"And what on earth\\'s a Squib?\" said Harry.\\r\\nTo his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger.\\r\\n\"Well - it\\'s not funny really - but as it\\'s Filch, he said. \"A Squib is\\r\\nsomeone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn\\'t got any\\r\\nmagic powers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but\\r\\nSquibs are quite unusual. If Filch\\'s trying to learn magic from a\\r\\nKwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would explain a lot.\\r\\nLike why he hates students so much.\" Ron gave a satisfied smile.\\r\\n\"He\\'s bitter.\"\\r\\nA clock chimed somewhere.\\r\\n\"Midnight,\" said Harry. \"We\\'d better get to bed before Snape comes\\r\\nalong and tries to frame us for something else.\"\\r\\n*145*\\r\\n122\\r\\nFor a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on\\r\\nMrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in everyone\\'s minds by pacing the spot\\r\\nwhere she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might\\r\\ncome back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall\\r\\nwith Mrs. Skower\\'s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no\\r\\neffect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When\\r\\nFilch wasn\\'t guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking redeyed\\r\\nthrough the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and\\r\\ntrying to put them in detention for things like \"breathing loudly\\' and\\r\\n\"looking happy.\"\\r\\nGinny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris\\'s fate.\\r\\nAccording to Ron, she was a great cat lover.\\r\\n\"But you haven\\'t really got to know Mrs. Norris,\" Ron told her\\r\\nbracingly. \"Honestly, we\\'re much better off without her.\" Ginny\\'s lip\\r\\ntrembled. \"Stuff like this doesn\\'t often happen at Hogwarts,\" Ron\\r\\nassured her. \"They\\'ll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of\\r\\nhere in no time. I just hope he\\'s got time to Petrify Filch before he\\'s\\r\\nexpelled. I\\'m only joking -\" Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched.\\r\\nThe attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was quite usual for\\r\\nHermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doing\\r\\nalmost nothing else. Nor could Harry and Ron get much response\\r\\nfrom her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the\\r\\nfollowing Wednesday did they find out.\\r\\nHarry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay\\r\\nbehind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, he\\r\\nwent upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch-\\r\\nFletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming\\r\\n*146*\\r\\ntoward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin\\r\\ncaught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite\\r\\ndirection.\\r\\nHarry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of\\r\\n123\\r\\nMagic homework. Professor Binns had asked for a threefoot-long\\r\\ncomposition on \"The Medieval Assembly of European\\r\\nWizards.\"\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe it, I\\'m still eight inches short said Ron fu\\r\\nriously, letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll.\\r\\n\"And Hermione\\'s done four feet seven inches and her writing\\'s\\r\\ntiny. \"\\r\\n\"Where is she?\" asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling\\r\\nhis own homework.\\r\\n\"Somewhere over there,\" said Ron, pointing along the shelves. \"Looking\\r\\nfor another book. I think she\\'s trying to read the whole library before\\r\\nChristmas.\"\\r\\nHarry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him.\\r\\n\"Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an idiot,\" said Ron,\\r\\nscribbling away, making his writing as large as possible. \"All that junk\\r\\nabout Lockhart being so great -\"\\r\\nHermione emerged from between the bookshelves. She looked irritable\\r\\nand at last seemed ready to talk to them.\\r\\n\"All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,\" she said,\\r\\nsitting down next to Harry and Ron. \"And there\\'s a two-week waiting\\r\\nlist. I wish I hadn\\'t left my copy at home, but I couldn\\'t fit it in my trunk\\r\\nwith all the Lockhart books.\"\\r\\n\"Why do you want it?\" said Harry.\\r\\n*141*\\r\\n\"The same reason everyone else wants it,\" said Hermione, \"to read\\r\\nup on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.\"\\r\\n\"What\\'s that?\" said Harry quickly.\\r\\n\"That\\'s just it. I can\\'t remember,\" said Hermione, biting her lip. \"And\\r\\nI can\\'t find the story anywhere else -\"\\r\\n124\\r\\n\"Hermione, let me read your composition,\" said Ron desperately,\\r\\nchecking his watch.\\r\\n\"No, I won\\'t,\" said Hermione, suddenly severe. \"You\\'ve had ten\\r\\ndays to finish it -\"\\r\\n\"I only need another two inches, come on -\"\\r\\nThe bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic,\\r\\nbickering.\\r\\nHistory of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. Professor\\r\\nBinns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most\\r\\nexciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the\\r\\nroom through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled, many people\\r\\nsaid he hadn\\'t noticed he was dead. He had simply got up to teach\\r\\none day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the\\r\\nstaff room fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since.\\r\\nToday was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened his notes and\\r\\nbegan to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly\\r\\neveryone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to\\r\\nlong enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again.\\r\\nHe had been speaking for half an hour when something happened\\r\\nthat had never happened before. Hermione put up her hand.\\r\\nProfessor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lec\\r\\n*148*\\r\\nture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed.\\r\\n\"Miss - er -?\"\\r\\n\"Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anything\\r\\nabout the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Hermione in a clear voice.\\r\\nDean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open,\\r\\ngazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown\\'s\\r\\nhead came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom\\'s elbow slipped\\r\\noff his desk.\\r\\n125\\r\\nProfessor Binns blinked.\\r\\n\"My subject is History of Magic,\" he said in his dry, wheezy voice. \"I\\r\\ndeal with facts, Miss Granger, not myths and legends.\" He cleared his\\r\\nthroat with a small noise like chalk s!-ping and continued, \"In\\r\\nSeptember of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers\\r\\n\"\\r\\nHe stuttered to a halt. Hermione\\'s hand was waving in the air again.\\r\\n\"Miss Grant?\"\\r\\n\"Please, sir, don\\'t legends always have a basis in fact?\"\\r\\nProfessor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, Harry was\\r\\nsure no student had ever interrupted him before, alive or dead.\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Professor Binns slowly, \"yes, one could argue that, I\\r\\nsuppose.\" He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a\\r\\nstudent properly before. \"However, the legend of which you speak is\\r\\nsuch a very sensational, even ludicrous tale -\"\\r\\nBut the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns\\'s every\\r\\nword. He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry\\r\\n*149*\\r\\ncould tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of\\r\\ninterest.\\r\\n\"Oh, very well,\" he said slowly. \"Let me see ... the Chamber of\\r\\nSecrets ...\\r\\n\"You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand\\r\\nyears ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches\\r\\nand wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after\\r\\nthem: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and\\r\\nSalazar Slytherin. They built this castle together, far from prying\\r\\nMuggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common\\r\\npeople, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.\"\\r\\n126\\r\\nHe paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.\\r\\n\"For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking\\r\\nout youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the\\r\\ncastle to be educated. But then disagreements sprang up between\\r\\nthem. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin\\r\\nwished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He\\r\\nbelieved that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.\\r\\nHe disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be\\r\\nuntrustworthy. After a while, there was a serious argument on the\\r\\nsubject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left the\\r\\nschool.\"\\r\\nProfessor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled\\r\\nold tortoise.\\r\\n\"Reliable historical sources tell us this much,\" he said. \"But these\\r\\nhonest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the\\r\\nChamber of Secrets. The story goes that Slytherin had built a\\r\\n*150*\\r\\nhidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew\\r\\nnothing.\\r\\n\"Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets\\r\\nso that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at\\r\\nthe school. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of\\r\\nSecrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of\\r\\nall who were unworthy to study magic.\"\\r\\nThere was silence as he finished telling the story, but it wasn\\'t the\\r\\nusual, sleepy silence that filled Professor Binns\\'s classes. There was\\r\\nunease in the air as everyone continued to watch him, hoping for\\r\\nmore. Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed.\\r\\n\"The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,\" he said. \"Naturally,\\r\\nthe school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, many\\r\\ntimes, by the most learned witches and wizards. It does not exist. A\\r\\ntale told to frighten the gullible.\"\\r\\n127\\r\\nHermione\\'s hand was back in the air.\\r\\n\"Sir - what exactly do you mean by the `horror within\\' the\\r\\nChamber?\"\\r\\n\"That is believed to be some sort of monster, which the Heir of\\r\\nSlytherin alone can control,\" said Professor Binns in his dry, reedy\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\nThe class exchanged nervous looks.\\r\\n\"I tell you, the thing does not exist,\" said Professor Binns, shuffling his\\r\\nnotes. \"There is no Chamber and no monster.\"\\r\\n\"But, sir,\" said Seamus Finnigan, \"if the Chamber can only be opened\\r\\nby Slytherin\\'s true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would\\r\\nthey?\"\\r\\n\"Nonsense, O\\'Flaherty,\" said Professor Binns in an aggravated\\r\\n*151*\\r\\ntone. \"If a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and\\r\\nheadmistresses haven\\'t found the thing -\"\\r\\n\"But, Professor,\" piped up Parvati Patil, \"you\\'d probably have to use\\r\\nDark Magic to open it -\"\\r\\n\"Just because a wizard doesn\\'t use Dark Magic doesn\\'t mean he\\r\\ncan\\'t, Miss Pennyfeather,\" snapped Professor Binns. \"I repeat, if the\\r\\nlikes of Dumbledore -\"\\r\\n\"But maybe you\\'ve got to be related to Slytherin, so Dumbledore\\r\\ncouldn\\'t -\" began Dean Thomas, but Professor Binns had had\\r\\nenough.\\r\\n\"That will do,\" he said sharply. \"It is a myth! It does not exist! There\\r\\nis not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a\\r\\nsecret broom cupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! We\\r\\nwill return, if you please, to history, to solid, believable, verifiable\\r\\nfact!\"\\r\\n128\\r\\nAnd within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor.\\r\\n\"I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,\" Ron told\\r\\nHarry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming\\r\\ncorridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before\\r\\ndinner. \"But I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t be in his house if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat\\r\\nhad tried to put me in Slytherin, I\\'d\\'ve got the train straight back\\r\\nhome ......\\r\\nHermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn\\'t say anything. His\\r\\nstomach had just dropped unpleasantly.\\r\\nHarry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat\\r\\n*152*\\r\\nhad seriously considered putting him in Slytherin. He could remember,\\r\\nas though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear\\r\\nwhen he\\'d placed the hat on his head a year before: You could be great,\\r\\nyou know, it\\'s all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the\\r\\nway to greatness, no doubt about that...\\r\\nBut Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House\\'s reputa\\r\\ntion for turning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, Not\\r\\nSlytherin! and the hat had said, Oh, well, if you\\'re sure ... better be\\r\\nGryffindor...\\r\\nAs they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevy went past.\\r\\n\"Hiya, Harry!\"\\r\\n\"Hullo, Colin,\" said Harry automatically.\\r\\n\"Harry - Harry - a boy in my class has been saying you\\'re\\r\\nBut Colin was so small he couldn~t fight against the tide of people\\r\\nbearing him toward the Great Hall; they heard him squeak, \"See you,\\r\\nHarry!\" and he was gone.\\r\\n\"What\\'s a boy in his class saying about you?\" Hermione wondered.\\r\\n129\\r\\n\"That I\\'m Slytherin\\'s heir, I expect,\" said Harry, his stomach dropping\\r\\nanother inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch-\\r\\nFletchley had run away from him at lunchtime.\\r\\n\"People here\\'ll believe anything,\" said Ron in disgust.\\r\\nThe crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase\\r\\nwithout difficulty.\\r\\n\"D\\'you really think there\\'s a Chamber of Secrets?\" Ron asked\\r\\nHermione.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" she said, frowning. \"Dumbledore couldn\\'t cure\\r\\n* 1,5 % *\\r\\nMrs. Norris, and that makes me think that whatever attacked her\\r\\nmight not be - well - human.\"\\r\\nAs she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the end\\r\\nof the very corridor where the attack had happened. They stopped\\r\\nand looked. The scene was just as it had been that night, except that\\r\\nthere was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an empty\\r\\nchair stood against the wall bearing the message \"The Chamber of\\r\\nSecrets has been Opened.\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s where Filch has been keeping guard,\" Ron muttered.\\r\\nThey looked at each other. The corridor was deserted.\\r\\n\"Can\\'t hurt to have a poke around,\" said Harry, dropping his bag and\\r\\ngetting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searching\\r\\nfor clues.\\r\\n\"Scorch marks!\" he said. \"Here - and here -\"\\r\\n\"Come and look at this!\" said Hermione. \"This is funny . . . .\"\\r\\nHarry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the\\r\\nwall. Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane, where around\\r\\ntwenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a\\r\\n130\\r\\nsmall crack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as though\\r\\nthey had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside.\\r\\n\"Have you ever seen spiders act like that?\" said Hermione\\r\\nwonderingly.\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry, \"have you, Ron? Ron?\"\\r\\nHe looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well back and seemed\\r\\nto be fighting the impulse to run.\\r\\n\"What\\'s up?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"I - don\\'t - like - spiders,\" said Ron tensely.\\r\\n\"I never knew that,\" said Hermione, looking at Ron in surprise.\\r\\n\"You\\'ve used spiders in Potions loads of times ......\\r\\n*154*\\r\\n\"I don\\'t mind them dead,\" said Ron, who was carefully looking\\r\\nanywhere but at the window. \"I just don\\'t like the way they move ....\\r\\nHermione giggled.\\r\\n\"It\\'s not funny,\" said Ron, fiercely. \"If you must know, when I was\\r\\nthree, Fred turned my - my teddy bear into a great big fiIthy spider\\r\\nbecause I broke his toy broomstick .... You wouldn\\'t like them either if\\r\\nyou\\'d been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and. .\\r\\n. \"\\r\\nHe broke off, shuddering. Hermione was obviously still trying not to\\r\\nlaugh. Feeling they had better get off the subject, Harry said,\\r\\n\"Remember all that water on the floor? Where did that come from?\\r\\nSomeone\\'s mopped it up.\"\\r\\n\"It was about here,\" said Ron, recovering himself to walk a few paces\\r\\npast Filch\\'s chair and pointing. \"Level with this door.\"\\r\\nHe reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as\\r\\nthough he\\'d been burned.\\r\\n131\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Can\\'t go in there,\" said Ron gruffly. \"That\\'s a girls\\' toilet.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, Ron, there won\\'t be anyone in there,\" said Hermione, standing up\\r\\nand coming over. \"That\\'s Moaning Myrtle\\'s place. Come on, let\\'s have\\r\\na look.\"\\r\\nAnd ignoring the large OUT of ORDER sign, she opened the door.\\r\\nIt was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set\\r\\nfoot in. Under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row of\\r\\nchipped sinks. The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given\\r\\noff by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders; the\\r\\nwooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of\\r\\nthem was dangling off its hinges.\\r\\n* -L 5,5\\r\\nHermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall.\\r\\nWhen she reached it she said, \"Hello, Myrtle, how are you?\"\\r\\nHarry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was floating above the\\r\\ntank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin.\\r\\n\"This is a girls\\' bathroom,\" she said, eyeing Ron and Harry suspiciously.\\r\\n\"They\\'re not girls.\"\\r\\n\"No,\" Hermione agreed. \"I just wanted to show them how er - nice it is\\r\\nin here.\"\\r\\nShe waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor.\\r\\n\"Ask her if she saw anything,\" Harry mouthed at Hermione.\\r\\n\"What are you whispering?\" said Myrtle, staring at him.\\r\\n\"Nothing,\" said Harry quickly. \"We wanted to ask -\"\\r\\n\"I wish people would stop talking behind my back!\" said Myrtle, in a\\r\\nvoice choked with tears. \"I do have feelings, you know, even if I am\\r\\ndead -\"\\r\\n132\\r\\n\"Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,\" said Hermione. \"Harry only -\"\\r\\n\"No one wants to upset me! That\\'s a good one!\" howled Myrtle. \"My\\r\\nlife was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along\\r\\nruining my death!\"\\r\\n\"We wanted to ask you if you\\'ve seen anything funny lately,\" said\\r\\nHermione quickly. \"Because a cat was attacked right outside your\\r\\nfront door on Halloween.\"\\r\\n\"Did you see anyone near here that night?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"I wasn\\'t paying attention,\" said Myrtle dramatically. \"Peeves upset me\\r\\nso much I came in here and tried to kill myself Then, of course, I\\r\\nremembered that I\\'m - that I\\'m \"\\r\\n\"Already dead,\" said Ron helpfully.\\r\\n* IL 56*\\r\\nMyrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived\\r\\nheadfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing\\r\\nfrom sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had\\r\\ncome to rest somewhere in the U-bend.\\r\\nHarry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shrugged\\r\\nwearily and said, \"Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle ....\\r\\nCome on, let\\'s go.\"\\r\\nHarry had barely closed the door on Myrtle\\'s gurgling sobs when a\\r\\nloud voice made all three of them jump.\\r\\n\"RON!\"\\r\\nPercy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefect\\r\\nbadge agleam, an expression of complete shock on his face.\\r\\n\"That\\'s a girls\\' bathroom!\" he gasped. \"What were you -?\"\\r\\n\"Just having a look around,\" Ron shrugged. \"Clues, you know -\"\\r\\n133\\r\\nPercy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry forcefully of Mrs.\\r\\nWeasley.\\r\\n\"Get - away - from - there -\" Perry said, striding toward them and\\r\\nstarting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. \"Don\\'t you care what\\r\\nthis looks like? Coming back here while everyone\\'s at dinner -\"\\r\\n\"Why shouldn\\'t we be here?\" said Ron hotly, stopping short and glaring\\r\\nat Percy. \"Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s what I told Ginny,\" said Percy fiercely, \"but she still seems to\\r\\nthink you\\'re going to be expelled, I\\'ve never seen her so upset, crying\\r\\nher eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly\\r\\noverexcited by this business -\"\\r\\n\"You don\\'t care about Ginny,\" said Ron, whose ears were now\\r\\n*157*\\r\\nreddening. \"You\\'re just worried I\\'m going to mess up your chances of\\r\\nbeing Head Boy -\"\\r\\n\"Five points from Gryffindor!\" Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect\\r\\nbadge. \"And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more detective work, or\\r\\nI\\'ll write to Mum!\"\\r\\nAnd he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron\\'s ears.\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy\\r\\nin the common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and\\r\\nkept blotting his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his\\r\\nwand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost\\r\\nas much as his homework, Ron slammed The Standard Book of Spells,\\r\\nGrade 2 shut. To Harry\\'s surprise, Hermione followed suit.\\r\\n\"Who can it be, though?\" she said in a quiet voice, as though\\r\\ncontinuing a conversation they had just been having. \"Who\\'d want to\\r\\nfrighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?\"\\r\\n\"Let\\'s think,\" said Ron in mock puzzlement. \"Who do we know who\\r\\nthinks Muggle-borns are scum?\"\\r\\n134\\r\\nHe looked at Hermione. Hermione looked back, unconvinced.\\r\\n\"If you\\'re talking about Malfoy -\"\\r\\n\"Of course I am!\" said Ron. \"You heard him - `You\\'ll be next,\\r\\nMudbloods!\\'- come on, you\\'ve only got to look at his foul rat face to\\r\\nknow it\\'s him -\"\\r\\n\"Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?\" said Hermione skeptically.\\r\\n\"Look at his family,\" said Harry, closing his books, too. \"The whole lot\\r\\nof them have been in Slytherin; he\\'s always boasting about it. They\\r\\ncould easily be Slytherin\\'s descendants. His father\\'s definitely evil\\r\\nenough.\"\\r\\n*158*\\r\\n\"They couldve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries!\"\\r\\nsaid Ron. \"Handing it down, father to son ......\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Hermione cautiously, \"I suppose it\\'s possible ......\\r\\n\"But how do we prove it?\" said Harry darkly.\\r\\n\"There might be a way,\" said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice still\\r\\nfurther with a quick glance across the room at Percy. \"Of course, it\\r\\nwould be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We\\'d be breaking\\r\\nabout fifty school rules, I expect -\"\\r\\n\"If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know,\\r\\nwon\\'t you?\" said Ron irritably.\\r\\n\"All right,\" said Hermione coldly. \"What we\\'d need to do is to get\\r\\ninside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions\\r\\nwithout him realizing it\\'s us.\"\\r\\n\"But that\\'s impossible,\" Harry said as Ron laughed.\\r\\n\"No, it\\'s not,\" said Hermione. \"All we\\'d need would be some Polyjuice\\r\\nPotion.\"\\r\\n\"What\\'s that?\" said Ron and Harry together.\\r\\n135\\r\\n\"Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago -\"\\r\\n\"D\\'you think we\\'ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to\\r\\nSnape?\" muttered Ron.\\r\\n\"It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could\\r\\nchange into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us.\\r\\nMalfoy would probably tell us anything. He\\'s probably boasting about it\\r\\nin the Slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him.\"\\r\\n\"This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,\" said Ron, frowning.\\r\\n\"What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?\"\\r\\n\"It wears off after a while,\" said Hermione, waving her hand\\r\\n*159*\\r\\nimpatiently. \"But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult.\\r\\nSnape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it\\'s\\r\\nbound to be in the Restricted Section of the library.\"\\r\\nThere was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted\\r\\nSection: You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher.\\r\\n\"Hard to see why we\\'d want the book, really,\" said Ron, \"if we\\r\\nweren\\'t going to try and make one of the potions.\"\\r\\n\"I think,\" said Hermione, \"that if we made it sound as though\\r\\nwe were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance ......\\r\\n\"Oh, come on, no teacher\\'s going to fall for that,\" said Ron.\\r\\n\"They\\'d have to be really thick . . . .\"\\r\\nC H-H A P T V It T 1\\' N\\r\\nTHE ROGUE BLUDGER\\r\\nince the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart had not\\r\\nbrought live creatures to class. Instead, he read passages from his\\r\\nbooks to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic\\r\\nbits. He usually picked Harry to help him with these reconstructions;\\r\\nso far, Harry had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager\\r\\nwhom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head\\r\\ncold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except\\r\\nlettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him.\\r\\n136\\r\\nHarry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next\\r\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf If\\r\\nhe hadn\\'t had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good\\r\\nmood, he would have refused to do it.\\r\\n\"Nice loud howl, Harry - exactly - and then, if you\\'ll believe it, I\\r\\npounced - like this - slammed him to the floor - thus with one hand, I\\r\\nmanaged to hold him down - with my other, I\\r\\n*161*\\r\\nput my wand to his throat -I then screwed up my remaining strength\\r\\nand performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm - he let\\r\\nout a piteous moan - go on, Harry - higher than that - good - the fur\\r\\nvanished - the fangs shrank - and he turned back into a man. Simple,\\r\\nyet effective - and another village will remember me forever as the\\r\\nhero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf\\r\\nattacks.\"\\r\\nThe bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet.\\r\\n\"Homework - compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga\\r\\nWagga Werewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the\\r\\nbest one!\"\\r\\nThe class began to leave. Harry returned to the back of the room,\\r\\nwhere Ron and Hermione were waiting.\\r\\n\"Ready?\" Harry muttered.\\r\\n\"Wait till everyone\\'s gone,\" said Hermione nervously. \"All right . . . \"\\r\\nShe approached Lockhart\\'s desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in\\r\\nher hand, Harry and Ron right behind her.\\r\\n\"Er - Professor Lockhart?\" Hermione stammered. \"I wanted to - to\\r\\nget this book out of the library. Just for background reading.\" She\\r\\nheld out the piece of paper, her hand shaking slightly. \"But the thing\\r\\nis, it\\'s in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to\\r\\n137\\r\\nsign for it - I\\'m sure it would help me understand what you say in\\r\\nGadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms\\r\\n\"Ah, Gadding with Ghouls!\" said Lockhart, taking the note from\\r\\nHermione and smiling widely at her. \"Possibly my very favorite\\r\\nbook. You enjoyed it?\"\\r\\n-162\\r\\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Hermione eagerly. \"So clever, the way you trapped that\\r\\nlast one with the tea-strainer -\"\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'m sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year\\r\\na little extra help,\" said Lockhart warmly, and he pulled out an\\r\\nenormous peacock quill. \"Yes, nice, isn\\'t it?\" he said, misreading the\\r\\nrevolted look on Ron\\'s face. \"I usually save it for book-signings.\"\\r\\nHe scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it\\r\\nback to Hermione.\\r\\n\"So, Harry,\" said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the note with\\r\\nfumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag. \"Tomorrow\\'s the first\\r\\nQuidditch match of the season, I believe? Gryffindor against Slytherin,\\r\\nis it not? I hear you\\'re a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. I was\\r\\nasked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life\\r\\nto the eradication of the Dark Forces. Still, if ever you feel the need\\r\\nfor a little private training, don\\'t hesitate to ask. Always happy to pass\\r\\non my expertise to less able players ......\\r\\nHarry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after\\r\\nRon and Hermione.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe it,\" he said as the three of them examined the signature\\r\\non the note. \"He didn\\'t even look at the book we wanted.\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s because he\\'s a brainless git,\" said Ron. \"But who cares, we\\'ve\\r\\ngot what we needed -\"\\r\\n\"He is not a brainless git,\" said Hermione shrilly as they half ran\\r\\ntoward the library.\\r\\n\"Just because he said you were the best student of the year -\"\\r\\n138\\r\\nThey dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the\\r\\nlibrary. Madam Pince, the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman who\\r\\nlooked like an underfed vulture.\\r\\n*163*\\r\\n\"Moste Potente Potions?\" she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the\\r\\nnote from Hermione; but Hermione wouldn\\'t let go.\\r\\n\"I was wondering if I could keep it,\" she said breathlessly.\\r\\n\"Oh, come on,\" said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it\\r\\nat Madam Pince. \"We\\'ll get you another autograph. Lockhart\\'ll sign\\r\\nanything if it stands still long enough.\"\\r\\nMadam Pince held the note up to the light, as though determined to\\r\\ndetect a forgery, but it passed the test. She stalked away between the\\r\\nlofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and\\r\\nmoldy-looking book. Hermione put it carefully into her bag and they\\r\\nleft, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty.\\r\\nFive minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle\\'s out-oforder\\r\\nbathroom once again. Hermione had overridden Ron\\'s objections\\r\\nby pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds\\r\\nwould go, so they were guaranteed some privacy. Moaning Myrtle\\r\\nwas crying noisily in her stall, but they were ignoring her, and she\\r\\nthem.\\r\\nHermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and the three of\\r\\nthem bent over the damp-spotted pages. It was clear from a glance\\r\\nwhy it belonged in the Restricted Section. Some of the potions had\\r\\neffects almost too gruesome to think about, and there were some very\\r\\nunpleasant illustrations, which included a man who seemed to have\\r\\nbeen turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of\\r\\narms out of her head.\\r\\n\"Here it is,\" said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed The\\r\\nPolyjuice Potion. It was decorated with drawings of people halfway\\r\\nthrough transforming into other people. Harry sin\\r\\n*164*\\r\\n139\\r\\ncerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their\\r\\nfaces.\\r\\n\"This is the most complicated potion I\\'ve ever seen,\" said Hermione as\\r\\nthey scanned the recipe. \"Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and\\r\\nknotgrass,\" she murmured, running her finger down the list of\\r\\ningredients. \"Well, they\\'re easy enough, they\\'re in the student storecupboard,\\r\\nwe can help ourselves .... Oooh, look, powdered horn of a\\r\\nbicorn - don\\'t know where we\\'re going to get that - shredded skin of a\\r\\nboomslang -. that\\'ll be tricky, too and of course a bit of whoever we\\r\\nwant to change into.\"\\r\\n\"Excuse me?\" said Ron sharply. \"What d\\'you mean, a bit of whoever\\r\\nwe\\'re changing into? I\\'m drinking nothing with Crabbe\\'s toenails in it -\"\\r\\nHermione continued as though she hadn\\'t heard him.\\r\\n\"We don\\'t have to worry about that yet, though, because we add those\\r\\nbits last ......\\r\\nRon turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another worry.\\r\\n\"D\\'you realize how much we\\'re going to have to steal, Hermione?\\r\\nShredded skin of a boomslang, that\\'s definitely not in the students\\'\\r\\ncupboard. What\\'re we going to do, break into Snape\\'s private stores? I\\r\\ndon\\'t know if this is a good idea ......\\r\\nHermione shut the book with a snap.\\r\\n\"Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,\" she said. There were\\r\\nbright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than\\r\\nusual. \"I don\\'t want to break rules, you know. I think threatening\\r\\nMuggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if\\r\\nyou don\\'t want to find out if it\\'s Malfoy, I\\'ll go straight to Madam Pince\\r\\nnow and hand the book back in =\\'\\r\\n*165\\r\\n\"I never thought Id see the day when you\\'d be persuading us to\\r\\nbreak rules,\" said Ron. \"All right, we\\'ll do it. But not toenails, okay?\"\\r\\n140\\r\\n\"How long will it take to make, anyway?\" said Harry as Hermione,\\r\\nlooking happier, opened the book again.\\r\\n\"Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and\\r\\nthe lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days ... I\\'d say\\r\\nit\\'d be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients.\"\\r\\n\"A month?\" said Ron. \"Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggleborns\\r\\nin the school by then!\" But Hermione\\'s eyes narrowed\\r\\ndangerously again, and he added swiftly, \"But it\\'s the best plan we\\'ve\\r\\ngot, so full steam ahead, I say.\"\\r\\nHowever, while Hermione was checking that the coast was clear for\\r\\nthem to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, \"It\\'ll be a lot less\\r\\nhassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow.\\r\\nHarry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking\\r\\nabout the coming Quidditch match. He was nervous, mainly at the\\r\\nthought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the\\r\\nidea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold\\r\\ncould buy. He had never wanted to beat Slytherin so badly. After\\r\\nhalf an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got up,\\r\\ndressed, and went down to breakfast early, where he found the rest\\r\\nof the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all looking\\r\\nuptight and not speaking much.\\r\\nAs eleven o\\'clock approached, the whole school started to make its\\r\\nway down to the Quidditch stadium. It was a muggy sort of day\\r\\n*166*\\r\\nwith a hint of thunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurrying\\r\\nover to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms. The\\r\\nteam pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to\\r\\nWood\\'s usual pre-match pep talk.\\r\\n\"Slytherin has better brooms than us,\" he began. \"No point denying it.\\r\\nBut we\\'ve got better people on our brooms. We\\'ve trained harder than\\r\\nthey have, we\\'ve been flying in all weathers -\" (\"Too true,\" muttered\\r\\nGeorge Weasley. \"I haven\\'t been properly dry since August\") \"- and\\r\\nwe\\'re going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime,\\r\\nMalfoy, buy his way onto their team.\"\\r\\n141\\r\\nChest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry.\\r\\n\"It\\'ll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a Seeker has to have\\r\\nsomething more than a rich father. Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or\\r\\ndie trying, Harry, because we\\'ve got to win today, we\\'ve got to.\"\\r\\n\"So no pressure, Harry\" said Fred, winking at him.\\r\\nAs they walked out onto the pitch, a roar of noise greeted them; mainly\\r\\ncheers, because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to see\\r\\nSlytherin beaten, but the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and\\r\\nhisses heard, too. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch teacher, asked Flint\\r\\nand Wood to shake hands, which they did, giving each other\\r\\nthreatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary.\\r\\n\"On my whistle,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Three ... two ... one. . .\\r\\nWith a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteen\\r\\nplayers rose toward the leaden sky. Harry flew higher than any of\\r\\nthem, squinting around for the Snitch.\\r\\n*167*\\r\\n\"All right there, Scarhead?\" yelled Malfoy, shooting underneath him as\\r\\nthough to show off the speed of his broom.\\r\\nHarry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a heavy black\\r\\nBludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that he\\r\\nfelt it ruffle his hair as it passed.\\r\\n\"Close one, Harry!\" said George, streaking past him with his club in his\\r\\nhand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin. Harry saw\\r\\nGeorge give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian\\r\\nPucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight\\r\\nfor Harry again.\\r\\nHarry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hard\\r\\ntoward Malfoy. Once again, the Bludger swerved like a boomerang\\r\\nand shot at Harry\\'s head.\\r\\nHarry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the\\r\\n142\\r\\npitch. He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him. What\\r\\nwas going on? Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it\\r\\nwas their job to try and unseat as many people as possible ....\\r\\nFred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end. Harry\\r\\nducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might; the Bludger\\r\\nwas knocked off course.\\r\\n\"Gotcha!\" Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it was\\r\\nmagnetically attracted to Harry, the Bludger pelted after him once\\r\\nmore and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed.\\r\\nIt had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face,\\r\\nsplattering onto his glasses. He didn\\'t have a clue what was going on\\r\\nin the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan, who was\\r\\ncommentating, say, \"Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero =\\'\\r\\n*168*\\r\\nThe Slytherins\\' superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and\\r\\nmeanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry\\r\\nout of the air. Fred and George were now flying so close to him on\\r\\neither side that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms\\r\\nand had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it.\\r\\n\"Someone\\'s - tampered - with - this - Bludger -\" Fred grunted,\\r\\nswinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\n\"We need time out,\" said George, trying to signal to Wood and stop\\r\\nthe Bludger breaking Harry\\'s nose at the same time.\\r\\nWood had obviously got the message. Madam Hooch\\'s whistle rang\\r\\nout and Harry, Fred, and George dived for the ground, still trying to\\r\\navoid the mad Bludger.\\r\\n\"What\\'s going on?\" said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled\\r\\ntogether, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered. \"We\\'re being\\r\\nflattened. Fred, George, where were you when that Bludger stopped\\r\\nAngelina scoring?\"\\r\\n\"We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other Bludger from\\r\\n143\\r\\nmurdering Harry, Oliver,\" said George angrily. \"Someone\\'s fixed it -\\r\\nit won\\'t leave Harry alone. It hasn\\'t gone for anyone else all game.\\r\\nThe Slytherins must have done something to it.\"\\r\\n\"But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch\\'s office since\\r\\nour last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then . . . . \"\\r\\nsaid Wood, anxiously.\\r\\nMadam Hooch was walking toward them. Over her shoulder, Harry\\r\\ncould see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction.\\r\\n169\\r\\n\"Listen,\" said Harry as she came nearer and nearer, \"with you two\\r\\nflying around me all the time the only way I\\'m going to catch the\\r\\nSnitch is if it flies up my sleeve. Go back to the rest of the team and\\r\\nlet me deal with the rogue one.\"\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be thick,\" said Fred. \"It\\'ll take your head off.\"\\r\\nWood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys.\\r\\n(I Oliver, this is insane,\" said Alicia Spinner angrily. \"You can\\'t let Harry\\r\\ndeal with that thing on his own. Let\\'s ask for an inquiry -))\\r\\n\"If we stop now, we\\'ll have to forfeit the match!\" said Harry. \"And\\r\\nwe\\'re not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger! Come\\r\\non, Oliver, tell them to leave me alone!\"\\r\\n\"This is all your fault,\" George said angrily to Wood. \" `Get the Snitch\\r\\nor die trying,\\' what a stupid thing to tell him -\"\\r\\nMadam Hooch had joined them.\\r\\n\"Ready to resume play?\" she asked Wood.\\r\\nWood looked at the determined look on Harry\\'s face.\\r\\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Fred, George, you heard Harry -leave him alone\\r\\nand let him deal with the Bludger on his own.\"\\r\\nThe rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam Hooch\\'s whistle,\\r\\n144\\r\\nHarry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the\\r\\nBludger behind him. Higher and higher Harry climbed; he looped and\\r\\nswooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless\\r\\nkept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his\\r\\nnostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the\\r\\nBludger. He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must\\r\\nlook very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn\\'t change\\r\\ndirection as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster\\r\\nride around the\\r\\n*170*\\r\\nedges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the\\r\\nGryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past\\r\\nWood\\r\\nA whistling in Harry\\'s ear told him the Bludger had just missed him\\r\\nagain; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.\\r\\n\"Training for the ballet, Potter?\" yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to\\r\\ndo a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the\\r\\nBludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at\\r\\nMalfoy in hatred, he saw it - the Golden Snitch. It was hovering inches\\r\\nabove Malfoy\\'s left ear - and Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn\\'t\\r\\nseen it.\\r\\nFor an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not daring to speed\\r\\ntoward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch.\\r\\nWHAM.\\r\\nHe had stayed still a second too long. The Bludger had hit him at last,\\r\\nsmashed into his elbow, and Harry felt his arm break. Dimly, dazed by\\r\\nthe searing pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain-drenched\\r\\nbroom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless at\\r\\nhis side - the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this time\\r\\nW-ming at his face - Harry swerved out of the way, one idea firmly\\r\\nlodged in his numb brain: get to Malfoy.\\r\\nThrough a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, sneering\\r\\nface below him and saw its eyes widen with fear: Malfoy thought\\r\\nHarry was attacking him.\\r\\n145\\r\\n\"What the -\" he gasped, careening out of Harry\\'s way.\\r\\nHarry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch;\\r\\nhe felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only\\r\\n*171*\\r\\ngripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd\\r\\nbelow as he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass\\r\\nout.\\r\\nWith a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom. His\\r\\narm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, he heard,\\r\\nas though from a distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. He\\r\\nfocused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand.\\r\\n\"Aha,\" he said vaguely. \"We\\'ve won.\"\\r\\nAnd he fainted.\\r\\nHe came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with\\r\\nsomeone leaning over him. He saw a glitter of teeth.\\r\\n\"Oh, no, not you,\" he moaned.\\r\\n\"Doesn\\'t know what he\\'s saying,\" said Lockhart loudly to the anxious\\r\\ncrowd of Gryffindors pressing around them. \"Not to worry, Harry.\\r\\nI\\'m about to fix your arm.\"\\r\\n\"No!\"said Harry. \"I\\'ll keep it like this, thanks ......\\r\\nHe tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard a familiar\\r\\nclicking noise nearby.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want a photo of this, Colin,\" he said loudly.\\r\\n\"Lie back, Harry,\" said Lockhart soothingly. \"It\\'s a simple charm I\\'ve\\r\\nused countless times -\"\\r\\n\"Why can\\'t I just go to the hospital wing?\" said Harry through\\r\\nclenched teeth.\\r\\n146\\r\\n\"He should really, Professor,\" said a muddy Wood, who couldn\\'t\\r\\nhelp grinning even though his Seeker was injured. \"Great capture,\\r\\nHarry, really spectacular, your best yet, Id say -\"\\r\\nThrough the thicket of legs around him, Harry spotted Fred and\\r\\n*112*\\r\\nGeorge Weasley, wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box. It was still\\r\\nputting up a terrific fight.\\r\\n\"Stand back,\" said Lockhart, who was rolling up his jade-green\\r\\nsleeves.\\r\\n\"No - don\\'t -\" said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was twirling his wand\\r\\nand a second later had directed it straight at Harry\\'s arm.\\r\\nA strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry\\'s shoulder and\\r\\nspread all the way down to his fingertips. It felt as though his arm was\\r\\nbeing deflated. He didn\\'t dare look at what was happening. He had\\r\\nshut his eyes, his face turned away from his arm, but his worst fears\\r\\nwere realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creevey\\r\\nbegan clicking away madly. His arm didn\\'t hurt anymore - nor did it\\r\\nfeel remotely like an arm.\\r\\n\"Ah,\" said Lockhart. \"Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. But the\\r\\npoint is, the bones are no longer broken. That\\'s the thing to bear in\\r\\nmind. So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah, Mr. Weasley,\\r\\nMiss Granger, would you escort him? - and Madam Pomfrey will be\\r\\nable to - er - tidy you up a bit.\"\\r\\nAs Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deep\\r\\nbreath he looked down at his right side. What he saw nearly made him\\r\\npass out again.\\r\\nPoking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, fleshcolored\\r\\nrubber glove. He tried to move his fingers. Nothing happened.\\r\\nLockhart hadn\\'t mended Harry\\'s bones. He had removed them.\\r\\nMadam Pomfrey wasn\\'t at all pleased.\\r\\n147\\r\\n\"You should have come straight to me!\" she raged, holding up\\r\\n*173*\\r\\nthe sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a\\r\\nworking arm. \"I can mend bones in a second - but growing them back -\\r\\n\"\\r\\n\"You will be able to, won\\'t you?\" said Harry desperately.\\r\\n\"I\\'ll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,\" said Madam Pomfrey\\r\\ngrimly, throwing Harry a pair of pajamas. \"You\\'ll have to stay the\\r\\nnight ......\\r\\nHermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry\\'s bed while\\r\\nRon helped him into his pajamas. It took a while to stuff the rubbery,\\r\\nboneless arm into a sleeve.\\r\\n\"How can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione, eh?\" Ron called\\r\\nthrough the curtain as he pulled Harry\\'s limp fingers through the cuff.\\r\\n\"If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked.\"\\r\\n\"Anyone can make a mistake,\" said Hermione. \"And it doesn\\'t hurt\\r\\nanymore, does it, Harry?\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry, getting into bed. \"But it doesn\\'t do anything else\\r\\neither.\"\\r\\nAs he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly.\\r\\nHermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain. Madam\\r\\nPomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro.\\r\\n\"You\\'re in for a rough night,\" she said, pouring out a steaming\\r\\nbeakerful and handing it to him. \"Regrowing bones is a nasty business.\\r\\nSo was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry\\'s mouth and throat as it\\r\\nwent down, making him cough and splutter. Still tut-tutting about\\r\\ndangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey re\\r\\n*114*\\r\\n148\\r\\ntreated, leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some\\r\\nwater.\\r\\n\"We won, though,\" said Ron, a grin breaking across his face.\\r\\n\"That was some catch you made. Malfoy\\'s face ... he looked ready\\r\\nto kill ......\\r\\n\"I want to know how he fixed that Bludger,\" said Hermione\\r\\ndarkly.\\r\\n\"We can add that to the list of questions we\\'ll ask him when\\r\\nwe\\'ve taken the Polyjuice Potion,\" said Harry, sinking back onto\\r\\nhis pillows. \"I hope it tastes better than this stuff .....\\r\\n\"If it\\'s got bits of Slytherins in it? You\\'ve got to be joking,\" said\\r\\nRon.\\r\\nThe door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment. Filthy\\r\\nand soaking wet, the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\n\"Unbelievable flying, Harry,\" said George. \"I\\'ve just seen Mar\\r\\ncus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Something about having the Snitch on\\r\\ntop of his head and not noticing. Malfoy didn\\'t seem too happy.\"\\r\\nThey had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice;\\r\\nthey gathered around Harry\\'s bed and were just getting started on\\r\\nwhat promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came\\r\\nstorming over, shouting, \"This boy needs rest, he\\'s got thirty-three\\r\\nbones to regrow! Out! OUT!\"\\r\\nAnd Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him from the\\r\\nstabbing pains in his limp arm.\\r\\nHours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch\\r\\nblackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His arm now felt full of\\r\\nlarge splinters. For a second, he thought that was what had woken\\r\\nhim. Then, with a thrill of horror, he realized that someone was\\r\\nsponging his forehead in the dark.\\r\\n\"Get off!\" he said loudly, and then, \"Dobby!\"\\r\\nThe house-elf\\'s goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry\\r\\nthrough the darkness. A single tear was running down his long,\\r\\npointed nose.\\r\\n\"Harry Potter came back to school,\" he whispered miserably.\\r\\n149\\r\\n\"Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter. Ah sir, why didn\\'t you\\r\\nheed Dobby? Why didn\\'t Harry Potter go back home when he\\r\\nmissed the train?\"\\r\\nHarry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby\\'s sponge\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\"What\\'re you doing here?\" he said. \"And how did you know I missed\\r\\nthe train?\"\\r\\nDobby\\'s lip trembled and Harry was seized by a sudden suspicion.\\r\\n\"It was you!\" he said slowly. \"You stopped the barrier from letting us\\r\\nthrough!\"\\r\\n\"Indeed yes, sir,\" said Dobby, nodding his head vigorously, ears\\r\\nflapping. \"Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the\\r\\ngateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward\" - he showed\\r\\nHarry ten long, bandaged fingers - \"but Dobby didn\\'t care, sir, for he\\r\\nthought Harry Potter was safe, and never did Dobby dream that Harry\\r\\nPotter would get to school another way!\"\\r\\nHe was rocking backward and forward, shaking his ugly head.\\r\\n\"Dobby was \\'so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at\\r\\nHogwarts, he let his master\\'s dinner burn! Such a flogging Dobby\\r\\nnever had, sir . .....\\r\\n*176*\\r\\nHarry slumped back onto his pillows.\\r\\n\"You nearly got Ron and me expelled,\" he said fiercely. \"You\\'d better\\r\\nget lost before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you.\"\\r\\nDobby smiled weakly.\\r\\n\"Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day\\r\\nat home.\"\\r\\nHe blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore, looking\\r\\nso pathetic that Harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself.\\r\\n150\\r\\n\"Why d\\'you wear that thing, Dobby?\" he asked curiously.\\r\\n\"This, sir?\" said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase. \"\\'Tis a mark of the\\r\\nhouse-elf\\'s enslavement, sir. Dobby can only be freed if his masters\\r\\npresent him with clothes, sir. The family is careful not to pass Dobby\\r\\neven a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house\\r\\nforever.\"\\r\\nDobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly, \"Harry Potter must\\r\\ngo home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make -\"\\r\\n\"Your Bludger?\" said Harry, anger rising once more. \"What d\\'you\\r\\nmean, your Bludger? You made that Bludger try and kill me?\"\\r\\n\"Not kill you, sir, never kill you!\" said Dobby, shocked. \"Dobby wants\\r\\nto save Harry Potter\\'s life! Better sent home, grievously injured, than\\r\\nremain here sir! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to be\\r\\nsent home!\"\\r\\n\"Oh, is that all?\" said Harry angrily. \"I don\\'t suppose you\\'re going to\\r\\ntell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces?\"\\r\\n\"Ah, if Harry Potter only knew!\" Dobby groaned, more tears dripping\\r\\nonto his ragged pillowcase. \"If he knew what he means\\r\\n*177*\\r\\nto us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we dregs of the magical world!\\r\\nDobby remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\\r\\nwas at the height of his powers, sir! We house-elfs were treated like\\r\\nvermin, sir! Of course, Dobby is still treated like that, sir,\" he admitted,\\r\\ndrying his face on the pillowcase. \"But mostly, sir, life has improved\\r\\nfor my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.\\r\\nHarry Potter survived, and the Dark Lord\\'s power was broken, and it\\r\\nwas a new dawn, sir, and Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope\\r\\nfor those of us who thought the Dark days would never end, sit... And\\r\\nnow, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to happen, are perhaps happening\\r\\nalready, and Dobby cannot let Harry Potter stay here now that history\\r\\nis to repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once more\\r\\nDobby froze, horrorstruck, then grabbed Harry\\'s water jug from his\\r\\n151\\r\\nbedside table and cracked it over his own head, toppling out of sight. A\\r\\nsecond later, he crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering,\\r\\n\"Bad Dobby, very bad Dobby. . .\"\\r\\n\"So there is a Chamber of Secrets?\" Harry whispered. \"And did you\\r\\nsay it\\'s been opened before? Tell me, Dobby!\"\\r\\nHe seized the elf\\'s bony wrist as Dobby\\'s hand inched toward the\\r\\nwater jug. \"But I\\'m not Muggle-born - how can I be in danger from the\\r\\nChamber?\"\\r\\n\"Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby,\" stammered the elf,\\r\\nhis eyes huge in the dark. \"Dark deeds are planned in this place, but\\r\\nHarry Potter must not be here when they happen - go home, Harry\\r\\nPotter, go home. Harry Potter must not meddle in this, sir, \\'tis too\\r\\ndangerous -\"\\r\\n\"Who is it, Dobby?\" Harry said, keeping a firm hold on Dobby\\'s\\r\\n*178*\\r\\nwrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again. \"Who\\'s\\r\\nopened it? Who opened it last time?\"\\r\\n\"Dobby can\\'t, sir, Dobby can\\'t, Dobby mustn\\'t tell!\" squealed the elf.\\r\\n\"Go home, Harry Potter, go home!\"\\r\\n\"I\\'m not going anywhere!\" said Harry fiercely. \"One of my best\\r\\nfriends is Muggle-born; she\\'ll be first in line if the Chamber really has\\r\\nbeen opened -\"\\r\\n\"Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends!\" moaned Dobby in a\\r\\nkind of miserable ecstasy. \"So noble! So valiant! But he must save\\r\\nhimself, he must, Harry Potter must not -\"\\r\\nDobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Harry heard it, too.\\r\\nThere were footsteps coming down the passageway outside.\\r\\n\"Dobby must go!\" breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud crack,\\r\\nand Harry\\'s fist was suddenly clenched on thin air. He slumped back\\r\\ninto bed, his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the\\r\\nfootsteps drew nearer.\\r\\n152\\r\\nNext moment, Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing a\\r\\nlong woolly dressing gown and a nightcap. He was carrying one end\\r\\nof what looked like a statue. Professor McGonagall appeared a\\r\\nsecond later, carrying its feet. Together, they heaved it onto a bed.\\r\\n\"Get Madam Pomfrey,\" whispered Dumbledore, and Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall hurried past the end of Harry\\'s bed out of sight. Harry lay\\r\\nquite still, pretending to be asleep. He heard urgent voices, and then\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall swept back into view, closely followed by\\r\\nMadam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress.\\r\\nHe heard a sharp intake of breath.\\r\\n\"What happened?\" Madam Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore,\\r\\nbending over the statue on the bed.\\r\\n*l79*\\r\\n\"Another attack,\" said Dumbledore. \"Minerva found him on the stairs.\\r\\n\"There was a bunch of grapes next to him,\" said Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall. \"We think he was trying to sneak up here to visit Potter.\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and carefully, he raised\\r\\nhimself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed. A ray\\r\\nof moonlight lay across its staring face.\\r\\nIt was Colin Creevey. His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck\\r\\nup in front of him, holding his camera.\\r\\n\"Petrified?\" whispered Madam Pomfrey.\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"But I shudder to think ... If Albus\\r\\nhadn\\'t been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate - who knows\\r\\nwhat might have -\"\\r\\nThe three of them stared down at Colin. Then Dumbledore leaned\\r\\nforward and wrenched the camera out of Colin\\'s rigid grip.\\r\\n\"You don\\'t think he managed to get a picture of his attacker?\" said\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall eagerly.\\r\\n153\\r\\nDumbledore didn\\'t answer. He opened the back of the camera.\\r\\n\"Good gracious!\" said Madam Pomfrey.\\r\\nA jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. Harry, three beds away,\\r\\ncaught the acrid smell of burnt plastic.\\r\\n\"Melted,\" said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly. \"All melted...\"\\r\\n\"What does this mean, Albus?\" Professor McGonagall asked\\r\\nurgently.\\r\\n\"It means,\" said Dumbledore, \"that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed\\r\\nopen again.\"\\r\\nMadam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth. Professor McGonagall\\r\\nstared at Dumbledore.\\r\\n*180*\\r\\n\"But, Albus ... surely ... who?\"\\r\\n\"The question is not who,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes on Colin.\\r\\n\"The question is, how . . . .\"\\r\\nAnd from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall\\'s shad\\r\\nowy face, she didn\\'t understand this any better than he did.\\r\\nC H-H A P T t R ELEVEN\\r\\nTHE D-KJEL]ING C-L-IJIB\\r\\nHarry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with\\r\\nwinter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff. He sat up quickly\\r\\nand looked over at Colin\\'s bed, but it had been blocked from view by\\r\\nthe high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday. Seeing that he\\r\\nwas awake, Madam Pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray\\r\\nand then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers.\\r\\n\"All in order,\" she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge lefthanded.\\r\\n\"When you\\'ve finished eating, you may leave.\"\\r\\nHarry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor\\r\\nTower, desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby,\\r\\n154\\r\\nbut they weren\\'t there. Harry left to look for them, wondering where\\r\\nthey could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren\\'t\\r\\ninterested in whether he had his bones back or not.\\r\\n*182*\\r\\nAs Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled out of it,\\r\\nlooking in far better spirits than last time they\\'d met.\\r\\n\"Oh, hello, Harry,\" he said. \"Excellent flying yesterday, really\\r\\nexcellent. Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup you\\r\\nearned fifty points!\"\\r\\n\"You haven\\'t seen Ron or Hermione, have you?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"No, I haven\\'t,\" said Percy, his smile fading. \"I hope Ron\\'s not in\\r\\nanother girls\\' toilet .....\\r\\nHarry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then\\r\\nheaded straight for Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. He couldn\\'t see why\\r\\nRon and Hermione would be in there again, but after making sure\\r\\nthat neither Filch nor any prefects were around, he opened the door\\r\\nand heard their voices coming from a locked stall.\\r\\n\"It\\'s me,\" he said, closing the door behind him. There was a clunk, a\\r\\nsplash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione\\'s eye\\r\\npeering through the keyhole.\\r\\n`Harry!\" she said. \"You gave us such a fright - come in how\\'s your\\r\\narm?\"\\r\\n\"Fine,\" said Harry, squeezing into the stall. An old cauldron was\\r\\nperched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told Harry\\r\\nthey had lit a fire beneath it. Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires\\r\\nwas a speciality of Hermione\\'s.\\r\\n\"We\\'d\\'ve come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the\\r\\nPolyjuice Potion,\" Ron explained as Harry, with difficulty, locked the\\r\\nstall again. \"We\\'ve decided this is the safest place to hide it.\"\\r\\n155\\r\\nHarry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione interrupted.\\r\\n\"We already know - we heard Professor McGonagall telling\\r\\nProfessor Flitwick this morning. That\\'s why we decided we\\'d better get\\r\\ngoing -\"\\r\\n\"The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better,\" snarled\\r\\nRon. \"D\\'you know what I think? He was in such a foul temper after\\r\\nthe Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin.\"\\r\\n\"There\\'s something else,\" said Harry, watching Hermione tearing\\r\\nbundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion. \"Dobby came\\r\\nto visit me in the middle of the night.\"\\r\\nRon and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told them everything\\r\\nDobby had told him - or hadn\\'t told him. Hermione and Ron listened\\r\\nwith their mouths open.\\r\\n\"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?\" Hermione said.\\r\\n\"This settles it,\" said Ron in a triumphant voice. \"Lucius Malfoy must\\'ve\\r\\nopened the Chamber when he was at school here and now he\\'s told\\r\\ndear old Draco how to do it. It\\'s obvious. Wish Dobby\\'d told you what\\r\\nkind of monster\\'s in there, though. I want to know how come nobody\\'s\\r\\nnoticed it sneaking around the school.\"\\r\\n\"Maybe it can make itself invisible,\" said Hermione, prodding leeches to\\r\\nthe bottom of the cauldron. \"Or maybe it can disguise itself - pretend to\\r\\nbe a suit of armor or something - I\\'ve read about Chameleon Ghouls -\"\\r\\n\"You read too much, Hermione,\" said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on\\r\\ntop of the leeches. He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked\\r\\nat Harry.\\r\\n\"So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your\\r\\narm He shook his head. \"You know what, Harry? If he doesn\\'t\\r\\nstop trying to save your life he\\'s going to kill you.\"\\r\\n*184*\\r\\n156\\r\\nThe news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying\\r\\nas though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire\\r\\nschool by Monday morning. The air was suddenly thick with rumor\\r\\nand suspicion. The first years were now moving around the castle in\\r\\ntight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they\\r\\nventured forth alone.\\r\\nGinny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was\\r\\ndistraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the\\r\\nwrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns covering\\r\\nthemselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind\\r\\nstatues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told\\r\\nthem he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was\\r\\nhaving nightmares.\\r\\nMeanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans,\\r\\namulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school.\\r\\nNeville Longbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a\\r\\npointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other\\r\\nGryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger; he was a pureblood,\\r\\nand therefore unlikely to be attacked.\\r\\n\"They went for Filch first,\" Neville said, his round face fearful. \"And\\r\\neveryone knows I\\'m almost a Squib.\"\\r\\nIn the second week of December Professor McGonagall came\\r\\naround as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at\\r\\nschool for Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; they\\r\\nhad heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very\\r\\nsuspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use the\\r\\nPolyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him.\\r\\nUnfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still\\r\\n* 3-85*\\r\\nneeded the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place\\r\\nthey were going to get them was from Snape\\'s private stores. Harry\\r\\nprivately felt he\\'d rather face Slytherin\\'s legendary monster than let\\r\\nSnape catch him robbing his office.\\r\\n157\\r\\n\"What we need,\" said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon\\'s\\r\\ndouble Potions lesson loomed nearer, \"is a diversion. Then one of us\\r\\ncan sneak into Snape\\'s office and take what we need.\"\\r\\nHarry and Ron looked at her nervously.\\r\\n\"I think Id better do the actual stealing,\" Hermione continued in a\\r\\nmatter-of-fact tone. \"You two will be expelled if you get into any more\\r\\ntrouble, and I\\'ve got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause\\r\\nenough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.\\r\\nHarry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape\\'s Potions\\r\\nclass was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.\\r\\nPotions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday\\r\\nafternoon\\'s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons\\r\\nstood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass\\r\\nscales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes,\\r\\nmaking waspish remarks about the Gryffindors\\' work while the\\r\\nSlytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape\\'s\\r\\nfavorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who\\r\\nknew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you\\r\\ncould say \"Unfair.\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on\\r\\nmore important things. He was waiting for Hermione\\'s signal, and he\\r\\nhardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery\\r\\n*186*\\r\\npotion. When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, Hermione\\r\\ncaught Harry\\'s eye and nodded.\\r\\nHarry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred\\'s\\r\\nFilibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his\\r\\nwand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had only\\r\\nseconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it\\r\\nlanded right on target in Goyle\\'s cauldron.\\r\\nGoyle\\'s potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked\\r\\nas splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and\\r\\nhis nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his\\r\\n158\\r\\nhands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate -\\r\\nSnape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened.\\r\\nThrough the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape\\'s\\r\\noffice.\\r\\n\"Silence! SILENCE!\" Snape roared. \"Anyone who has been splashed,\\r\\ncome here for a Deflating Draft - when I find out who did this -\"\\r\\nHarry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head\\r\\ndrooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the\\r\\nclass lumbered up to Snape\\'s desk, some weighted down with arms\\r\\nlike clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips, Harry\\r\\nsaw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes\\r\\nbulging.\\r\\nWhen everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings\\r\\nhad subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle\\'s cauldron and scooped out\\r\\nthe twisted black remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush.\\r\\n*187*\\r\\n\"If I ever find out who threw this,\" Snape whispered, \"I shall make\\r\\nsure that person is expelled.\"\\r\\nHarry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled\\r\\nexpression. Snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten\\r\\nminutes later could not have been more welcome.\\r\\n\"He knew it was me,\" Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried\\r\\nback to Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. \"I could tell.\"\\r\\nHermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to\\r\\nstir feverishly.\\r\\n\"It\\'ll be ready in two weeks,\" she said happily.\\r\\n\"Snape can\\'t prove it was you,\" said Ron reassuringly to Harry.\\r\\n\"What can he do?\"\\r\\n\"Knowing Snape, something foul,\" said Harry as the potion frothed\\r\\nand bubbled.\\r\\n159\\r\\nA week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking across the\\r\\nentrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around\\r\\nthe notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been\\r\\npinned up. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them\\r\\nover, looking excited.\\r\\n\"They\\'re starting a Dueling Club!\" said Seamus. \"First meeting\\r\\ntonight! I wouldn\\'t mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy\\r\\none of these days ......\\r\\n\"What, you reckon Slytherin\\'s monster can duel?\" said Ron, but he,\\r\\ntoo, read the sign with interest.\\r\\n\"Could be useful,\" he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into\\r\\ndinner. \"Shall we go?\"\\r\\nHarry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o\\'clock that\\r\\n*188*\\r\\nevening they hurried back to the Great Hall. The long dining tables\\r\\nhad vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by\\r\\nthousands of candles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety\\r\\nblack once more and most of the school seemed to be packed\\r\\nbeneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited.\\r\\n\"I wonder who\\'ll be teaching us?\" said Hermione as they edged into\\r\\nthe chattering crowd. \"Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling\\r\\nchampion when he was young - maybe it\\'ll be him.\"\\r\\n\"As long as it\\'s not -\" Harry began, but he ended on a groan:\\r\\nGilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes\\r\\nof deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape, wearing\\r\\nhis usual black.\\r\\nLockhart waved an arm for silence and called \\' \"Gather round,\\r\\ngather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me?\\r\\nExcellent!\\r\\n\"Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start\\r\\nthis little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend\\r\\nyourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions - for full\\r\\n160\\r\\ndetails, see my published works.\\r\\n\"Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape,\" said Lockhart,\\r\\nflashing a wide smile. \"He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about\\r\\ndueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short\\r\\ndemonstration before we begin. Now, I don\\'t want any of you\\r\\nyoungsters to worry - you\\'ll still have your Potions master when I\\'m\\r\\nthrough with him, never fear!\"\\r\\n\"Wouldn\\'t it be good if they finished each other off?\" Ron muttered in\\r\\nHarry\\'s ear.\\r\\nSnape\\'s upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why Lockhart\\r\\n*189*\\r\\nwas still smiling; if Snape had been looking at him like that he\\'d have\\r\\nbeen running as fast as he could in the opposite direction.\\r\\nLockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at least,\\r\\nLockhart did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas Snape jerked\\r\\nhis head irritably. Then they raised their wands like swords in front of\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\"As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative\\r\\nposition,\" Lockhart told the silent crowd. \"On the count of three, we\\r\\nwill cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.\"\\r\\n\"I wouldn\\'t bet on that,\" Harry murmured, watching Snape baring his\\r\\nteeth.\\r\\n\"One - two - three -\"\\r\\nBoth of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them\\r\\nat their opponent; Snape cried: \"Expelliarmus!\" There was a dazzling\\r\\nflash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew\\r\\nbackward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to\\r\\nsprawl on the floor.\\r\\nMalfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered. Hermione was\\r\\ndancing on tiptoes. \"Do you think he\\'s all right?\" she squealed through\\r\\nher fingers.\\r\\n161\\r\\n\"Who cares?\" said Harry and Ron together.\\r\\nLockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat had fallen off and\\r\\nhis wavy hair was standing on end.\\r\\n\"Well, there you have it!\" he said, tottering back onto the platform.\\r\\n\"That was a Disarming Charm - as you see, I\\'ve lost my wand - ah,\\r\\nthank you, Miss Brown - yes, an excellent idea to show them that,\\r\\nProfessor Snape, but if you don\\'t mind my saying\\r\\n*190*\\r\\nso, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to\\r\\nstop you it would have been only too easy - however, I felt it would be\\r\\ninstructive to let them see . . .\"\\r\\nSnape was looking murderous. Possibly Lockhart had noticed, because\\r\\nhe said, \"Enough demonstrating! I\\'m going to come amongst you now\\r\\nand put you all into pairs. Professor Snape, if you\\'d like to help me -\"\\r\\nThey moved through the crowd, matching up partners. Lockhart\\r\\nteamed Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Snape reached Harry\\r\\nand Ron first.\\r\\n\"Time to split up the dream team, I think,\" he sneered. \"Weasley, you\\r\\ncan partner Finnigan. Potter -\"\\r\\nHarry moved automatically toward Hermione.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think so,\" said Snape, smiling coldly. \"Mr. Malfoy, come over\\r\\nhere. Let\\'s see what you make of the famous Potter. And you, Miss\\r\\nGranger - you can partner Miss Bulstrode.\"\\r\\nMalfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a Slytherin girl who\\r\\nreminded Harry of a picture he\\'d seen in Holidays with Hags. She was\\r\\nlarge and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione\\r\\ngave her a weak smile that she did not return.\\r\\n\"Face your partners!\" called Lockhart, back on the platform. \"And\\r\\nbow!\"\\r\\n162\\r\\nHarry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off\\r\\neach other.\\r\\n\"Wands at the ready!\" shouted Lockhart. \"When I count to three, cast\\r\\nyour charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm them - we don\\'t\\r\\nwant any accidents - one ... two ... three -\"\\r\\n*191*\\r\\nHarry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on \"two\":\\r\\nHis spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he\\'d been hit over the\\r\\nhead with a saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be\\r\\nworking, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at\\r\\nMalfoy and shouted, \"Rictusempra!\"\\r\\nA jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up,\\r\\nwheezing.\\r\\n\"I said disarm only!\" Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the\\r\\nbattling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his knees; Harry had hit him with a\\r\\nTickling Charm, and he could barely move for laughing. Harry hung\\r\\nback, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy\\r\\nwhile he was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath,\\r\\nMalfoy pointed his wand at Harry\\'s knees, choked, \"Tarantallegra!\"\\r\\nand the next second Harry\\'s legs began to jerk around out of his\\r\\ncontrol in a kind of quickstep.\\r\\n\"Stop! Stop!\" screamed Lockhart, but Snape took charge.\\r\\n\"Finite Incantatem!\" he shouted; Harry\\'s feet stopped dancing, Malfoy\\r\\nstopped laughing, and they were able to look up.\\r\\nA haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene. Both Neville\\r\\nand Justin were lying on the floor, panting; Ron was holding up an\\r\\nashen-faced Seamus, apologizing for whatever his broken wand had\\r\\ndone; but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving;\\r\\nMillicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whimpering\\r\\nin pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor. Harry leapt\\r\\nforward and pulled Millicent off. It was difficult: She was a lot bigger\\r\\nthan he was.\\r\\n\"Dear, dear,\" said Lockhart, skittering through the crowd, looking at\\r\\n163\\r\\nthe aftermath of the duels. \"Up you go, Macmillan ....\\r\\n*192*\\r\\nCareful there, Miss Fawcett .... Pinch it hard, it\\'ll stop bleeding in a\\r\\nsecond, Boot\\r\\n\"I think Id better teach you how to block unfriendly spells,\" said\\r\\nLockhart, standing flustered in the midst of the hall. He glanced at\\r\\nSnape, whose black eyes glinted, and looked quickly away. \"Let\\'s\\r\\nhave a volunteer pair - Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley, how about\\r\\nyou -\"\\r\\n\"A bad idea, Professor Lockhart,\" said Snape, gliding over like a large\\r\\nand malevolent bat. \"Longbottom causes devastation with the simplest\\r\\nspells. We\\'ll be sending what\\'s left of Finch-Fletchley up to the\\r\\nhospital wing in a matchbox.\" Neville\\'s round, pink face went pinker.\\r\\n\"How about Malfoy and Potter?\" said Snape with a twisted smile.\\r\\n\"Excellent idea!\" said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and Malfoy into the\\r\\nmiddle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room.\\r\\n\"Now, Harry,\" said Lockhart. \"When Draco points his wand at you,\\r\\nyou do this.\"\\r\\nHe raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wiggling\\r\\naction, and dropped it. Snape smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up,\\r\\nsaying, \"Whoops -my wand is a little overexcited -\"\\r\\nSnape moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and whispered something\\r\\nin his ear. Malfoy smirked, too. Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart\\r\\nand said, \"Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again?\"\\r\\n\"Scared?\" muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn\\'t hear him.\\r\\n\"You wish,\" said Harry out of the corner of his mouth.\\r\\nLockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder. \"Just do what I did,\\r\\nHarry!\"\\r\\n\"What, drop my wand?\"\\r\\n164\\r\\nBut Lockhart wasn\\'t listening.\\r\\n\"Three - two - one - go!\" he shouted.\\r\\nMalfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed, \"Serpensortia!\"\\r\\nThe end of his wand exploded. Harry watched, aghast, as a long black\\r\\nsnake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, and\\r\\nraised itself, ready to strike. There were screams as the crowd\\r\\nbacked swiftly away, clearing the floor.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t move, Potter,\" said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of\\r\\nHarry standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. \"I\\'ll get\\r\\nrid of it ......\\r\\n\"Allow me!\" shouted Lockhart. He brandished his wand at the snake\\r\\nand there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten\\r\\nfeet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged,\\r\\nhissing furiously, it slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and\\r\\nraised itself again, fangs exposed, poised to strike.\\r\\nHarry wasn\\'t sure what made him do it. He wasn\\'t even aware of\\r\\ndeciding to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him\\r\\nforward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly\\r\\nat the snake, \"Leave him alone!\" And miraculously - inexplicably - the\\r\\nsnake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, its\\r\\neyes now on Harry. Harry felt the fear drain out of him. He knew the\\r\\nsnake wouldn\\'t attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn\\'t\\r\\nhave explained.\\r\\nHe looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see Justin looking\\r\\n*194*\\r\\nrelieved, or puzzled, or even grateful - but certainly not angry and\\r\\nscared.\\r\\n\"What do you think you\\'re playing at?\" he shouted, and before Harry\\r\\ncould say anything, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall.\\r\\nSnape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in a\\r\\nsmall puff of black smoke. Snape, too, was looking at Harry in an\\r\\n165\\r\\nunexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Harry\\r\\ndidn\\'t like it. He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all\\r\\naround the walls. Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes.\\r\\n\"Come on,\" said Rods voice in his ear. \"Move - come on -\"\\r\\nRon steered him out of the hall, Hermione hurrying alongside them. As\\r\\nthey went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as\\r\\nthough they were frightened of catching something. Harry didn\\'t have\\r\\na clue what was going on, and neither Ron nor Hermione explained\\r\\nanything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty\\r\\nGryffindor common room. Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair\\r\\nand said, \"You\\'re a Parselmouth. Why didn\\'t you tell us?\"\\r\\n\"I\\'m a what?\" said Harry.\\r\\n`A Parselmouth!\" said Ron. \"You can talk to snakes!\"\\r\\n\"I know,\" said Harry. \"I mean, that\\'s only the second time I\\'ve ever\\r\\ndone it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the\\r\\nzoo once - long story - but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil\\r\\nand I sort of set it free without meaning to that was before I knew I\\r\\nwas a wizard -\"\\r\\n\"A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?\" Ron repeated\\r\\nfaintly.\\r\\n*195*\\r\\n\"So?\" said Harry. \"I bet loads of people here can do it.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, no they can\\'t,\" said Ron. \"It\\'s not a very common gift. Harry, this\\r\\nis bad.\"\\r\\n\"What\\'s bad?\" said Harry, starting to feel quite angry. \"What\\'s wrong\\r\\nwith everyone? Listen, if I hadn\\'t told that snake not to attack Justin -\"\\r\\n\"Oh, that\\'s what you said to it?\"\\r\\n\"What d\\'you mean? You were there - you heard me -\"\\r\\n\"I heard you speaking Parseltongue,\" said Ron. \"Snake language. You\\r\\n166\\r\\ncould have been saying anything - no wonder Justin panicked, you\\r\\nsounded like you were egging the snake on or something - it was\\r\\ncreepy, you know -\"\\r\\nHarry gaped at him.\\r\\n\"I spoke a different language? But - I didn\\'t realize - how can I speak\\r\\na language without knowing I can speak it?\"\\r\\nRon shook his head. Both he and Hermione were looking as though\\r\\nsomeone had died. Harry couldn\\'t see what was so terrible.\\r\\n\"D\\'you want to tell me what\\'s wrong with stopping a massive snake\\r\\nbiting off Justin\\'s head?\" he said. \"What does it matter how I did it as\\r\\nlong as Justin doesn\\'t have to join the Headless Hunt?\"\\r\\n\"It matters,\" said Hermione, speaking at last in a hushed voice,\\r\\n\"because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was\\r\\nfamous for. That\\'s why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s mouth fell open.\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" said Ron. \"And now the whole school\\'s going to think you\\'re\\r\\nhis great-great-great-great-grandson or something -\"\\r\\n\"But I\\'m not,\" said Harry, with a panic he couldn\\'t quite explain.\\r\\n\"You\\'ll find that hard to prove,\" said Hermione. \"He lived about a\\r\\nthousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.\"\\r\\n* IL96 *\\r\\nHarry lay awake for hours that night. Through a gap in the curtains\\r\\naround his four-poster he watched snow starting to drift past the\\r\\ntower window and wondered . . .\\r\\nCould he be a descendant of Salazar Slithering? He didn\\'t know\\r\\nanything about his father\\'s family, after all. The Dursleys had always\\r\\nforbidden questions about his wizarding relatives.\\r\\nQuietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue. The words\\r\\nwouldn\\'t come. It seemed he had to be face-to-face with a snake to\\r\\n167\\r\\ndo it.\\r\\nBut I\\'m in Gryffindor, Harry thought. The Sorting Hat wouldn\\'t\\r\\nhave put me in here if I had Slytherin blood...\\r\\nAh, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the Sorting Hat wanted to\\r\\nput you in Slytherin, don\\'t you remember?\\r\\nHarry turned over. He\\'d see Justin the next day in Herbology and he\\'d\\r\\nexplain that he\\'d been calling the snake off, not egging it on, which (he\\r\\nthought angrily, pummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized.\\r\\nBy next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had\\r\\nturned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the\\r\\nterm was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves\\r\\non the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else,\\r\\nnow that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and\\r\\nrevive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey.\\r\\nHarry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common\\r\\nroom, while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of\\r\\nwizard chess.\\r\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, Harry,\" said Hermione, exasperated, as one\\r\\n*197*\\r\\nof Ron\\'s bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off\\r\\nthe board. \"Go and find Justin if it\\'s so important to you.\"\\r\\nSo Harry got up and left through the portrait hole, wondering where\\r\\nJustin might be.\\r\\nThe castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the\\r\\nthick, swirling gray snow at every window. Shivering, Harry walked\\r\\npast classrooms where lessons were taking place, catching snatches of\\r\\nwhat was happening within. Professor McGonagall was shouting at\\r\\nsomeone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend into a badger.\\r\\nResisting the urge to take a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that\\r\\nJustin might be using his free time to catch up on some work, and\\r\\ndeciding to check the library first.\\r\\n168\\r\\nA group of the Hufliepuffs who should have been in Herbology were\\r\\nindeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn\\'t seem to be\\r\\nworking. Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see\\r\\nthat their heads were close together and they were having what looked\\r\\nlike an absorbing conversation. He couldn\\'t see whether Justin was\\r\\namong them. He was walking toward them when something of what\\r\\nthey were saying met his ears, and he paused to listen, hidden in the\\r\\nInvisibility section.\\r\\n\"So anyway,\" a stout boy was saying, \"I told Justin to hide up in our\\r\\ndormitory. I mean to say, if Potter\\'s marked him down as his next\\r\\nvictim, it\\'s best if he keeps a low profile for a while. Of course, Justin\\'s\\r\\nbeen waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to\\r\\nPotter he was Muggle-born. Justin actually told him he\\'d been down\\r\\nfor Eton. That\\'s not the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin\\'s\\r\\nheir on the loose, is it?\"\\r\\n\"You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?\" said a girl with blonde\\r\\npigtails anxiously.\\r\\n198\\r\\n\"Hannah,\" said the stout boy solemnly, \"he\\'s a Parselmouth. Everyone\\r\\nknows that\\'s the mark of a Dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a\\r\\ndecent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself\\r\\nSerpent-tongue.\"\\r\\nThere was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie went on,\\r\\n\"Remember what was written on the wall? Enemies of the Heir,\\r\\nBeware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we\\r\\nknow, Flich\\'s cat\\'s attacked. That first year, Creevey, was annoying\\r\\nPotter at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him while he was\\r\\nlying in the mud. Next thing we know - Creevey\\'s been attacked.\"\\r\\n\"He always seems so nice, though,\" said Hannah uncertainly, \"and,\\r\\nwell, he\\'s the one who made You-Know-Who disappear. He can\\'t be\\r\\nall bad, can he?\"\\r\\nErnie lowered his voice mysteriously, the Hufflepuffs bent closer, and\\r\\nHarry edged nearer so that he could catch Ernie\\'s words.\\r\\n\"No one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who. I\\r\\n169\\r\\nmean to say, he was only a baby when it happened. He should have\\r\\nbeen blasted into smithereens. Only a really powerful Dark wizard\\r\\ncould have survived a curse like that.\" He dropped his voice until it\\r\\nwas barely more than a whisper, and said, \"That\\'s probably why You-\\r\\nKnow-Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn\\'t want another\\r\\nDark Lord competing with him. I wonder what other powers Potter\\'s\\r\\nbeen hiding?\"\\r\\nHarry couldn\\'t take anymore. Clearing his throat loudly, he stepped out\\r\\nfrom behind the bookshelves. If he hadn\\'t been feeling so angry, he\\r\\nwould have found the sight that greeted him funny: Every one of the\\r\\nHufflepuffs looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of\\r\\nhim, and the color was draining out of Ernie\\'s face.\\r\\n*199*\\r\\n\"Hello,\" said Harry. \"I\\'m looking for Justin Finch-Fletchley.\"\\r\\nThe Hufepuffs\\' worst fears had clearly been confirmed. They all\\r\\nlooked fearfully at Ernie.\\r\\n\"What do you want with him?\" said Ernie in a quavering voice.\\r\\n\"I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the\\r\\nDueling Club,\" said Harry.\\r\\nErnie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, \"We\\r\\nwere all there. We saw what happened.\"\\r\\n\"Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed off?\"\\r\\nsaid Harry.\\r\\n\"All I saw,\" said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as he\\r\\nspoke, \"was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake\\r\\ntoward Justin. \"\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t chase it at him!\" Harry said, his voice shaking with anger. \"It\\r\\ndidn\\'t even touch him!\"\\r\\n\"It was a very near miss,\" said Ernie. \"And in case you\\'re getting\\r\\nideas,\" he added hastily, \"I might tell you that you can trace my\\r\\nfamily back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and\\r\\n170\\r\\nmy blood\\'s as pure as anyone\\'s, so -\"\\r\\n- cc I don\\'t care what sort of blood you\\'ve got!\" said Harry fiercely.\\r\\n\"Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?\"\\r\\n\"I\\'ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with,\" said Ernie swiftly.\\r\\n\"It\\'s not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them,\" said\\r\\nHarry. \"Id like to see you try it.\"\\r\\nHe turned on his heel and stormed out of the library, earning himself\\r\\na reproving glare from Madam Pince, who was polishing the gilded\\r\\ncover of a large spellbook.\\r\\n*200*\\r\\nHarry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where he was going,\\r\\nhe was in such a fury. The result was that he walked into something\\r\\nvery large and solid, which knocked him backward onto the floor.\\r\\n\"Oh, hello, Hagrid,\" Harry said, looking up.\\r\\nHagrid\\'s face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow-covered\\r\\nbalaclava, but it couldn\\'t possibly be anyone else, as he filled most of\\r\\nthe corridor in his moleskin overcoat. A dead rooster was hanging\\r\\nfrom one of his massive, gloved hands.\\r\\n\"All righ\\', Harry?\" he said, pulling up the balaclava so he could\\r\\nspeak. \"Why aren\\'t yeh in class?\"\\r\\n\"Canceled,\" said Harry, getting up. \"What\\'re you doing in here?\"\\r\\nHagrid held up the limp rooster.\\r\\n\"Second one killed this term,\" he explained. \"It\\'s either foxes or a\\r\\nBlood-Suckin Bugbear, an\\' I need the Headmaster\\'s permission ter\\r\\nput a charm around the hen coop.\"\\r\\nHe peered more closely at Harry from under his thick, snowflecked\\r\\neyebrows.\\r\\n\"Yeh sure yeh\\'re all righ\\'? Yeh look all hot an\\' bothered -\"\\r\\n171\\r\\nHarry couldn\\'t bring himself to repeat what Ernie and the rest of the\\r\\nHufflepuffs had been saying about him.\\r\\n\"It\\'s nothing,\" he said. \"Id better get going, Hagrid, it\\'s Transfiguration\\r\\nnext and I\\'ve got to pick up my books.\"\\r\\nHe walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him.\\r\\n\"Justin\\'s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he\\r\\nlet slip to Potter he was Muggle-born .....\\r\\n* 2 0 IL *\\r\\nHarry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor,\\r\\nwhich was particularly dark; the torches had been extinguished by a\\r\\nstrong, icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane. He\\r\\nwas halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over\\r\\nsomething lying on the floor.\\r\\nHe turned to squint at what he\\'d fallen over and felt as though his\\r\\nstomach had dissolved.\\r\\nJustin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of\\r\\nshock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. And\\r\\nthat wasn\\'t all. Next to him was another figure, the strangest sight\\r\\nHarry had ever seen.\\r\\nIt was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and\\r\\ntransparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal,\\r\\nsix inches off the floor. His head was half off and his face wore an\\r\\nexpression of shock identical to Justin\\'s.\\r\\nHarry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing a\\r\\nkind of drumroll against his ribs. He looked wildly up and down the\\r\\ndeserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they\\r\\ncould away from the bodies. The only sounds were the muffled\\r\\nvoices of teachers from the classes on either side.\\r\\nHe could run, and no one would ever know he had been there. But\\r\\nhe couldn\\'t just leave them lying here .... He had to get help ....\\r\\nWould anyone believe he hadn\\'t had anything to do with this?\\r\\n172\\r\\nAs he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him opened with a\\r\\nbang. Peeves the Poltergeist came shooting out.\\r\\n\"Why, it\\'s potty wee Potter!\" cackled Peeves, knocking Harry\\'s\\r\\nglasses askew as he bounced past him. \"What\\'s Potter up to? Why\\'s\\r\\nPotter lurking -\"\\r\\n*202*\\r\\nPeeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. Upside down,\\r\\nhe spotted Justin and Nearly Headless Nick. He flipped the right\\r\\nway up, filled his lungs and, before Harry could stop him, screamed,\\r\\n\"ATTACK! ATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTAL\\r\\nOR GHOST IS SAFE! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!\\r\\nATTAAAACK!\"\\r\\nCrash - crash - crash - door after door flew open along the corridor\\r\\nand people flooded out. For several long minutes, there was a scene\\r\\nof such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and\\r\\npeople kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry found himself\\r\\npinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall came running, followed by her own class, one of whom\\r\\nstill had black-and-white-striped hair. She used her wand to set off\\r\\naloud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into\\r\\ntheir classes. No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie\\r\\nthe Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene.\\r\\n\"Caught in the act!\" Ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing his\\r\\nfinger dramatically at Harry.\\r\\n\"That will do, Macmillan!\" said Professor McGonagall sharply.\\r\\nPeeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the\\r\\nscene; Peeves always loved chaos. As the teachers bent over Justin\\r\\nand Nearly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song:\\r\\n\"Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done,\\r\\nYou\\'re killing off\\' students, you think it\\'s good fun -\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s enough Peeves!\" barked Professor McGonagall, and Peeves\\r\\nzoomed away backward, with his tongue out at Harry.\\r\\n173\\r\\n*203*\\r\\nJustin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and\\r\\nProfessor Sinistra of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed\\r\\nto know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the end, Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave to\\r\\nErnie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs.\\r\\nThis Ernie did, fanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. This\\r\\nleft Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together.\\r\\n\"This way, Potter,\" she said.\\r\\n\"Professor,\" said Harry at once, \"I swear I didn\\'t -\"\\r\\n\"This is out of my hands, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall curtly.\\r\\nThey marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a\\r\\nlarge and extremely ugly stone gargoyle.\\r\\n\"Lemon drop!\" she said. This was evidently a password, because the\\r\\ngargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind\\r\\nhim split in two. Even full of dread for what was coming, Harry\\r\\ncouldn\\'t fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that\\r\\nwas moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. As he and Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed behind\\r\\nthem. They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last,\\r\\nslightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass\\r\\nknocker in the shape of a griffin.\\r\\nHe knew now where he was being taken. This must be where\\r\\nDumbledore lived.\\r\\n*204*\\r\\nC I3 A P T V RR T W E I V\\r\\nTHE POLYJUICE POTION\\r\\nhey stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall rapped on the door. It opened silently and they entered.\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there, alone.\\r\\n174\\r\\nHarry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers\\'\\r\\noffices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore\\'s was by far\\r\\nthe most interesting. If he hadn\\'t been scared out of his wits that he\\r\\nwas about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very\\r\\npleased to have a chance to look around it.\\r\\nIt was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A\\r\\nnumber of curious silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tables,\\r\\nwhirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered\\r\\nwith portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom\\r\\nwere snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous,\\r\\nclaw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered\\r\\nwizard\\'s hat - the Sorting Hat.\\r\\n*205*\\r\\nHarry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and\\r\\nwizards on the walls. Surely it couldn\\'t hurt if he took the hat down\\r\\nand tried it on again? Just to see ... just to make sure it had put him in\\r\\nthe right House\\r\\nHe walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and\\r\\nlowered it slowly onto his head. It was much too large and slipped\\r\\ndown over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he\\'d put it on.\\r\\nHarry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a small voice\\r\\nsaid in his ear, \"Bee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?\"\\r\\n\"Er, yes,\" Harry muttered. \"Er - sorry to bother you - I wanted to ask -\\r\\n\"\\r\\n\"You\\'ve been wondering whether I put you in the right House,\" said\\r\\nthe hat smartly. \"Yes ... you were particularly difficult to place. But I\\r\\nstand by what I said before\" - Harry\\'s heart leapt - \"you would have\\r\\ndone well in Slytherin -\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of the hat and\\r\\npulled it off. It hung limply in his hand, grubby and faded. Harry\\r\\npushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick.\\r\\n175\\r\\n\"You\\'re wrong,\" he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn\\'t move.\\r\\nHarry backed away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging noise behind\\r\\nhim made him wheel around.\\r\\nHe wasn\\'t alone after all. Standing on a golden perch behind the door\\r\\nwas a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey.\\r\\nHarry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making its\\r\\ngagging noise again. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dull\\r\\nand, even as Harry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail.\\r\\nHarry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore\\'s\\r\\npet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the bird\\r\\nburst into flames.\\r\\nHarry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. He looked\\r\\nfeverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but\\r\\ncouldn\\'t see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave\\r\\none loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smouldering\\r\\npile of ash on the floor.\\r\\nThe office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking very somber.\\r\\n\"Professor,\" Harry gasped. \"Your bird - I couldn\\'t do anything - he just\\r\\ncaught fire -\"\\r\\nTo Harry\\'s astonishment, Dumbledore smiled.\\r\\n\"About time, too,\" he said. \"He\\'s been looking dreadful for days; I\\'ve\\r\\nbeen telling him to get a move on.\"\\r\\nHe chuckled at the stunned look on Harry\\'s face.\\r\\n\"Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is\\r\\ntime for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Watch him . . .\"\\r\\nHarry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke\\r\\nits head out of the ashes. It was quite as ugly as the old one.\\r\\n\"It\\'s a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,\" said Dumbledore,\\r\\nseating himself behind his desk. \"He\\'s really very handsome most of\\r\\nthe time, wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating creatures,\\r\\n176\\r\\nphoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have\\r\\nhealing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.\"\\r\\nIn the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what he\\r\\nwas there for, but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settled\\r\\nhimself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his\\r\\npenetrating, light-blue stare.\\r\\nBefore Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of\\r\\nthe office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild\\r\\nlook in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head\\r\\nand the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.\\r\\n\"It wasn\\' Harry, Professor Dumbledore!\" said Hagrid urgently. \"I was\\r\\ntalkin\\' ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir -\\r\\n\"\\r\\nDumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on,\\r\\nwaving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers\\r\\neverywhere.\\r\\n\"- it can\\'t\\'ve bin him, I\\'ll swear it in front o\\' the Ministry o\\' Magic if I\\r\\nhave to -\"\\r\\n\"Hagrid, I -\"\\r\\n\"- yeh\\'ve got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never =\\'\\r\\n\"Hagrid!\" said Dumbledore loudly. \"I do not think that Harry\\r\\nattacked those people.\"\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side. \"Right. I\\'ll wait\\r\\noutside then, Headmaster.\"\\r\\nAnd he stomped out looking embarrassed.\\r\\n\"You don\\'t think it was me, Professor?\" Harry repeated hopefully as\\r\\nDumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk.\\r\\n\"No, Harry, I don\\'t,\" said Dumbledore, though his face was somber\\r\\nagain. \"But I still want to talk to you.\"\\r\\n177\\r\\nHarry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of\\r\\nhis long fingers together.\\r\\n*208*\\r\\n\"I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you\\'d like to tell me,\"\\r\\nhe said gently. \"Anything at all.\"\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, \"You\\'ll\\r\\nbe next, Mudbloods!\" and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in\\r\\nMoaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied\\r\\nvoice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said:\\r\\n\"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn\\'t a good sign, even in the\\r\\nwizarding world.\" He thought, too, about what everyone was saying\\r\\nabout him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected\\r\\nwith Salazar Slytherin ....\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"There isn\\'t anything, Professor . . . .\"\\r\\nThe double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what\\r\\nhad hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly\\r\\nHeadless Nick\\'s fate that seemed to worry people most. What could\\r\\npossibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; what terrible\\r\\npower could harm someone who was already dead? There was\\r\\nalmost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that\\r\\nstudents could go home for Christmas.\\r\\n\"At this rate, we\\'ll be the only ones left,\" Ron told Harry and\\r\\nHermione. \"Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it\\'s\\r\\ngoing to be.\"\\r\\nCrabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed\\r\\nup to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most people\\r\\nwere leaving. He was tired of people skirting around him in the\\r\\ncorridors, as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired\\r\\nof all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.\\r\\n*209*\\r\\nFred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out of\\r\\ntheir way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting,\\r\\n178\\r\\n\"Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming\\r\\nthrough ......\\r\\nPercy was deeply disapproving of this behavior.\\r\\n\"It is not a laughing matter,\" he said coldly.\\r\\n\"Oh, get out of the way, Percy,\" said Fred. \"Harry\\'s in a hurry.\"\\r\\n\"Yeah, he\\'s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his\\r\\nfanged servant,\" said George, chortling.\\r\\nGinny didn\\'t find it amusing either.\\r\\n\"Oh, don\\'t,\" she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he\\r\\nwas planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry\\r\\noff with a large clove of garlic when they met.\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at\\r\\nleast, thought the idea of his being Slytherin\\'s heir was quite ludicrous.\\r\\nBut their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked\\r\\nincreasingly sour each time he saw them at it.\\r\\n\"It\\'s because he\\'s bursting to say it\\'s really him,\" said Ron knowingly.\\r\\n\"You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you\\'re\\r\\ngetting all the credit for his dirty work.\"\\r\\n\"Not for long,\" said Hermione in a satisfied tone. \"The Polyjuice\\r\\nPotion\\'s nearly ready. We\\'ll be getting the truth out of him any day\\r\\nnow.\"\\r\\nAt last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds\\r\\ndescended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy,\\r\\nand enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run\\r\\nof Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could\\r\\n*210*\\r\\nplay Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice\\r\\ndueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at\\r\\nschool rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.\\r\\nPercy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior,\\r\\n179\\r\\ndidn\\'t spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. He had\\r\\nalready told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas\\r\\nbecause it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during\\r\\nthis troubled time.\\r\\nChristmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, the only\\r\\nones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione,\\r\\nwho burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.\\r\\n\"Wake up,\" she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window.\\r\\n\"Hermione - you\\'re not supposed to be in here -\" said Ron, shielding\\r\\nhis eyes against the light.\\r\\n\"Merry Christmas to you, too,\" said Hermione, throwing him his\\r\\npresent. \"I\\'ve been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to\\r\\nthe potion. It\\'s ready.\"\\r\\nHarry sat up, suddenly wide awake.\\r\\n\"Are you sure?\"\\r\\n\"Positive,\" said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could\\r\\nsit down on the end of Ron\\'s four-poster. \"If we\\'re going to do it, I\\r\\nsay it should be tonight.\"\\r\\nAt that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a very\\r\\nsmall package in her beak.\\r\\n\"Hello,\" said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. \"Are you\\r\\nspeaking to me again?\"\\r\\n211\\r\\nShe nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far\\r\\nbetter present than the one that she had brought him, which turned\\r\\nout to be from the Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a\\r\\nnote telling him to find out whether he\\'d be able to stay at Hogwarts\\r\\nfor the summer vacation, too.\\r\\nThe rest of Harry\\'s Christmas presents were far more satisfactory.\\r\\nHagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge, which Harry decided\\r\\n180\\r\\nto soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called\\r\\nFlying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite\\r\\nQuidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxury eagle-feather\\r\\nquill. Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted\\r\\nsweater from Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card\\r\\nwith a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley\\'s car (which\\r\\nhadn\\'t been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the\\r\\nbout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next.\\r\\nNo one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later,\\r\\ncould fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts.\\r\\nThe Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen\\r\\nfrost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and\\r\\nmistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling,\\r\\nwarm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of his\\r\\nfavorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every\\r\\ngoblet of eggnog he consumed. Percy, who hadn\\'t noticed that Fred\\r\\nhad bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read \"Pinhead,\" kept\\r\\nasking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry didn\\'t even care\\r\\nthat Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remarks\\r\\n* 2:L2 *\\r\\nabout his new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck,\\r\\nMalfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours\\' time.\\r\\nHarry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas\\r\\npudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their\\r\\nplans for the evening.\\r\\n\"We still need a bit of the people you\\'re changing into,\" said\\r\\nHermione matter-of-facdy, as though she were sending them to the\\r\\nsupermarket for laundry detergent. \"And obviously, it\\'ll be best if you\\r\\ncan get something of Crabbe\\'s and Goyle\\'s; they\\'re Malfoys best\\r\\nfriends, he\\'ll tell them anything. And we also need to make sure the\\r\\nreal Crabbe and Goyle can\\'t burst in on us while we\\'re interrogating\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got it all worked out,\" she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry\\'s\\r\\nand Ron\\'s stupefied faces. She held up two plump chocolate cakes.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is\\r\\n181\\r\\nmake sure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how greedy they\\r\\nare, they\\'re bound to eat them. Once they\\'re asleep, pull out a few of\\r\\ntheir hairs and hide them in a broom closet.\"\\r\\nHarry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.\\r\\n\"Hermione, I don\\'t think -\"\\r\\n\"That could go seriously wrong -\"\\r\\nBut Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall sometimes had.\\r\\n\"The potion will be useless without Crabbe\\'s and Goyle\\'s hair,\" she\\r\\nsaid sternly. \"You do want to investigate Malfoy, don\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\"Oh, all right, all right,\" said Harry. \"But what about you? Whose hair\\r\\nare you ripping out?\"\\r\\n*213*\\r\\n\"I\\'ve already got mine!\" said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle\\r\\nout of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it.\\r\\n\"Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling\\r\\nClub? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me!\\r\\nAnd she\\'s gone home for Christmas - so I\\'ll just have to tell the\\r\\nSlytherins I\\'ve decided to come back.\"\\r\\nWhen Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion\\r\\nagain, Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression.\\r\\n\"Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go\\r\\nwrong?\"\\r\\nBut to Harry\\'s and Ron\\'s utter amazement, stage one of the\\r\\noperation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said. They lurked\\r\\nin the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe\\r\\nand Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling\\r\\ndown fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched the chocolate\\r\\ncakes on the end of the banisters. When they spotted Crabbe and\\r\\nGoyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly\\r\\nbehind a suit of armor next to the front door.\\r\\n182\\r\\n\"How thick can you get?\" Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe\\r\\ngleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. Grinning\\r\\nstupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. For a\\r\\nmoment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their\\r\\nfaces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both\\r\\nkeeled over backward onto the floor.\\r\\nBy far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall.\\r\\nOnce they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry\\r\\nyanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle\\'s fore\\r\\n* _2 14 *\\r\\nhead and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe\\'s hairs. They also stole\\r\\ntheir shoes, because their own were far too small for Crabbe- and\\r\\nGoyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they\\r\\nsprinted up to Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom.\\r\\nThey could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall\\r\\nin which Hermione was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes up\\r\\nover their faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door.\\r\\n\"Hermione?\"\\r\\nThey heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shinyfaced\\r\\nand looking anxious. Behind her they heard the gloop gloop\\r\\nof the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on\\r\\nthe toilet seat.\\r\\n\"Did you get them?\" Hermione asked breathlessly.\\r\\nHarry showed her Goyle\\'s hair.\\r\\n\"Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,\" Hermione\\r\\nsaid, holding up a small sack. \"You\\'ll need bigger sizes once you\\'re\\r\\nCrabbe and Goyle.\"\\r\\nThe three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked\\r\\nlike thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly.\\r\\n\"I\\'m sure I\\'ve done everything right,\" said Hermione, nervously\\r\\n183\\r\\nrereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. \"It looks like the\\r\\nbook says it should ... once we\\'ve drunk it, we\\'ll have exactly an hour\\r\\nbefore we change back into ourselves.\"\\r\\n\"Now what?\" Ron whispered.\\r\\n\"We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.\"\\r\\nHermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses.\\r\\nThen, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode\\'s hair out of\\r\\nits bottle into the first glass.\\r\\n*215*\\r\\nThe potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A\\r\\nsecond later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.\\r\\n\"Urgh - essence of Millicent Bulstrode,\" said Ron, eyeing it with\\r\\nloathing. \"Bet it tastes disgusting.\"\\r\\n\"Add yours, then,\" said Hermione.\\r\\nHarry dropped Goyle\\'s hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe\\'s\\r\\ninto the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle\\'s turned the\\r\\nkhaki color of a booger, Crabbe\\'s a dark, murky brown.\\r\\n\"Hang on,\" said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses.\\r\\n\"We\\'d better not all drink them in here .... Once we turn into Crabbe\\r\\nand Goyle we won\\'t fit. And Millicent Bulstrode\\'s no pixie.\\r\\n\"Good thinking,\" said Ron, unlocking the door. \"We\\'ll take separate\\r\\nstalls.\"\\r\\nCareful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into\\r\\nthe middle stall.\\r\\n\"Ready?\" he called.\\r\\n\"Ready,\" came Ron\\'s and Hermione\\'s voices.\\r\\n\"One - two - three -\"\\r\\n184\\r\\nPinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps. It\\r\\ntasted like overcooked cabbage.\\r\\nImmediately, his insides started writhing as though he\\'d just swallowed\\r\\nlive snakes - doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be\\r\\nsick - then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the\\r\\nvery ends of his fingers and toes - next, bringing him gasping to all\\r\\nfours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his body\\r\\nbubbled like hot wax - and before his eyes, his hands began to grow,\\r\\nthe fingers thickened, the nails broadened,\\r\\n* 2116 *\\r\\nthe knuckles were bulging like bolts -his shoulders stretched painfully\\r\\nand a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down\\r\\ntoward his eyebrows - his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a\\r\\nbarrel bursting its hoops - his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too\\r\\nsmall\\r\\nAs suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Harry lay facedown\\r\\non the stone-cold floor, listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end\\r\\ntoilet. With difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So this was\\r\\nwhat it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand trembling, he pulled off\\r\\nhis old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on\\r\\nthe spare ones, and laced up Goyle\\'s boatlike shoes. He reached up to\\r\\nbrush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry\\r\\nbristles, low on his forehead. Then he realized that his glasses were\\r\\nclouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn\\'t need them - he took\\r\\nthem off and called, \"Are you two okay?\" Goyle\\'s low rasp of a voice\\r\\nissued from his mouth.\\r\\n\"Yeah,\" came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right.\\r\\nHarry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror.\\r\\nGoyle stared back at him out of dull, deepset eyes. Harry scratched\\r\\nhis ear. So did Goyle.\\r\\nRon\\'s door opened. They stared at each other. Except that he looked\\r\\npale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the\\r\\npudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms.\\r\\n\"This is unbelievable,\" said Ron, approaching the mirror and prodding\\r\\n185\\r\\nCrabbe\\'s flat nose. \"Unbelievable. \"\\r\\n\"We\\'d better get going,\" said Harry, loosening the watch that was\\r\\ncutting into Goyle\\'s thick wrist. \"We\\'ve still got to find out\\r\\n* 217*\\r\\nwhere the Slytherin common room is. I only hope we can find\\r\\nsomeone to follow. . .\"\\r\\nRon, who had been gazing at Harry, said, \"You don\\'t know how\\r\\nbizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.\" He banged on Hermione\\'s door.\\r\\n\"C\\'mon, we need to go -\"\\r\\nA high-pitched voice answered him.\\r\\n\"I - I don\\'t think I\\'m going to come after all. You go on without me.\\r\\n\"Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode\\'s ugly, no one\\'s going to\\r\\nknow it\\'s you -\"\\r\\n\"No - really - I don\\'t think I\\'ll come. You two hurry up, you re\\r\\nwasting time\\r\\nHarry looked at Ron, bewildered.\\r\\n\"That looks more like Goyle,\" said Ron. \"That\\'s how he looks every\\r\\ntime a teacher asks him a question.\"\\r\\n\"Hermione, are you okay?\" said Harry through the door.\\r\\n\"Fine - I\\'m fine - go on -\"\\r\\nHarry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty minutes had\\r\\nalready passed.\\r\\n\"We\\'ll meet you back here, all right?\" he said.\\r\\nHarry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked\\r\\nthat the coast was clear, and set off.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t swing your arms like that,\" Harry muttered to Ron.\\r\\n186\\r\\n\"Eh?\"\\r\\n\"Crabbe holds them sort of stiff . . . .\"\\r\\n\"How\\'s this?\"\\r\\n\"Yeah, that\\'s better . . . .\"\\r\\nThey went down the marble staircase. All they needed now was\\r\\n*218*\\r\\na Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but\\r\\nthere was nobody around.\\r\\n\"Any ideas?\" muttered Harry.\\r\\n\"The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,\" said\\r\\nRon, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons. The words had barely\\r\\nleft his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the\\r\\nentrance.\\r\\n\"Excuse me,\" said Ron, hurrying up to her. \"We\\'ve forgotten the way\\r\\nto our common room.\"\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said the girl stiffly. \"Our common room? I\\'m a\\r\\nRavenclaw.\"\\r\\nShe walked away, looking suspiciously back at them.\\r\\nHarry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their\\r\\nfootsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe\\'s and Goyle\\'s huge\\r\\nfeet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn\\'t going to be as easy as they\\r\\nhad hoped.\\r\\nThe labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked deeper and\\r\\ndeeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to see\\r\\nhow much time they had left. After a quarter of an hour, just when\\r\\nthey were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead.\\r\\n\"Ha!\" said Ron excitedly. \"There\\'s one of them now!\"\\r\\n187\\r\\nThe figure was emerging from a side room. As they hurried nearer,\\r\\nhowever, their hearts sank. It wasn\\'t a Slytherin, it was Percy.\\r\\n\"What\\'re you doing down here?\" said Ron in surprise.\\r\\nPercy looked affronted.\\r\\n\"That,\" he said stiffly, \"is none of your business. It\\'s Crabbe, isn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n2 19\\r\\n\"Wh - oh, yeah,\" said Ron.\\r\\n\"Well, get off to your dormitories,\" said Percy sternly. \"It\\'s not safe to\\r\\ngo wandering around dark corridors these days.\"\\r\\n\"You are,\" Ron pointed out.\\r\\n\"I,\" said Percy, drawing himself up, \"am a prefect. Nothing\\'s about to\\r\\nattack me.\"\\r\\nA voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron. Draco Malfoy was\\r\\nstrolling toward them, and for the first time in his life, Harry was\\r\\npleased to see him.\\r\\n\"There you are,\" he drawled, looking at them. \"Have you two been\\r\\npigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I\\'ve been looking for you; I\\r\\nwant to show you something really funny.\"\\r\\nMalfoy glanced witheringly at Percy.\\r\\n\"And what\\'re you doing down here, Weasley?\" he sneered.\\r\\nPercy looked outraged.\\r\\n\"You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect!\" he said. \"I\\r\\ndon\\'t like your attitude!\"\\r\\nMalfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him. Harry\\r\\nalmost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in\\r\\ntime. He and Ron hurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into\\r\\n188\\r\\nthe next passage, \"That Peter Weasley -\"\\r\\n\"Percy,\" Ron corrected him automatically.\\r\\n\"Whatever,\" said Malfoy. \"I\\'ve noticed him sneaking around a lot\\r\\nlately. And I bet I know what he\\'s up to. He thinks he\\'s going to catch\\r\\nSlytherin\\'s heir single-handed.\"\\r\\nHe gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron exchanged excited\\r\\nlooks.\\r\\nMalfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall.\\r\\n* 220 *\\r\\n\"What\\'s the new password again?\" he said to Harry.\\r\\n\"Er -\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Oh, yeah -pure-blood!\" said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone door\\r\\nconcealed in the wall slid open. Malfoy marched through it, and\\r\\nHarry and Ron followed him.\\r\\nThe Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room\\r\\nwith rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps\\r\\nwere hanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately\\r\\ncarved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several Slytherins were\\r\\nsilhouetted around it in high-backed chairs.\\r\\n\"Wait here,\" said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning them to a pair\\r\\nof empty chairs set back from the fire. \"I\\'ll go and get it my father\\'s\\r\\njust sent it to me -\"\\r\\nWondering what Malfoy was going to show them, Harry and Ron\\r\\nsat down, doing their best to look at home.\\r\\nMalfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked like a\\r\\nnewspaper clipping. He thrust it under Ron\\'s nose.\\r\\n\"That\\'ll give you a laugh,\" he said.\\r\\nHarry saw Ron\\'s eyes widen in shock. He read the clipping quickly,\\r\\n189\\r\\ngave a very forced laugh, and handed it to Harry.\\r\\nIt had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and it said:\\r\\nINQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC\\r\\nArthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office,\\r\\nwas today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car.\\r\\nMr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft\\r\\nand Wizardry, where the\\r\\n221\\r\\nenchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for Mr.\\r\\nWeasley\\'s resignation.\\r\\n\"Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,\" Mr. Malfoy told our\\r\\nreporter. \"He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous\\r\\nMuggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately.\"\\r\\nMr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife told\\r\\nreporters to clear off or she\\'d set the family ghoul on them.\\r\\n\"Well?\" said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the clipping back to\\r\\nhim. \"Don\\'t you think it\\'s funny?\"\\r\\n\"Ha, ha,\" said Harry bleakly.\\r\\n\"Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in\\r\\nhalf and go and join them,\" said Malfoy scornfully. \"You\\'d never know\\r\\nthe Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave.\"\\r\\nRon\\'s - or rather, Crabbe\\'s - face was contorted with fury.\\r\\n\"What\\'s up with you, Crabbe?\" snapped Malfoy.\\r\\n\"Stomachache,\" Ron grunted.\\r\\n\"Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick\\r\\nfrom me,\" said Malfoy, snickering. \"You know, I\\'m surprised the Daily\\r\\nProphet hasn\\'t reported all these attacks yet,\" he went on thoughtfully.\\r\\n190\\r\\n\"I suppose Dumbledore\\'s trying to hush it all up. He\\'ll be sacked if it\\r\\ndoesn\\'t stop soon. Father\\'s always said old Dumbledore\\'s the worst\\r\\nthing that\\'s ever happened to this place. He loves Muggle-borns. A\\r\\ndecent headmaster would never\\'ve let slime like that Creevey in.\"\\r\\n*222*\\r\\nMalfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a\\r\\ncruel but accurate impression of Colin: \"`Potter, can I have your\\r\\npicture, Potter? Can I have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes,\\r\\nplease, Potter?\"\\'\\r\\nHe dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron.\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter with you two?\"\\r\\nFar too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh, but Malfoy\\r\\nseemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on\\r\\nthe uptake.\\r\\n\"Saint Potter, the Mudbloods\\' friend,\" said Malfoy slowly. \"He\\'s\\r\\nanother one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn\\'t go around\\r\\nwith that jumped up Granger Mudblood. And people think he\\'s\\r\\nSlytherin\\'s heir!\"\\r\\nHarry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely seconds\\r\\naway from telling them it was him - but then\\r\\n\"I wish I knew who it is,\" said Malfoy petulantly. \"I could help them.\"\\r\\nRon\\'s jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than\\r\\nusual. Fortunately, Malfoy didn\\'t notice, and Harry, thinking fast,\\r\\nsaid, \"You must have some idea who\\'s behind it all ......\\r\\n\"You know I haven\\'t, Goyle, how many times do I have to tell you?\"\\r\\nsnapped Malfoy. \"And Father won\\'t tell me anything about the last\\r\\ntime the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty years\\r\\nago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says\\r\\nthat it was all kept quiet and it\\'ll look suspicious if I know too much\\r\\nabout it. But I know one thing - last time the Chamber of Secrets\\r\\nwas opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it\\'s a matter of time before\\r\\none of them\\'s killed this time .... I hope it\\'s Granger,\" he said with\\r\\n191\\r\\nrelish.\\r\\nRon was clenching Crabbe\\'s gigantic fists. Feeling that it would be a\\r\\nbit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning\\r\\nlook and said, \"D\\'you know if the person who opened the Chamber\\r\\nlast time was caught?\"\\r\\n\"Oh, yeah ... whoever it was was expelled,\" said Malfoy. \"They\\'re\\r\\nprobably still in Azkaban.\"\\r\\n\"Azkaban?\" said Harry, puzzled.\\r\\n\"Azkaban - the wizard prison, Goyle,\" said Malfoy, looking at him in\\r\\ndisbelief \"Honestly, if you were any slower, you\\'d be going\\r\\nbackward.\"\\r\\nHe shifted restlessly in his chair and said, \"Father says to keep my\\r\\nhead down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it. He says the\\r\\nschool needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed\\r\\nup in it. Of course, he\\'s got a lot on his plate at the moment. You\\r\\nknow the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week?\"\\r\\nHarry tried to force Goyle\\'s dull face into a look of concern.\\r\\n\"Yeah. . .\" said Malfoy. \"Luckily, they didn\\'t find much. Father\\'s got\\r\\nsome very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But luckily, we\\'ve got our own\\r\\nsecret chamber under the drawing-room floor\\r\\n-\"\\r\\n\"Ho!\" said Ron.\\r\\nMalfoy looked at him. So did Harry. Ron blushed. Even his hair was\\r\\nturning red. His nose was also slowly lengthening - their hour was\\r\\nup, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror\\r\\nhe was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too.\\r\\nThey both jumped to their feet.\\r\\n\"Medicine for my stomach,\" Ron grunted, and without further ado\\r\\nthey sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurled\\r\\nthemselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping\\r\\n192\\r\\nagainst hope that Malfoy hadn\\'t noticed anything. Harry\\r\\n224\\r\\ncould feel his feet slipping around in Goyle\\'s huge shoes and had to\\r\\nhoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the steps into the dark\\r\\nentrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the\\r\\ncloset where they\\'d locked Crabbe and Goyle. Leaving their shoes\\r\\noutside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up the marble\\r\\nstaircase toward Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom.\\r\\n\"Well, it wasn\\'t a complete waste of time,\" Ron panted, closing the\\r\\nbathroom door behind them. \"I know we still haven\\'t found out who\\'s\\r\\ndoing the attacks, but I\\'m going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him\\r\\nto check under the Malfoys\\' drawing room.\"\\r\\nHarry checked his face in the cracked mirror. He was back to normal.\\r\\nHe put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Hermione\\'s\\r\\nstall.\\r\\n\"Hermione, come out, we\\'ve got loads to tell you -\"\\r\\n\"Go away!\" Hermione squeaked.\\r\\nHarry and Ron looked at each other.\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" said Ron. \"You must be back to normal by now,\\r\\nwe are\\r\\nBut Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door. Harry had\\r\\nnever seen her looking so happy.\\r\\n\"Ooooooh, wait till you see,\" she said. \"It\\'s awful-\"\\r\\nThey heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged, sobbing, her\\r\\nrobes pulled up over her head.\\r\\n\"What\\'s up?\" said Ron uncertainly. \"Have you still got Millicent\\'s nose\\r\\nor something?\"\\r\\nHermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink.\\r\\n193\\r\\nHer face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had turned yellow and\\r\\nthere were long, pointed ears poking through her hair.\\r\\n\"It was a c-cat hair!\" she howled. \"M-Millicent Bulstrode\\r\\n*225*\\r\\nm-must have a cat! And the p-potion isn\\'t supposed to be used for\\r\\nanimal transformations!\"\\r\\n\"Uh-oh,\" said Ron.\\r\\n\"You\\'ll be teased something dreadful,\" said Myrtle happily.\\r\\n\"It\\'s okay, Hermione,\" said Harry quickly. \"We\\'ll take you up to the\\r\\nhospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions ......\\r\\nIt took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom.\\r\\nMoaning Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw. \"Wait\\r\\ntill everyone finds out you\\'ve got a tail!\"\\r\\nermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks. There was a\\r\\nflurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school\\r\\narrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course\\r\\neveryone thought that she had been attacked. So many students filed\\r\\npast the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam\\r\\nPomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around\\r\\nHermione\\'s bed, to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry\\r\\nface.\\r\\nHarry and Ron went to visit her every evening. When the new term\\r\\nstarted, they brought her each day\\'s homework.\\r\\n\"If Id sprouted whiskers, Id take a break from work,\" said Ron, tipping\\r\\na stack of books onto Hermione\\'s bedside table one evening.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be silly, Ron, I\\'ve got to keep up,\" said Hermione briskly. Her\\r\\nspirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had\\r\\n* \"21 *\\r\\n194\\r\\ngone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t suppose you\\'ve got any new leads?\" she added in a whisper,\\r\\nso that Madam Pomfrey couldn\\'t hear her.\\r\\n\"Nothing,\" said Harry gloomily.\\r\\n\"I was so sure it was Malfoy,\" said Ron, for about the hundredth time.\\r\\n\"What\\'s that?\" asked Harry, pointing to something gold sticking out\\r\\nfrom under Hermione\\'s pillow.\\r\\n\"Just a get well card,\" said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of\\r\\nsight, but Ron was too quick for her. He pulled it out, flicked it open,\\r\\nand read aloud:\\r\\n\"To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned\\r\\nteacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class,\\r\\nHonorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner\\r\\nof Witch Weekly\\'s Most- Charming-Smile Award. \"\\r\\nRon looked up at Hermione, disgusted.\\r\\n\"You sleep with this under your pillow?\"\\r\\nBut Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping\\r\\nover with her evening dose of medicine.\\r\\n\"Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you\\'ve ever met, or what?\" Ron\\r\\nsaid to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs\\r\\ntoward Gryffindor Tower. Snape had given them so much\\r\\nhomework, Harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before\\r\\nhe finished it. Ron was just saying he wished he had asked Hermione\\r\\nhow many rat tails you were supposed to add to a HairRaising\\r\\nPotion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their\\r\\nears.\\r\\n\"That\\'s Filch,\" Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and\\r\\npaused, out of sight, listening hard.\\r\\n* 228*\\r\\n195\\r\\n\"You don\\'t think someone else\\'s been attacked?\" said Ron tensely.\\r\\nThey stood still, their heads inclined toward Flich\\'s voice, which\\r\\nsounded quite hysterical.\\r\\n`= even more work for me! Mopping all night, like I haven\\'t got enough to\\r\\ndo! No, this is the final straw, I\\'m going to Dumbledore -\"\\r\\nHis footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard a\\r\\ndistant door slam.\\r\\nThey poked their heads around the corner. Filch had clearly been\\r\\nmanning his usual lookout post: They were once again on the spot\\r\\nwhere Mrs. Norris had been attacked. They saw at a glance what\\r\\nFilch had been shouting about. A great flood of water stretched over\\r\\nhalf the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping from\\r\\nunder the door of Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. Now that Filch had\\r\\nstopped shouting, they could hear Myrtle\\'s wails echoing off the\\r\\nbathroom walls.\\r\\n\"Now what\\'s up with her?\" said Ron.\\r\\n\"Let\\'s go and see,\" said Harry, and holding their robes over their\\r\\nankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door\\r\\nbearing its OUT OF ORDER sign, ignored it as always, and entered.\\r\\nMoaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and harder than ever\\r\\nbefore. She seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet. It was dark in\\r\\nthe bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great\\r\\nrush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet.\\r\\n\"What\\'s up, Myrtle?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Who\\'s that?\" glugged Myrtle miserably. \"Come to throw something\\r\\nelse at me?\"\\r\\nHarry waded across to her stall and said, \"Why would I throw\\r\\nsomething at you?\"\\r\\n*229*\\r\\n\"Don\\'t ask me,\" Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave of yet more\\r\\n196\\r\\nwater, which splashed onto the already sopping floor. \"Here I am,\\r\\nminding my own business, and someone thinks it\\'s funny to throw a\\r\\nbook at me ......\\r\\n\"But it can\\'t hurt you if someone throws something at you,\" said\\r\\nHarry, reasonably. \"I mean, it\\'d just go right through you, wouldn\\'t\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\nHe had said the wrong thing. Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked,\\r\\n\"Let\\'s all throw books at Myrtle, because she can\\'t feel it! Ten points\\r\\nif you can get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through\\r\\nher head! Well, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don\\'t think!\"\\r\\n\"Who threw it at you, anyway?\" asked Harry.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know... I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about\\r\\ndeath, and it fell right through the top of my head,\" said Myrtle,\\r\\nglaring at them. \"It\\'s over there, it got washed out ......\\r\\nHarry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing. A\\r\\nsmall, thin book lay there. It had a shabby black cover and was as\\r\\nwet as everything else in the bathroom. Harry stepped forward to\\r\\npick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back.\\r\\n\"What?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Are you crazy?\" said Ron. \"It could be dangerous.\"\\r\\n\"Dangerous?\"said Harry, laughing. \"Come off it, how could it be\\r\\ndangerous?\"\\r\\n\"You\\'d be surprised,\" said Ron, who was looking apprehensively at\\r\\nthe book. \"Some of the books the Ministry\\'s confiscated Dad\\'s told\\r\\nme - there was one that burned your eyes out. And\\r\\n*2%0*\\r\\neveryone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest\\r\\nof their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could\\r\\nnever stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it,\\r\\ntrying to do everything one-handed. And -\"\\r\\n197\\r\\n\"All right, I\\'ve got the point,\" said Harry.\\r\\nThe little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy.\\r\\n\"Well, we won\\'t find out unless we look at it,\" he said, and he ducked\\r\\naround Ron and picked it up off the floor.\\r\\nHarry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover\\r\\ntold him it was fifty years old. He opened it eagerly. On the first page\\r\\nhe could just make out the name \"T M. Riddle\" in smudged ink.\\r\\n\"Hang on,\" said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was looking\\r\\nover Harry\\'s shoulder. \"I know that name .... T. M. Riddle got an\\r\\naward for special services to the school fifty years ago.\"\\r\\n\"How on earth d\\'you know that?\" said Harry in amazement.\\r\\n\"Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in\\r\\ndetention,\" said Ron resentfully. \"That was the one I burped slugs all\\r\\nover. If you\\'d wiped slime off a name for an hour, you\\'d remember it,\\r\\ntoo.\"\\r\\nHarry peeled the wet pages apart. They were completely blank.\\r\\nThere wasn\\'t the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even\\r\\nAuntie Mabel\\'s birthday, or dentist, half-past three.\\r\\n\"He never wrote in it,\" said Harry, disappointed.\\r\\n\"I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?\" said Ron curiously.\\r\\nHarry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name\\r\\nof a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London.\\r\\n*231 *\\r\\n\"He must\\'ve been Muggle-born,\" said Harry thoughtfufly. \"To have\\r\\nbought a diary from Vauxhall Road ......\\r\\n\"Well, it\\'s not much use to you,\" said Ron. He dropped his voice. \"Fifty\\r\\npoints if you can get it through Myrtle\\'s nose.\"\\r\\nHarry, however, pocketed it.\\r\\n198\\r\\nHermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less, and furfree, at\\r\\nthe beginning of February. On her first evening back in Gryffindor\\r\\nTower, Harry showed her T. M. Riddle\\'s diary and told her the story\\r\\nof how they had found it.\\r\\n\"Oooh, it might have hidden powers,\" said Hermione enthusiastically,\\r\\ntaking the diary and looking at it closely.\\r\\n\"If it has, it\\'s hiding them very well,\" said Ron. \"Maybe it\\'s shy. I don\\'t\\r\\nknow why you don\\'t chuck it, Harry.\"\\r\\n\"I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,\" said Harry. \"I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services\\r\\nto Hogwarts either.\"\\r\\n\"Could\\'ve been anything,\" said Ron. \"Maybe he got thirty O.WL.s or\\r\\nsaved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that\\r\\nwould\\'ve done everyone a favor .....\\r\\nBut Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione\\'s face that\\r\\nshe was thinking what he was thinking.\\r\\n\"What?\" said Ron, looking from one to the other.\\r\\n\"Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn\\'t it?\"\\r\\nhe said. \"That\\'s what Malfoy said.\"\\r\\n\"Yeah. . .\" said Ron slowly.\\r\\n\"And this diary is fifty years old,\" said Hermione, tapping it excitedly.\\r\\n*232*\\r\\na so?\\r\\n.\\r\\n\"Oh, Ron, wake up,\" snapped Hermione. \"We know the person who\\r\\nopened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. We know\\r\\nT. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years\\r\\nago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of\\r\\n199\\r\\nSlytherin? His diary would probably tell us everything - where the\\r\\nChamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it -\\r\\nthe person who\\'s behind the attacks this time wouldn\\'t want that lying\\r\\naround, would they?\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s a brilliant theory, Hermione,\" said Ron, \"with just one tiny little\\r\\nflaw. There\\'s nothing written in his diary.\"\\r\\nBut Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag.\\r\\n\"It might be invisible ink!\" she whispered.\\r\\nShe tapped the diary three times and said, \"Aparecium!\"\\r\\nNothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into\\r\\nher bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser.\\r\\n\"It\\'s a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,\" she said.\\r\\nShe rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened.\\r\\n\"I\\'m telling you, there\\'s nothing to find in there,\" said Ron. \"Riddle just\\r\\ngot a diary for Christmas and couldn\\'t be bothered filling it in.\"\\r\\nHarry couldn\\'t explain, even to himself, why he didn\\'t just throw\\r\\nRiddle\\'s diary away. The fact was that even though he knew the diary\\r\\nwas blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages,\\r\\nas though it were a story he wanted to finish. And while Harry was\\r\\nsure he had never heard the name T. M. Riddle before, it still seemed\\r\\nto mean something to him, almost as though\\r\\n* 233 *\\r\\nRiddle was a friend he\\'d had when he was very small, and had\\r\\nhalfforgotten. But this was absurd. He\\'d never had friends before\\r\\nHogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that.\\r\\nNevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so\\r\\nnext day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle\\'s\\r\\nspecial award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a\\r\\nthoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he\\'d seen enough of the\\r\\ntrophy room to last him a lifetime.\\r\\n200\\r\\nRiddle\\'s burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. It\\r\\ndidn\\'t carry details of why it had been given to him (\"Good thing, too,\\r\\nor it\\'d be even bigger and Id still be polishing it,\" said Ron). However,\\r\\nthey did find Riddle\\'s name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on\\r\\na list of old Head Boys.\\r\\n\"He sounds like Percy,\" said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust.\\r\\n\"Prefect, Head Boy ... probably top of every class -\"\\r\\n\"You say that like it\\'s a bad thing,\" said Hermione in a slightly hurt\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\nThe sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. Inside\\r\\nthe castle, the mood had grown more hopeful. There had been no\\r\\nmore attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and\\r\\nMadam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were\\r\\nbecoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving\\r\\nchildhood.\\r\\n\"The moment their acne clears up, they\\'ll be ready for repotting again,\"\\r\\nHarry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. \"And after that, it\\r\\nwon\\'t be long until we\\'re cutting them up and stewing them. You\\'ll\\r\\nhave Mrs. Norris back in no time.\"\\r\\n* 243 *\\r\\nPerhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry.\\r\\nIt must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets,\\r\\nwith the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster,\\r\\nwhatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate for\\r\\nanother fifty years ....\\r\\nErnie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn\\'t take this cheerful view. He was\\r\\nstill convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had \"given\\r\\nhimself away\" at the Dueling Club. Peeves wasn\\'t helping matters; he\\r\\nkept popping up in the crowded corridors singing \"Oh, Potter, you\\r\\nrotter . . .\" now with a dance routine to match.\\r\\nGilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks\\r\\nstop. Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while the\\r\\nGryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration.\\r\\n201\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think there\\'ll be any more trouble, Minerva,\" he said, tapping\\r\\nhis nose knowingly and winking. \"I think the Chamber has been locked\\r\\nfor good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter\\r\\nof time before I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before I\\r\\ncame down hard on him.\\r\\n\"You know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. Wash\\r\\naway the memories of last term! I won\\'t say any more just now, but I\\r\\nthink I know just the thing . . . .\"\\r\\nHe tapped his nose again and strode off.\\r\\nLockhart\\'s idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on\\r\\nFebruary fourteenth. Harry hadn\\'t had much sleep because of a laterunning\\r\\nQuidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to\\r\\nthe Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment, that he\\'d\\r\\nwalked through the wrong doors.\\r\\nThe walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse\\r\\n* 235*\\r\\nstill, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry\\r\\nwent over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking\\r\\nsickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles.\\r\\n\"What\\'s going on?\" Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti\\r\\noff his bacon.\\r\\nRon pointed to the teachers\\' table, apparently too disgusted to speak.\\r\\nLockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was\\r\\nwaving for silence. The teachers on either side of him were looking\\r\\nstony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall\\'s cheek. Snape looked as though someone had\\r\\njust fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro.\\r\\n\"Happy Valentine\\'s Day!\" Lockhart shouted. \"And may I thank the\\r\\nforty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the\\r\\nliberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn\\'t end\\r\\nhere!\"\\r\\n202\\r\\nLockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall\\r\\nmarched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however.\\r\\nLockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps.\\r\\n\"My friendly, card-carrying cupids!\" beamed Lockhart. \"They will be\\r\\nroving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fun\\r\\ndoesn\\'t stop here! I\\'m sure my colleagues will want to enter into the\\r\\nspirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how\\r\\nto whip up a Love Potion! And while you\\'re at it, Professor Flitwick\\r\\nknows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I\\'ve\\r\\never met, the sly old dog!\"\\r\\nProfessor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was look\\r\\n* 236\\r\\ning as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be\\r\\nforce-fed poison.\\r\\n\"Please, Hermione, tell me you weren\\'t one of the forty-six, 51 said Ron\\r\\nas they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly\\r\\nbecame very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and\\r\\ndidn\\'t answer.\\r\\nAll day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver\\r\\nvalentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as\\r\\nthe Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs\\r\\ncaught up with Harry.\\r\\n\"Oy, you! \\'Arty Potter!\" shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf,\\r\\nelbowing people out of the way to get to Harry.\\r\\nHot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line\\r\\nof first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried\\r\\nto escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by\\r\\nkicking people\\'s shins, and reached him before he\\'d gone two paces.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got a musical message to deliver to \\'Arry Potter in person,\" he\\r\\nsaid, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way.\\r\\n\"Not here,\" Harry hissed, trying to escape.\\r\\n203\\r\\n\"Stay still!\" grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry\\'s bag and pulling\\r\\nhim back.\\r\\n\"Let me go!\" Harry snarled, tugging.\\r\\nWith a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His books, wand,\\r\\nparchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed\\r\\nover everything.\\r\\nHarry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf\\r\\nstarted singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor.\\r\\n*237*\\r\\n\"What\\'s going on here?\" came the cold, drawling voice of Draco\\r\\nMalfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped\\r\\nbag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical\\r\\nvalentine.\\r\\n\"What\\'s all this commotion?\" said another familiar voice as Percy\\r\\nWeasley arrived.\\r\\nLosing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf\\r\\nseized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.\\r\\n\"Right,\" he said, sitting on Harry\\'s ankles. \"Here is your singing\\r\\nvalentine:\\r\\nHis eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,\\r\\nHis hair is as dark as a blackboard.\\r\\nI wish he was mine, he\\'s really divine,\\r\\nThe hero who conquered the Dark Lord\\r\\nHarry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the\\r\\nspot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his\\r\\nfeet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his\\r\\nbest to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth.\\r\\n\"Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class,\\r\\nnow,\" he said, shooing some of the younger students away. \"And you,\\r\\nMalfoy-\"\\r\\n204\\r\\nHarry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something.\\r\\nLeering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that\\r\\nhe\\'d got Riddle\\'s diary.\\r\\n\"Give that back,\" said Harry quietly.\\r\\n\"Wonder what Potter\\'s written in this?\" said Malfoy, who obvi\\r\\n* 238\\r\\nously hadn\\'t noticed the year on the cover and thought he had\\r\\nHarry\\'s own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring\\r\\nfrom the diary to Harry, looking terrified.\\r\\n\"Hand it over, Malfoy,\" said Percy sternly.\\r\\n\"When I\\'ve had a look,\" said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\nPercy said, \"As a school prefect -\" but Harry had lost his temper. He\\r\\npulled out his wand and shouted, \"Expelliarmus!\" and just as\\r\\nSnape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting\\r\\nout of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.\\r\\n\"Harry!\" said Percy loudly. \"No magic in the corridors. I\\'ll have to\\r\\nreport this, you know!\"\\r\\nBut Harry didn\\'t care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth\\r\\nfive points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, and\\r\\nas Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after\\r\\nher, \"I don\\'t think Potter liked your valentine much!\"\\r\\nGinny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling,\\r\\nRon pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away. Ron didn\\'t\\r\\nneed to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs.\\r\\nIt wasn\\'t until they had reached Professor Flitwick\\'s class that Harry\\r\\nnoticed something rather odd about Riddle\\'s diary. All his other\\r\\nbooks were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as\\r\\nclean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He\\r\\ntried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his\\r\\n205\\r\\nwand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end,\\r\\nand he wasn\\'t much interested in anything else.\\r\\nHarry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This\\r\\nwas partly because he didn\\'t think he could stand Fred and George\\r\\nsinging, \"His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad\" one more time,\\r\\nand partly because he wanted to examine Riddle\\'s diary again, and\\r\\nknew that Ron thought he was wasting his time.\\r\\nHarry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not\\r\\none of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new\\r\\nbottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a\\r\\nblot onto the first page of the diary.\\r\\nThe ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it\\r\\nwas being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up\\r\\nhis quill a second time and wrote, \"My name is Harry Potter.\"\\r\\nThe words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without\\r\\ntrace. Then, at last, something happened.\\r\\nOozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry\\r\\nhad never written.\\r\\n\"Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by my\\r\\ndiary?\"\\r\\nThese words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to\\r\\nscribble back.\\r\\n\"Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.\"\\r\\nHe waited eagerly for Riddle\\'s reply.\\r\\n\"Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink.\\r\\nBut I always knew that there would be those who would not want this\\r\\ndiary read. \"\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his\\r\\nexcitement.\\r\\n*240*\\r\\n206\\r\\n`I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were\\r\\ncovered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and\\r\\nWizardry. \"\\r\\n\"That\\'s where I am now,\" Harry wrote quickly. \"I\\'m at Hogwarts, and\\r\\nhorrible stuff\\'s been happening. Do you know anything about the\\r\\nChamber of Secrets?\"\\r\\nHis heart was hammering. Riddle\\'s reply came quickly, his writing\\r\\nbecoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.\\r\\n\"Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it\\r\\nwas a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the\\r\\nChamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally\\r\\nkilling one. I caught the person whod opened the Chamber and he was\\r\\nexpelled. But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing\\r\\nhad happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given\\r\\nout that thegirl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny,\\r\\nengraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I\\r\\nknew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the\\r\\npower to release it was not imprisoned. \"\\r\\nHarry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.\\r\\n\"It\\'s happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one\\r\\nseems to know who\\'s behind them. Who was it last time?\"\\r\\n\"I can show you, if you like, \"came Riddle\\'s reply. \"You don\\'t have\\r\\nto take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night\\r\\nwhen I caught him. \"\\r\\nHarry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle\\r\\nmean? How could he be taken inside somebody else\\'s memory? He\\r\\nglanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was\\r\\n*241*\\r\\ngrowing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words\\r\\nforming.\\r\\n207\\r\\n\"Let me show you. \"\\r\\nHarry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters.\\r\\n(40K.55\\r\\nThe pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind,\\r\\nstopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open,\\r\\nHarry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have\\r\\nturned into a miniscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly,\\r\\nhe raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and\\r\\nbefore he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the\\r\\nwindow was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was\\r\\npitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color\\r\\nand shadow.\\r\\nHe felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred\\r\\nshapes around him came suddenly into focus.\\r\\nHe knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the\\r\\nsleeping portraits was Dumbledore\\'s office - but it wasn\\'t Dumbledore\\r\\nwho was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, fraillooking wizard, bald\\r\\nexcept for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by\\r\\ncandlelight. Harry had never seen this man before.\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" he said shakily. \"I didn\\'t mean to butt in -\"\\r\\nBut the wizard didn\\'t look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly.\\r\\nHarry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, \"Er - I\\'ll just go, shall\\r\\nI?\"\\r\\nStill the wizard ignored him. He didn\\'t seem even to have heard him.\\r\\nThinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice.\\r\\n*242*\\r\\n\"Sorry I disturbed you. I\\'ll go now,\" he half-shouted.\\r\\nThe wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past\\r\\nHarry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his\\r\\nwindow.\\r\\n208\\r\\nThe sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset.\\r\\nThe wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs,\\r\\nwatching the door.\\r\\nHarry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirring\\r\\nsilver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it,\\r\\nmeaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore,\\r\\nand he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to\\r\\nthe people of fifty years ago.\\r\\nThere was a knock on the office door.\\r\\n\"Enter,\" said the old wizard in a feeble voice.\\r\\nA boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver\\r\\nprefect\\'s badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than\\r\\nHarry, but he, too, had jet-black hair.\\r\\n\"Ah, Riddle,\" said the Headmaster.\\r\\n\"You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?\" said Riddle. He looked\\r\\nnervous.\\r\\n\"Sit down,\" said Dippet. \"I\\'ve just been reading the letter you sent me.\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very\\r\\ntightly.\\r\\n\"My dear boy,\" said Dipper kindly, \"I cannot possibly let you stay at\\r\\nschool over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the\\r\\nholidays?\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Riddle at once. \"Id much rather stay at Hogwarts than go\\r\\nback to that - to that -\"\\r\\n* 243*\\r\\n\"You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?\" said\\r\\nDippet curiously.\\r\\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle, reddening slightly.\\r\\n209\\r\\n\"You are Muggle-born?\"\\r\\n\"Half-blood, sir,\" said Riddle. \"Muggle father, witch mother.\"\\r\\n\"And are both your parents -?\"\\r\\n\"My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the\\r\\norphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after my\\r\\nfather, Marvolo after my grandfather.\"\\r\\nDipper clucked his tongue sympathetically.\\r\\n\"The thing is, Tom,\" he sighed, \"Special arrangements might have\\r\\nbeen made for you, but in the current circumstances . . . .\"\\r\\n\"You mean all these attacks, sir?\" said Riddle, and Harry\\'s heart\\r\\nleapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything.\\r\\n\"Precisely,\" said the headmaster. \"My dear boy, you must see how\\r\\nfoolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when\\r\\nterm ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy ... the death of\\r\\nthat poor little girl .... You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As\\r\\na matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about\\r\\nclosing the school. We are no nearer locating the er - source of all\\r\\nthis unpleasantness . . . .\"\\r\\nRiddle\\'s eyes had widened.\\r\\n\"Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped -\"\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting\\r\\nup in his chair. \"Riddle, do you mean you know something about\\r\\nthese attacks?\"\\r\\n\"No, sir,\" said Riddle quickly.\\r\\nBut Harry was sure it was the same sort of \"no\" that he himself had\\r\\ngiven Dumbledore.\\r\\n*244*\\r\\nDippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed.\\r\\n210\\r\\n\"You may go, Tom ......\\r\\nRiddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Harry\\r\\nfollowed him.\\r\\nDown the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the\\r\\ngargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so did\\r\\nHarry, watching him. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some\\r\\nserious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.\\r\\nThen, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off,\\r\\nHarry gliding noiselessly behind him. They didn\\'t see another person\\r\\nuntil they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long,\\r\\nsweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble\\r\\nstaircase.\\r\\n\"What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?\"\\r\\nHarry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-yearyounger\\r\\nDumbledore.\\r\\n\"I had to see the headmaster, sir,\" said Riddle.\\r\\n\"Well, hurry off to bed,\" said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly the\\r\\nkind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. \"Best not to roam the\\r\\ncorridors these days. Not since . . .\"\\r\\nHe sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddle\\r\\nwatched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed\\r\\nstraight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot\\r\\npursuit.\\r\\nBut to Harry\\'s disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hidden\\r\\npassageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which\\r\\nHarry had Potions with Snape. The torches hadn\\'t been lit, and when\\r\\nRiddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just\\r\\n*2 45 *\\r\\nsee him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside.\\r\\n211\\r\\nIt felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he could\\r\\nsee was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack,\\r\\nwaiting like a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feeling\\r\\nexpectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present,\\r\\nhe heard something move beyond the door.\\r\\nSomeone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it was\\r\\npass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a\\r\\nshadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind\\r\\nhim, forgetting that he couldn\\'t be heard.\\r\\nFor perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddle\\r\\nstopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises.\\r\\nHarry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a\\r\\nhoarse whisper.\\r\\n\"C\\'mon ... gotta get yeh outta here .... C\\'mon now ... in the box. . .\"\\r\\nThere was something familiar about that voice ....\\r\\nRiddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped out behind\\r\\nhim. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching\\r\\nin front of an open door, a very large box next to it.\\r\\n\"Evening, Rubeus,\" said Riddle sharply.\\r\\nThe boy slammed the door shut and stood up.\\r\\n\"What yer doin\\' down here, Tom?\"\\r\\nRiddle stepped closer.\\r\\n\"It\\'s all over,\" he said. \"I\\'m going to have to turn you in, Rubeus.\\r\\nThey\\'re talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don\\'t stop.\"\\r\\n4 6\\r\\n\"N\" at d\\'yeh -\"\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don\\'t make\\r\\ngood pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and -\"\\r\\n212\\r\\n\"It never killed no one!\" said the large boy, backing against the\\r\\nclosed door. From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and\\r\\nclicking.\\r\\n\"Come on, Rubeus,\" said Riddle, moving yet closer. \"The dead girl\\'s\\r\\nparents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make\\r\\nsure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered ......\\r\\n\"It wasn\\'t him!\" roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark\\r\\npassage. \"He wouldn\\'! He never!\"\\r\\n\"Stand aside,\" said Riddle, drawing out his wand.\\r\\nHis spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind\\r\\nthe large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall\\r\\nopposite. And out of it came something that made Harry let out a\\r\\nlong, piercing scream unheard by anyone\\r\\nA vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of\\r\\nmany eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers - Riddle raised his\\r\\nwand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it\\r\\nscuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle\\r\\nscrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the\\r\\nhuge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down,\\r\\nyelling, \"NO000000!\"\\r\\nThe scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself\\r\\nfalling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster\\r\\nin the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle\\'s diary lying open on his stomach.\\r\\n*24 7*\\r\\nBefore he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door\\r\\nopened and Ron came in.\\r\\n\"There you are,\" he said.\\r\\nHarry sat up. He was sweating and shaking.\\r\\n\"What\\'s up?\" said Ron, looking at him with concern.\\r\\n\"It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty\\r\\n213\\r\\nyears ago.\"\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an\\r\\nunfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first\\r\\nyear at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden\\r\\nhouse, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, threeheaded\\r\\ndog he\\'d christened \"Fluffy.\" And if, as a boy, Hagrid had\\r\\nheard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was\\r\\nsure he\\'d have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He\\'d probably\\r\\nthought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so\\r\\nlong, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs;\\r\\nHarry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a\\r\\nleash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Hagrid would\\r\\nnever have meant to kill anybody.\\r\\nHarry half wished he hadn\\'t found out how to work Riddle\\'s diary.\\r\\nAgain and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what\\r\\nhe\\'d seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the\\r\\nlong, circular conversations that followed.\\r\\n\"Riddle might have got the wrong person,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe it\\r\\nwas some other monster that was attacking people . . . .\"\\r\\n\"How many monsters d\\'you think this place can hold?\" Ron asked\\r\\ndully.\\r\\n\"We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,\" said Harry miserably.\\r\\n\"And the attacks must\\'ve stopped after Hagrid was kicked out.\\r\\nOtherwise, Riddle wouldn\\'t have got his award.\"\\r\\nRon tried a different tack.\\r\\n\"Riddle does sound like Percy - who asked him to squeal on Hagrid,\\r\\nanyway?\"\\r\\n\"But the monster had killed someone, Ron,\" said Hermione.\\r\\n\"And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they\\r\\nclosed Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I don\\'t blame him for wanting to stay\\r\\nhere ......\\r\\n214\\r\\n\"You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn\\'t you, Harry?\"\\r\\n\"He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,\" said Harry quickly.\\r\\nThe three of them fell silent. After a long pause, Hermione voiced the\\r\\nknottiest question of all in a hesitant voice.\\r\\n\"Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?\"\\r\\n\"That\\'d be a cheerful visit,\" said Ron. \"\\'Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have\\r\\nyou been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?\"\\'\\r\\nIn the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid\\r\\nunless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by\\r\\nwith no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became\\r\\nhopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had\\r\\nbeen expelled. It was now nearly four months since Justin and Nearly\\r\\nHeadless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to\\r\\nthink that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Peeves\\r\\nhad finally got bored of his \"Oh, Potter, you rotter\" song, Ernie\\r\\nMacmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping\\r\\ntoadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the\\r\\nMandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This\\r\\nmade Professor Sprout very happy.\\r\\n\"The moment they start trying to move into each other\\'s pots, we\\'ll\\r\\nknow they\\'re fully mature,\" she told Harry. \"Then we\\'ll be able to\\r\\nrevive those poor people in the hospital wing.\"\\r\\nThe second years were given something new to think about during\\r\\ntheir Easter holidays. The time had come to choose their subjects for\\r\\nthe third year, a matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously.\\r\\n\"it could affect our whole future,\" she told Harry and Ron as they\\r\\npored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks.\\r\\n\"I just want to give up Potions,\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"We can\\'t,\" said Ron gloomily. \"We keep all our old subjects, or I\\'d\\'ve\\r\\nditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.\"\\r\\n215\\r\\n\"But that\\'s very important!\" said Hermione, shocked.\\r\\n\"Not the way Lockhart teaches it,\" said Ron. \"I haven\\'t learned\\r\\nanything from him except not to set pixies loose.\"\\r\\nNeville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and\\r\\nwizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what to\\r\\nchoose. Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with\\r\\nhis tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy\\r\\nsounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes. Dean\\r\\nThomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up\\r\\nclosing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the\\r\\nsubjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody\\'s advice but signed up for\\r\\neverything.\\r\\nHarry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon\\r\\nand Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in\\r\\nwizardry with them. Not that he didn\\'t get any guidance: Percy\\r\\nWeasley was eager to share his experience.\\r\\n\"Depends where you want to go, Harry,\" he said. \"It\\'s never too early\\r\\nto think about the future, so Id recommend Divination. People say\\r\\nMuggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should\\r\\nhave a thorough understanding of the non-magical community,\\r\\nparticularly if they\\'re thinking of working in close contact with them -\\r\\nlook at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My\\r\\nbrother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for\\r\\nCare of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Harry.\"\\r\\nBut the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In\\r\\nthe end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was\\r\\nlousy at them, at least he\\'d have someone friendly to help him.\\r\\nGryffindor\\'s next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood\\r\\nwas insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry\\r\\nbarely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However,\\r\\nthe training sessions were getting better, or at least\\r\\ndrier, and the evening before Saturday\\'s match he went up to his\\r\\ndormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor\\'s chances for\\r\\nthe Quidditch cup had never been better.\\r\\n216\\r\\nBut his cheerful mood didn\\'t last long. At the top of the stairs to the\\r\\ndormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic.\\r\\n\"Harry - I don\\'t know who did it - I just found -\"\\r\\nWatching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the door.\\r\\nThe contents of Harry\\'s trunk had been thrown everywhere. His\\r\\ncloak lay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off his\\r\\nfour-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside\\r\\ncabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress.\\r\\nHarry walked over to the bed, open-mouthed, treading on a few\\r\\nloose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and Neville pulled the\\r\\nblankets back onto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in. Dean\\r\\nswore loudly.\\r\\n\"What happened, Harry?\"\\r\\n\"No idea,\" said Harry. But Ron was examining Harry\\'s robes. All the\\r\\npockets were hanging out.\\r\\n\"Someone\\'s been looking for something,\" said Ron. \"Is there anything\\r\\nmissing?\"\\r\\nHarry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk.\\r\\nIt was only as he threw the last of the Lockhart books back into it\\r\\nthat he realized what wasn\\'t there.\\r\\n\"Riddle\\'s diary\\'s gone,\" he said in an undertone to Ron.\\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\nHarry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followed\\r\\nhim out. They hurried down to the Gryffindor common\\r\\nroom, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting\\r\\nalone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy.\\r\\nHermione looked aghast at the news.\\r\\n217\\r\\n\"But - only a Gryffindor could have stolen - nobody else knows our\\r\\npassword -\"\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" said Harry.\\r\\nThey woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing\\r\\nbreeze.\\r\\n\"Perfect Quidditch conditions!\" said Wood enthusiastically at the\\r\\nGryffindor table, loading the team\\'s plates with scrambled eggs.\\r\\n\"Harry, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast.\"\\r\\nHarry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering\\r\\nif the new owner of Riddle\\'s diary was right in front of his eyes.\\r\\nHermione had been urging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn\\'t\\r\\nlike the idea. He\\'d have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and how\\r\\nmany people knew why Hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago? He\\r\\ndidn\\'t want to be the one who brought it all up again.\\r\\nAs he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his\\r\\nQuidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Harry\\'s\\r\\ngrowing list. He had just set foot on the marble staircase when he\\r\\nheard it yet again\\r\\n\"Kill this time ... let me rip ... tear. . .\"\\r\\nHe shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from him\\r\\nin alarm.\\r\\n\"The voice!\" said Harry, -looking over his shoulder. \"I just heard it\\r\\nagain - didn\\'t you?\"\\r\\nRon shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however, clapped a\\r\\nhand to her forehead.\\r\\n\"Harry - I think I\\'ve just understood something! I\\'ve got to go to the\\r\\nlibrary!\"\\r\\nAnd she sprinted away, up the stairs.\\r\\n\"What does she understand?\" said Harry distractedly, still looking\\r\\naround, trying to tell where the voice had come from.\\r\\n218\\r\\n\"Loads more than I do,\" said Ron, shaking his head.\\r\\n\"But why\\'s she got to go to the library?\"\\r\\n\"Because that\\'s what Hermione does,\" said Ron, shrugging. \"When in\\r\\ndoubt, go to the library.\"\\r\\nHarry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people\\r\\nwere now emerging from the Great Hall behind him, talking loudly,\\r\\nexiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.\\r\\n\"You\\'d better get moving,\" said Ron. \"It\\'s nearly eleven - the match -\\r\\n\"\\r\\nHarry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus Two\\r\\nThousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds,\\r\\nbut his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and\\r\\nas he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker. room, his only comfort\\r\\nwas that everyone was now outside to watch the game.\\r\\nThe teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. Oliver\\r\\nWood took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; Madam\\r\\nHooch released the balls. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary\\r\\nyellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of\\r\\ntactics.\\r\\nHarry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGonagall\\r\\ncame half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an\\r\\nenormous purple megaphone.\\r\\nHarry\\'s heart dropped like a stone.\\r\\n\"This match has been cancelled,\" Professor McGonagall called\\r\\nthrough the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium. There were\\r\\nboos and shouts. Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and ran\\r\\ntoward Professor McGonagall without getting off his broomstick.\\r\\n\"But, Professor!\" he shouted. \"We\\'ve got to play - the cup\\r\\nGryffindor -\"\\r\\n219\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her\\r\\nmegaphone:\\r\\n\"All students are to make their way back to the House common\\r\\nrooms, where their Heads of Houses will give them further\\r\\ninformation. As quickly as you can, please!\"\\r\\nThen she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her.\\r\\n\"Potter, I think you\\'d better come with me ......\\r\\nWondering how she could possibly suspect him this time, Harry saw\\r\\nRon detach himself from the complaining crowd; he came running up\\r\\nto them as they set off toward the castle. To Harry\\'s surprise,\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall didn\\'t object.\\r\\n\"Yes, perhaps you\\'d better come, too, Weasley .....\\r\\nSome of the students swarming around them were grumbling about\\r\\nthe match being canceled; others looked worried. Harry and Ron\\r\\nfollowed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up the\\r\\nmarble staircase. But they weren\\'t taken to anybody\\'s office this time.\\r\\n\"This will be a bit of a shock,\" said Professor McGonagall in a\\r\\nsurprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. \"There has\\r\\nbeen another attack ... another double attack.\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s insides did a horrible somersault. Professor McGonagall\\r\\npushed the door open and he and Ron entered. .\\r\\nMadam Pomfrey was bending over a fifth-year girl with long, curly\\r\\nhair. Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they\\'d accidentally\\r\\nasked for directions to the Slytherin common room. And on the bed\\r\\nnext to her was\\r\\n\"Hermione!\" Ron groaned.\\r\\nHermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy.\\r\\n\"They were found near the library,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I\\r\\ndon\\'t suppose either of you can explain this? It was on the floor next\\r\\nto them ......\\r\\n220\\r\\nShe was holding up a small, circular mirror.\\r\\nHarry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Hermione.\\r\\n\"I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,\" said Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall heavily. \"I need to address the students in any case.\\r\\n\"All students will return to their House common rooms by six o\\'clock\\r\\nin the evening. No student is to leave the dormitories after that time.\\r\\nYou will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to use\\r\\nthe bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All further Quidditch\\r\\ntraining and matches are to be postponed. There will be no more\\r\\nevening activities.\"\\r\\nThe Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall in silence. She rolled up the parchment\\r\\nfrom which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked\\r\\nvoice, \"I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed. It is\\r\\nlikely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these\\r\\nattacks is caught. I would urge anyone who thinks they might know\\r\\nanything about them to come forward.\"\\r\\nShe climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and the\\r\\nGryffindors began talking immediately.\\r\\n\"That\\'s two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, one\\r\\nRavenclaw, and one Hufflepuff, \" said the Weasley twins\\' friend Lee\\r\\nJordan, counting on his fingers. \"Haven\\'t any of the teachers noticed\\r\\nthat the Slytherins are all safe? Isn\\'t it obvious all this stuff\\'s coming\\r\\nfrom Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin - why\\r\\ndon\\'t they just chuck all the Slytherins out?\" he roared, to nods and\\r\\nscattered applause.\\r\\nPercy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once he didn\\'t\\r\\nseem keen to make his views heard. He was looking pale and stunned.\\r\\n\"Percy\\'s in shock,\" George told Harry quietly. \"That Ravenclaw girl -\\r\\nPenelope Clearwater - she\\'s a prefect. I don\\'t think he thought the\\r\\nmonster would dare attack a prefect.\"\\r\\n221\\r\\nBut Harry was only half-listening. He didn\\'t seem to be able to get rid\\r\\nof the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as though carved\\r\\nout of stone. And if the culprit wasn\\'t caught soon, he was looking at a\\r\\nlifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in\\r\\nbecause he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the\\r\\nschool closed. Harry now knew exactly how he had felt.\\r\\n\"What\\'re we going to do?\" said Ron quietly in Harry\\'s ear. \"D\\'you\\r\\nthink they suspect Hagrid?\"\\r\\n\"We\\'ve got to go and talk to him,\" said Harry, making up his\\r\\nmind. \"I can\\'t believe it\\'s him this time, but if he set the monster\\r\\nloose last time he\\'ll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets,\\r\\nand that\\'s a start.\"\\r\\n\"But McGonagall said we\\'ve got to stay in our tower unless we\\'re\\r\\nin class -\"\\r\\n\"I think,\" said Harry, more quietly still, \"it\\'s time to get my dad\\'s\\r\\nold cloak out again.\"\\r\\nHarry had inherited) ust one thing from his father: a long and sil\\r\\nvery Invisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out of\\r\\nthe school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it. They\\r\\nwent to bed at the usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and Sea\\r\\nmus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally\\r\\nfallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak over\\r\\nthemselves.\\r\\nThe journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors\\r\\nwasn\\'t enjoyable. Harry, who had wandered the castle at night sev\\r\\neral times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. Teach\\r\\ners, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs,\\r\\nstaring around for any unusual activity. Their Invisibility Cloak\\r\\ndidn\\'t stop them making any noise, and there was a particularly\\r\\ntense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot\\r\\nwhere Snape stood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at\\r\\nalmost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with relief that they\\r\\nreached the oak front doors and eased them open.\\r\\nIt was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windows\\r\\nof Hagrid\\'s house and pulled off the cloak only when they were\\r\\nright outside his front door.\\r\\nSeconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open. They found\\r\\nthemselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them. Fang\\r\\n222\\r\\nthe boarhound barked loudly behind him.\\r\\n\"Oh,\" he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. \"What\\'re\\r\\nyou two doin\\' here?\"\\r\\n\"What\\'s that for?\" said Harry, pointing at the crossbow as they\\r\\nstepped inside.\\r\\n\"Nothin\\' - nothin\\' - \" Hagrid muttered. \"I\\'ve bin expectin\\' doesn\\'\\r\\nmatter - Sit down - I\\'ll make tea -\"\\r\\nHe hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He nearly\\r\\nextinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then\\r\\nsmashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand.\\r\\n\"Are you okay, Hagrid?\" said Harry. \"Did you hear about\\r\\nHermione?\"\\r\\n\"Oh, I heard, all righ\\',\" said Hagrid, a slight break in his voice.\\r\\nHe kept glancing nervously at the windows. He poured them both\\r\\nlarge mugs of boiling water (he had forgotten to add tea bags) and\\r\\nwas just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud\\r\\nknock on the door.\\r\\nHagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and Ron exchanged\\r\\npanicstricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over\\r\\nthemselves and retreated into a corner. Hagrid checked that they\\r\\nwere hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door once\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\"Good evening, Hagrid.\"\\r\\nIt was Dumbledore. He entered, looking deadly serious, and was\\r\\nfollowed by a second, very odd-looking man.\\r\\nThe stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and\\r\\nwas wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, a\\r\\nscarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his arm\\r\\nhe carried a lime-green bowler.\\r\\n223\\r\\n\"That\\'s Dad\\'s boss!\" Ron breathed. \"Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of\\r\\nMagic!\"\\r\\nHarry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.\\r\\nHagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his chairs\\r\\nand looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge.\\r\\n\"Bad business, Hagrid,\" said Fudge in rather clipped tones. \"Very bad\\r\\nbusiness. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things\\'ve gone\\r\\nfar enough. Ministry\\'s got to act.\"\\r\\n\"I never,\" said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. \"You know I\\r\\nnever, Professor Dumbledore, sir -\"\\r\\n\"I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,\"\\r\\nsaid Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge.\\r\\n\"Look, Albus,\" said Fudge, uncomfortably. \"Hagrid\\'s record\\'s against\\r\\nhim. Ministry\\'s got to do something - the school governors have been\\r\\nin touch -\"\\r\\n\"Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help\\r\\nin the slightest,\" said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were full of a fire\\r\\nHarry had never seen before.\\r\\n\"Look at it from my point of view,\" said Fudge, fidgeting with his\\r\\nbowler. \"I\\'m under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doing\\r\\nsomething. If it turns out it wasn\\'t Hagrid, he\\'ll be back and no more\\r\\nsaid. But I\\'ve got to take him. Got to. Wouldn\\'t be doing my duty -\"\\r\\n\"Take me?\" said Hagrid, who was trembling. \"Take me where?\"\\r\\n\"For a short stretch only,\" said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid\\'s eyes. \"Not\\r\\na punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught,\\r\\nyou\\'ll be let out with a full apology -\"\\r\\n\"Not Azkaban?\" croaked Hagrid.\\r\\nBefore Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door.\\r\\n224\\r\\nDumbledore answered it. It was Harry\\'s turn for an elbow in the ribs;\\r\\nhe\\'d let out an audible gasp.\\r\\nMr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid\\'s hut, swathed in a long black\\r\\ntraveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. Fang started to\\r\\ngrowl.\\r\\n\"Already here, Fudge,\" he said approvingly. \"Good, good. . .\"\\r\\n\"What\\'re you doin\\' here?\" said Hagrid furiously. \"Get outta my house!\"\\r\\n\"My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being\\r\\ninside your - er - d\\'you call this a house?\" said Lucius Malfoy, sneering\\r\\nas he looked around the small cabin. \"I simply called at the school and\\r\\nwas told that the headmaster was here.\"\\r\\n\"And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?\" said Dumbledore.\\r\\nHe spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes.\\r\\n\"Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,\" said Malfoy lazily, taking out a long roll\\r\\nof parchment, \"but the governors feel it\\'s time for you to step aside.\\r\\nThis is an Order of Suspension - you\\'ll find all twelve signatures on it.\\r\\nI\\'m afraid we feel you\\'re losing your touch. How many attacks have\\r\\nthere been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn\\'t it? At this rate,\\r\\nthere\\'ll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what\\r\\nan awful loss that would be to the school.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, now, see here, Lucius,\" said Fudge, looking alarmed,\\r\\n\"Dumbledore suspended - no, no - last thing we want just now\\r\\n262\\r\\n\"The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter for\\r\\nthe governors, Fudge,\" said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. \"And as\\r\\nDumbledore has failed to stop these attacks -\"\\r\\n\"See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can\\'t stop them,\" said Fudge, whose\\r\\nupper lip was sweating now, \"I mean to say, who can?\"\\r\\n\"That remains to be seen,\" said Mr. Malfoy with a nasty smile. \"But as\\r\\nall twelve of us have voted -\"\\r\\n225\\r\\nHagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling.\\r\\n\\'An\\' how many did yeh have ter threaten an\\' blackmail before they\\r\\nagreed, Malfoy, eh?\" he roared.\\r\\n\"Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble\\r\\none of these days, Hagrid,\" said Mr. Malfoy. \"I would advise you not\\r\\nto shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won\\'t like it at all.\"\\r\\n\"Yeh can\\' take Dumbledore!\" yelled Hagrid, making Fang the\\r\\nboarhound cower and whimper in his basket. \"Take him away, an\\' the\\r\\nMuggle-borns won\\' stand a chance! There\\'ll be killin\\' next!\"\\r\\n\"Calm yourself, Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore sharply. He looked at\\r\\nLucius Malfoy.\\r\\n\"If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside\\r\\n-\"\\r\\n\"But -\" stuttered Fudge.\\r\\n\"No!\"growled Hagrid.\\r\\nDumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy\\'s\\r\\ncold gray ones.\\r\\n\"However,\" said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that\\r\\nnone of them could miss a word, \"you will find that I will\\r\\n* 26$*\\r\\nummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake\\r\\nalike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into\\r\\nbloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castle\\r\\nwindows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn\\'t\\r\\nlook right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle,\\r\\nwhere things were so horribly wrong.\\r\\nHarry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now\\r\\nbarred from the hospital wing.\\r\\n226\\r\\n\"We\\'re taking no more chances,\" Madam Pomfrey told them severely\\r\\nthrough a crack in the infirmary door. \"No, I\\'m sorry, there\\'s every\\r\\nchance the attacker might come back to finish these people off . . .\"\\r\\nWith Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the\\r\\nsun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned\\r\\nwindows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school\\r\\n* 265*\\r\\nthat didn\\'t look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through\\r\\nthe corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.\\r\\nHarry constantly repeated Dumbledore\\'s final words to himself \"I will\\r\\nonly truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me... Help will\\r\\nalways be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\" But what good\\r\\nwere these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help,\\r\\nwhen everyone was just as confused and scared as they were?\\r\\nHagrid\\'s hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the\\r\\ntrouble was, there didn\\'t seem to be a single spider left in the castle to\\r\\nfollow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly)\\r\\nby Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren\\'t\\r\\nallowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle\\r\\nin a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students\\r\\nseemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by\\r\\nteachers, but Harry found it very irksome.\\r\\nOne person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the\\r\\natmosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting\\r\\naround the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy.\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions\\r\\nlesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when,\\r\\nsitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe\\r\\nand Goyle.\\r\\n\"I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of\\r\\nDumbledore,\" he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. \"I told you\\r\\nhe thinks Dumbledore\\'s the worst headmaster the school\\'s ever\\r\\n227\\r\\n*266*\\r\\nhad. Maybe we\\'ll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won\\'t\\r\\nwant the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall won\\'t last long,\\r\\nshe\\'s only filling in ......\\r\\nSnape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione\\'s\\r\\nempty seat and cauldron.\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said Malfoy loudly. \"Sir, why don\\'t you apply for the\\r\\nheadmaster\\'s job?\"\\r\\n\"Now, now, Malfoy,\" said Snape, though he couldn\\'t suppress a thinlipped\\r\\nsmile. \"Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the\\r\\ngovernors. I daresay he\\'ll be back with us soon enough.\"\\r\\n\"Yeah, right,\" said Malfoy, smirking. \"I expect you\\'d have Father\\'s\\r\\nvote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job - I\\'ll tell Father you\\'re the\\r\\nbest teacher here, sir -\"\\r\\nSnape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not\\r\\nspotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into his\\r\\ncauldron.\\r\\n\"I\\'m quite surprised the Mudbloods haven\\'t all packed their bags by\\r\\nnow,\" Malfoy went on. \"Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pity\\r\\nit wasn\\'t Granger -\"\\r\\nThe bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy\\'s last\\r\\nwords, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags\\r\\nand books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed.\\r\\n\"Let me at him,\" Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t care, I don\\'t need my wand, I\\'m going to kill him with my bare\\r\\nhands -\"\\r\\n\"Hurry up, I\\'ve got to take you all to Herbology,\" barked Snape over\\r\\nthe class\\'s heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean\\r\\nbringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only\\r\\n* 261*\\r\\n228\\r\\nsafe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle and\\r\\nthey were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the\\r\\ngreenhouses.\\r\\nThe Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing\\r\\nfrom their number, Justin and Hermione.\\r\\nProfessor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian\\r\\nShrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the\\r\\ncompost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan.\\r\\nErnie took a deep breath and said, very formally, \"I just want to say,\\r\\nHarry, that I\\'m sorry I ever suspected you. I know you\\'d never attack\\r\\nHermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I said. We\\'re all in\\r\\nthe same boat now, and, well -\"\\r\\nHe held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it.\\r\\nErnie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as\\r\\nHarry and Ron.\\r\\n\"That Draco Malfoy character,\" said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs,\\r\\n\"he seems very pleased about all this, doesn\\'t he? D\\'you know, I think\\r\\nhe might be Slytherin\\'s heir.\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s clever of you,\" said Ron, who didn\\'t seem to have forgiven\\r\\nErnie as readily as Harry.\\r\\n\"Do you think it\\'s Malfoy, Harry?\" Ernie asked.\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared.\\r\\nA second later, Harry spotted something.\\r\\nSeveral large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side\\r\\nof the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the\\r\\nshortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit Ron over the hand\\r\\nwith his pruning shears.\\r\\n\"Ouch! What\\'re you -\"\\r\\n268\\r\\n229\\r\\nHarry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes\\r\\nscrewed up against the sun.\\r\\n\"Oh, yeah,\" said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased. \"But we can\\'t\\r\\nfollow them now -\"\\r\\nErnie and Hannah were listening curiously.\\r\\nHarry\\'s eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pursued\\r\\ntheir fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would\\r\\nend up.\\r\\n\"Looks like they\\'re heading for the Forbidden Forest . . . .\"\\r\\nAnd Ron looked even unhappier about that.\\r\\nAt the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their\\r\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged behind\\r\\nthe others so they could talk out of earshot.\\r\\n\"We\\'ll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,\" Harry told Ron. \"We\\r\\ncan take Fang with us. He\\'s used to going into the forest with Hagrid,\\r\\nhe might be some help.\"\\r\\n\"Right,\" said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers.\\r\\n\"Er - aren\\'t there - aren\\'t there supposed to be werewolves in the\\r\\nforest?\" he added as they took their usual places at the back of\\r\\nLockhart\\'s classroom.\\r\\nPreferring not to answer that question, Harry said, \"There are good\\r\\nthings in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns ...\\r\\nRon had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Harry had\\r\\nentered it only once and had hoped never to do so again.\\r\\nLockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him. Every\\r\\nother teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but\\r\\nLockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant.\\r\\n2 69\\r\\n\"Come now,\" he cried, beaming around him. \"Why all these long\\r\\n230\\r\\nfaces?\"\\r\\nPeople swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you people realize,\" said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as though\\r\\nthey were all a bit dim, \"the danger has passed! The culprit has been\\r\\ntaken away -\"\\r\\n\"Says who?\" said Dean Thomas loudly.\\r\\n\"My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn\\'t have taken\\r\\nHagrid if he hadn\\'t been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,\"\\r\\nsaid Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one\\r\\nmade two.\\r\\n\"Oh, yes he would,\" said Ron, even more loudly than Dean.\\r\\n\"I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid\\'s arrest than you\\r\\ndo, Mr. Weasley,\" said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone.\\r\\nRon started to say that he didn\\'t think so, somehow, but stopped in\\r\\nmidsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk.\\r\\n\"We weren\\'t there, remember?\" Harry muttered.\\r\\nBut Lockhart\\'s disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always\\r\\nthought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole business\\r\\nwas now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw\\r\\nGadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart\\'s stupid face. Instead he\\r\\ncontented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let\\'s do it tonight.\\r\\nRon read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the\\r\\nempty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his\\r\\nresolve, and he nodded.\\r\\nThe Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days,\\r\\nbecause from six o\\'clock onward the Gryffindors had no -\\r\\n*270*\\r\\nwhere else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result\\r\\nthat the common room often didn\\'t empty until past midnight.\\r\\n231\\r\\nHarry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after\\r\\ndinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to\\r\\nclear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of\\r\\nExploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in\\r\\nHermione\\'s usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying\\r\\nto finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight\\r\\nwhen Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed.\\r\\nHarry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors\\r\\nclosing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and\\r\\nclimbing through the portrait hole.\\r\\nIt was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the\\r\\nteachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on\\r\\nthe oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any\\r\\ncreaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.\\r\\n\"\\'Course,\" said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass,\\r\\n\"we might get to the forest and find there\\'s nothing to follow. Those\\r\\nspiders might not\\'ve been going there at all. I know it looked like they\\r\\nwere moving in that sort of general direction, but. . .\"\\r\\nHis voice trailed away hopefully.\\r\\nThey reached Hagrid\\'s house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank\\r\\nwindows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy\\r\\nat the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle\\r\\nwith his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge from\\r\\na tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together.\\r\\nHarry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid\\'s table. There would be no\\r\\nneed for it in the pitch-dark forest.\\r\\n* 21:L *\\r\\n\"C\\'mon, Fang, we\\'re going for a walk,\" said Harry, patting his leg, and\\r\\nFang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the\\r\\nedge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.\\r\\nHarry took out his wand, murmured, \"Lumos!\" and a tiny light\\r\\nappeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for\\r\\n232\\r\\nsigns of spiders.\\r\\n\"Good thinking,\" said Ron. \"Id light mine, too, but you know - it\\'d\\r\\nprobably blow up or something ......\\r\\nHarry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary\\r\\nspiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the\\r\\ntrees.\\r\\n\"Okay,\" Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, \"I\\'m ready. Let\\'s\\r\\ngo.\"\\r\\nSo, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves,\\r\\nthey entered the forest. By the glow of Harry\\'s wand, they followed\\r\\nthe steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked\\r\\nbehind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for\\r\\nnoises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the\\r\\ntrees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were\\r\\nno longer visible, and Harry\\'s wand shone alone in the sea of dark,\\r\\nthey saw their spider guides leaving the path.\\r\\nHarry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but\\r\\neverything outside his little sphere of *light was pitch-black. He had\\r\\nnever been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly\\r\\nremember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time\\r\\nhe\\'d been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in\\r\\na cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders.\\r\\n* 2-V2 *\\r\\nSomething wet touched Harry\\'s hand and he jumped backward,\\r\\ncrushing Rods foot, but it was only Fang\\'s nose.\\r\\n\"What d\\'you reckon?\" Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just\\r\\nmake out, reflecting the light from his wand.\\r\\n\"We\\'ve come this far,\" said Ron.\\r\\nSo they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees.\\r\\nThey couldn\\'t move very quickly now; there were tree roots and\\r\\nstumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry could\\r\\nfeel Fang\\'s hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop,\\r\\n233\\r\\nso that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.\\r\\nThey walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes\\r\\nsnagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they\\r\\nnoticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the\\r\\ntrees were as thick as ever.\\r\\nThen Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry\\r\\nand Ron jump out of their skins.\\r\\n\"What?\" said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and\\r\\ngripping Harry\\'s elbow very hard.\\r\\n\"There\\'s something moving over there,\" Harry breathed. \"Listen ...\\r\\nsounds like something big ......\\r\\nThey listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was\\r\\nsnapping branches as it carved a path through the trees.\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said Ron. \"Oh, no, oh, no, oh -\"\\r\\n\"Shut up,\" said Harry frantically. \"It\\'ll hear you.\"\\r\\n\"Hear me?\" said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. \"It\\'s already heard\\r\\nFang!\"\\r\\nThe darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they\\r\\n* 273*\\r\\nstood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then\\r\\nsilence.\\r\\n\"What d\\'you think it\\'s doing?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Probably getting ready to pounce,\" said Ron.\\r\\nThey waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.\\r\\n\"D\\'you think it\\'s gone?\" Harry whispered.\\r\\n\"Dunno -\"\\r\\n234\\r\\nThen, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the\\r\\ndarkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes.\\r\\nFang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and\\r\\nyelped even louder.\\r\\n\"Harry!\" Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief \"Harry, it\\'s our\\r\\ncar!\"\\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n\"Come on!\"\\r\\nHarry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping,\\r\\nand a moment later they had emerged into a clearing.\\r\\nMr. Weasley\\'s car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of\\r\\nthick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. As\\r\\nRon walked, open-mouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him,\\r\\nexactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner.\\r\\n\"It\\'s been here all the time!\" said Ron delightedly, walking around the\\r\\ncar. \"Look at it. The forest\\'s turned it wild . . . .\"\\r\\nThe sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud.\\r\\nApparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own.\\r\\nFang didn\\'t seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who could\\r\\nfeel him quivering. His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed\\r\\nhis wand back into his robes.\\r\\n*214*\\r\\n\"And we thought it was going to attack us!\" said Ron, leaning against\\r\\nthe car and patting it. \"I wondered where it had gone!\"\\r\\nHarry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders,\\r\\nbut they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights.\\r\\n\"We\\'ve lost the trail,\" he said. \"C\\'mon, let\\'s go and find them.\"\\r\\nRon didn\\'t speak. He didn\\'t move. His eyes were fixed on a point\\r\\nsome ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face was\\r\\n235\\r\\nlivid with terror.\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t even have time to turn around. There was a loud clicking\\r\\nnoise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around\\r\\nthe middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging\\r\\nfacedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron\\'s\\r\\nlegs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling - next\\r\\nmoment, he was being swept away into the dark trees.\\r\\nHead hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on\\r\\nsix immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below\\r\\na pair of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of\\r\\nthe creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very\\r\\nheart of the forest. Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from\\r\\na third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn\\'t have yelled even if\\r\\nhe had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car\\r\\nin the clearing.\\r\\nHe never knew how long he was in the creature\\'s clutches; he only\\r\\nknew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the\\r\\nleaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his neck\\r\\nsideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge of\\r\\n*21$*\\r\\na vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars\\r\\nshone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on.\\r\\nSpiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below.\\r\\nSpiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy,\\r\\ngigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way\\r\\ndown the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of\\r\\nthe hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their\\r\\npincers excitedly at the sight of its load.\\r\\nHarry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron\\r\\nand Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn\\'t howling anymore,\\r\\nbut cowering silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt.\\r\\nHis mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes\\r\\nwere popping.\\r\\nHarry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was\\r\\n236\\r\\nsaying something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his\\r\\npincers with every word he spoke.\\r\\n\"Aragog!\" it called. \"Aragog!\"\\r\\nAnd from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a\\r\\nsmall elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of\\r\\nhis body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was\\r\\nmilky white. He was blind.\\r\\n\"What is it?\" he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.\\r\\n\"Men,\" clicked the spider who had caught Harry.\\r\\n\"Is it Hagrid?\" said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes\\r\\nwandering vaguely.\\r\\n\"Strangers,\" clicked the spider who had brought Ron.\\r\\n\"Kill them,\" clicked Aragog fretfully. \"I was sleeping ......\\r\\n\"We\\'re friends of Hagrid\\'s,\" Harry shouted. His heart seemed to have\\r\\nleft his chest to pound in his throat.\\r\\n*216*\\r\\nClick, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow.\\r\\nAragog paused.\\r\\n\"Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,\" he said slowly.\\r\\n\"Hagrid\\'s in trouble,\" said Harry, breathing very fast. \"That\\'s why\\r\\nwe\\'ve come.\"\\r\\n\"In trouble?\" said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern\\r\\nbeneath the clicking pincers. \"But why has he sent you?\"\\r\\nHarry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn\\'t\\r\\nthink his legs would support him. So he spoke from the ground, as\\r\\ncalmly as he could.\\r\\n237\\r\\n\"They think,, up at the school, that Hagrid\\'s been setting a a -\\r\\nsomething on students. They\\'ve taken him to Azkaban.\"\\r\\nAragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the\\r\\nsound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause,\\r\\nexcept applause didn\\'t usually make Harry feel sick with fear.\\r\\n\"But that was years ago,\" said Aragog fretfully. \"Years and years ago.\\r\\nI remember it well. That\\'s why they made him leave the school. They\\r\\nbelieved that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the\\r\\nChamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had opened the\\r\\nChamber and set me free.\"\\r\\n\"And you ... you didn\\'t come from the Chamber of Secrets?\" said\\r\\nHarry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead.\\r\\n\"I!\" said Aragog, clicking angrily. \"I was not born in the castle. I come\\r\\nfrom a distant land. A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg.\\r\\nHagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in\\r\\nthe castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid\\r\\n2Y\\r\\nis my good friend, and a good man. When I was discovered, and\\r\\nblamed for the death of a girl, he protected me. I have lived here in\\r\\nthe forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me. He even found me\\r\\na wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through\\r\\nHagrid\\'s goodness ......\\r\\nHarry summoned what remained of his courage.\\r\\n\"So you never - never attacked anyone?\"\\r\\n\"Never,\" croaked the old spider. \"It would have been my instinct, but\\r\\nout of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body of the\\r\\ngirl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any\\r\\npart of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our kind like\\r\\nthe dark and the quiet ......\\r\\n\"But then ... Do you know what did kill that girl?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Because whatever it is, it\\'s back and attacking people again -\"\\r\\n238\\r\\nHis words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the\\r\\nrustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted\\r\\nall around him.\\r\\n\"The thing that lives in the castle,\" said Aragog, \"is an ancient creature\\r\\nwe spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded\\r\\nwith Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the\\r\\nschool.\"\\r\\n\"What is it?\" said Harry urgently.\\r\\nMore loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.\\r\\n\"We do not speak of it!\" said Aragog fiercely. \"We do not name it! I\\r\\nnever even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he\\r\\nasked me, many times.\"\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t want to press the subject, not with the spiders\\r\\n* 2-V8 *\\r\\npressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of tamng. He\\r\\nwas backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders\\r\\ncontinued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron.\\r\\n\"We\\'ll just go, then,\" Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing\\r\\nleaves rustling behind him.\\r\\n\"Go?\" said Aragog slowly. \"I think not ......\\r\\n\"But - but -\"\\r\\n\"My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I\\r\\ncannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our\\r\\nmidst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.\"\\r\\nHarry spun around. Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wall\\r\\nof spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads.\\r\\nEven as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good, there\\r\\nwere too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting,\\r\\na loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the\\r\\n239\\r\\nhollow.\\r\\nMr. Weasley\\'s car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring,\\r\\nits horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto\\r\\ntheir backs, their endless legs waving in the air. The car screeched to\\r\\na halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open.\\r\\n\"Get Fang!\" Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the\\r\\nboarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of\\r\\nthe car - the doors slammed shut - Ron didn\\'t touch the accelerator\\r\\nbut the car didn\\'t need him; the engine roared and they were off,\\r\\nhitting more spiders. They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and\\r\\nthey were soon crashing through the forest, branches\\r\\nwhipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the\\r\\nwidest gaps, following a path it obviously knew.\\r\\nHarry looked sideways at Ron. His mouth was still open in the silent\\r\\nscream, but his eyes weren\\'t popping anymore.\\r\\n\"Are you okay?\"\\r\\nRon stared straight ahead, unable to speak.\\r\\nThey smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly\\r\\nin the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they\\r\\nsqueezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees\\r\\nthinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky.\\r\\nThe car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the\\r\\nwindshield. They had reached the edge of the forest. Fang flung\\r\\nhimself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry\\r\\nopened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid\\'s house, tail\\r\\nbetween his legs. Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron\\r\\nseemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-necked\\r\\nand staring. Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into\\r\\nthe forest and disappeared from view.\\r\\nHarry went back into Hagrid\\'s cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak. Fang\\r\\nwas trembling under a blanket in his basket. When Harry got outside\\r\\nagain, he found Ron being violently sick in the pumpkin patch.\\r\\n240\\r\\n\"Follow the spiders,\" said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve.\\r\\n\"I\\'ll never forgive Hagrid. We\\'re lucky to be alive.\"\\r\\n\"I bet he thought Aragog wouldn\\'t hurt friends of his,\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"That\\'s exactly Hagrid\\'s problem!\" said Ron, thumping the wall of the\\r\\ncabin. \"He always thinks monsters aren\\'t as bad as they\\'re\\r\\n*280*\\r\\nmade out, and look where it\\'s got him! A cell in Azkaban!\" He was\\r\\nshivering uncontrollably now. \"What was the point of sending us in\\r\\nthere? What have we found out, Id like to know?\"\\r\\n\"That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Harry,\\r\\nthrowing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him\\r\\nwalk. \"He was innocent.\"\\r\\nRon gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard\\r\\nwasn\\'t his idea of being innocent.\\r\\nAs the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure\\r\\ntheir feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar.\\r\\nThey walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the\\r\\nmarble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors where\\r\\nwatchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the safety of the\\r\\nGryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into\\r\\nglowing ash. They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to\\r\\ntheir dormitory.\\r\\nRon fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry,\\r\\nhowever, didn\\'t feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his fourposter,\\r\\nthinking hard about everything Aragog had said.\\r\\nThe creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought,\\r\\nsounded like a sort of monster Voldemort - even other monsters didn\\'t\\r\\nwant to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it\\r\\nwas, or how it Petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never known\\r\\nwhat was in the Chamber of Secrets.\\r\\nHarry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his\\r\\npillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window.\\r\\n241\\r\\nHe couldn\\'t see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends\\r\\n*281*\\r\\neverywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of\\r\\nSlytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same\\r\\nperson, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time.\\r\\nThere was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still thinking about\\r\\nwhat Aragog had said.\\r\\nHe was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last\\r\\nhope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright.\\r\\n\"Ron,\" he hissed through the dark, \"Ron -\"\\r\\nRon woke with a yelp like Fang\\'s, stared wildly around, and saw\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\n\"Ron -that girl who died. Aragog said she was found in a bathroom,\"\\r\\nsaid Harry, ignoring Neville\\'s snufing snores from the corner. \"What\\r\\nif she never left the bathroom? What if she\\'s still there?\"\\r\\nRon rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then he\\r\\nunderstood, too.\\r\\n\"You don\\'t think - not Moaning Myrtle?\"\\r\\nA ll those times we were in that bathroom, and she was just\\r\\nthree toilets away,\" said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day,\\r\\n\"and we could\\'ve asked her, and now. . .\"\\r\\nIt had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. Escaping their\\r\\nteachers long enough to sneak into a girls\\' bathroom, the girls\\' bathroom,\\r\\nmoreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be\\r\\nalmost impossible.\\r\\nBut something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drove\\r\\nthe Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks.\\r\\nTen minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told them that their\\r\\nexams would start on the first of June, one week from today.\\r\\n242\\r\\n`Exams?\" howled Seamus Finnigan. \"We\\'re still getting exams?\"\\r\\nThere was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom\\'s wand\\r\\nslipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk. Professorr\\r\\n*28%*\\r\\nMcGonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned,\\r\\nfrowning, to Seamus.\\r\\n\"The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to\\r\\nreceive your education,\" she said sternly. \"The exams will therefore\\r\\ntake place as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard.\"\\r\\nStudying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that there would be\\r\\nexams with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of mutinous\\r\\nmuttering around the room, which made Professor McGonagall scowl\\r\\neven more darkly.\\r\\n\"Professor Dumbledore\\'s instructions were to keep the school running\\r\\nas normally as possible, she said. \"And that, I need hardly point out,\\r\\nmeans finding out how much you have learned this year.\\r\\nHarry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be\\r\\nturning into slippers. What had he learned so far this year? He couldn\\'t\\r\\nseem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam.\\r\\nRon looked as though he\\'d just been told he had to go and live in the\\r\\nForbidden Forest.\\r\\n\"Can you imagine me taking exams with this?\" he asked Harry, holding\\r\\nup his wand, which had just started whistling loudly.\\r\\nThree days before their first exam, Professor McGonagall made\\r\\nanother announcement at breakfast.\\r\\n\"I have good news,\" she said, and the Great Hall, instead of falling\\r\\nsilent, erupted.\\r\\n243\\r\\n\"Dumbledore\\'s coming back!\" several people yelled joyfully.\\r\\n\"You\\'ve caught the Heir of Slytherin!\" squealed a girl at the\\r\\nRavenclaw table.\\r\\n284*\\r\\n\"Quidditch matches are back on!\" roared Wood excitedly.\\r\\nWhen the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said,\\r\\n\"Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for\\r\\ncutting at last. Tonight, we will be able to revive those people who\\r\\nhave been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that one of them may\\r\\nwell be able to tell us who, or what, attacked them. I am hopeful that\\r\\nthis dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit.\"\\r\\nThere was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over at the\\r\\nSlytherin table and wasn\\'t at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy\\r\\nhadn\\'t joined in. Ron, however, was looking happier than he\\'d looked in\\r\\ndays.\\r\\n\"It won\\'t matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!\" he said to Harry.\\r\\n\"Hermione\\'ll probably have all the answers when they wake her up!\\r\\nMind you, she\\'ll go crazy when she finds out we\\'ve got exams in three\\r\\ndays\\' time. She hasn\\'t studied. It might be kinder to leave her where\\r\\nshe is till they\\'re over.\"\\r\\nJust then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron. She\\r\\nlooked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands were\\r\\ntwisting in her lap.\\r\\n\"What\\'s up?\" said Ron, helping himself to more porridge.\\r\\nGinny didn\\'t say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor\\r\\ntable with a scared look on her face that reminded Harry of someone,\\r\\nthough he couldn\\'t think who.\\r\\n\"Spit it out,\" said Ron, watching her.\\r\\nHarry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She was rocking\\r\\nbackward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Dobby did\\r\\nwhen he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information.\\r\\n244\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got to tell you something,\" Ginny mumbled, carefully not looking at\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\n\"What is it?\" said Harry.\\r\\nGinny looked as though she couldn\\'t find the right words.\\r\\n\"What?\"said Ron.\\r\\nGinny opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Harry leaned\\r\\nforward and spoke quietly, so that only Ginny and Ron could hear him.\\r\\n\"Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have you seen\\r\\nsomething? Someone acting oddly?\"\\r\\nGinny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Percy Weasley\\r\\nappeared, looking tired and wan.\\r\\n\"If you\\'ve finished eating, I\\'ll take that seat, Ginny. I\\'m starving, I\\'ve\\r\\nonly just come off patrol duty.\"\\r\\nGinny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified, gave\\r\\nPercy a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away. Percy sat\\r\\ndown and grabbed a mug from the center of the table.\\r\\n\"Percy!\" said Ron angrily. \"She was just about to tell us some-\\' thing\\r\\nimportant!\"\\r\\nHalfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked.\\r\\n\"What sort of thing?\" he said, coughing.\\r\\n\"I just asked her if she\\'d seen anything odd, and she started to say\\r\\n\"Oh - that - that\\'s nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets,\" said\\r\\nPercy at once.\\r\\n\"How do you know?\" said Ron, his eyebrows raised.\\r\\n\"Well, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked in on me the other day\\r\\nwhen I was - well, never mind - the point is, she spot\\r\\n245\\r\\nted me doing something and I, um, I asked her not to mention it to\\r\\nanybody. I must say, I did think she\\'d keep her word. It\\'s nothing,\\r\\nreally, Id just rather -\"\\r\\nHarry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable.\\r\\n\"What were you doing, Percy?\" said Ron, grinning. \"Go on, tell us, we\\r\\nwon\\'t laugh.\"\\r\\nPercy didn\\'t smile back.\\r\\n\"Pass me those rolls, Harry, I\\'m starving.\"\\r\\nHarry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without\\r\\ntheir help, but he wasn\\'t about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle\\r\\nif it turned up - and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were\\r\\nbeing led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart.\\r\\nLockhart, who had so often assured them that all danger had passed,\\r\\nonly to be proved wrong right away, was now wholeheartedly\\r\\nconvinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safely\\r\\ndown the corridors. His hair wasn\\'t as sleek as usual; it seemed he\\r\\nhad been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth floor.\\r\\n\"Mark my words,\" he said, ushering them around a corner. \"The first\\r\\nwords out of those poor Petrified people\\'s mouths will be It was\\r\\nHagrid.\\' Frankly, I\\'m astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all\\r\\nthese security measures are necessary.\"\\r\\n(ti agree, sir,\" said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise.\\r\\n\"Thank you, Harry, said Lockhart graciously while they waited for a\\r\\nlong line of Hufflepuffs to pass. \"I mean, we teachers have quite\\r\\nenough to be getting on with, without walking students to classes and\\r\\nstanding guard all night ......\\r\\n\"That\\'s right,\" said Ron, catching on. \"Why don\\'t you leave us here, sir,\\r\\nwe\\'ve only got one more corridor to go -\"\\r\\n\"You know, Weasley, I think I will,\" said Lockhart. \"I really should go\\r\\nand prepare my next class -\"\\r\\n246\\r\\nAnd he hurried off.\\r\\n\"Prepare his class,\" Ron sneered after him. \"Gone to curl his hair,\\r\\nmore like.\"\\r\\nThey let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them, then darted\\r\\ndown a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle\\'s\\r\\nbathroom. But just as they were congratulating each other on their\\r\\nbrilliant scheme\\r\\n\"Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?\"\\r\\nIt was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the thinnest of thin\\r\\nlines.\\r\\n\"We were -we were-\" Ron stammered. \"We were going to - to go and\\r\\nsee -\"\\r\\n\"Hermione,\" said Harry. Ron and Professor McGonagall both looked\\r\\nat him.\\r\\n\"We haven\\'t seen her for ages, Professor,\" Harry went on hurriedly,\\r\\ntreading on Ron\\'s foot, \"and we thought we\\'d sneak into the hospital\\r\\nwing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er,\\r\\nnot to worry -\"\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for a moment,\\r\\nHarry thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was in\\r\\na strangely croaky voice.\\r\\n\"Of course,\" she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her\\r\\nbeady eye. \"Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends\\r\\nof those who have been ... I quite understand. Yes,\\r\\nPotter, of course you may visit Miss Granger. I will inform Professor\\r\\nBinns where you\\'ve gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my\\r\\npermission.\"\\r\\nHarry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they\\'d\\r\\navoided detention. As they turned the corner, they distinctly heard\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall blow her nose.\\r\\n247\\r\\n\"That,\" said Ron fervently, \"was the best story you\\'ve ever come up\\r\\nwith.\"\\r\\nThey had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam\\r\\nPomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall\\'s permission to visit\\r\\nHermione.\\r\\nMadam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly.\\r\\n\"There\\'s just no point talking to a Petrified. person,\" she said, and they\\r\\nhad to admit she had a point when they\\'d taken their seats next to\\r\\nHermione. It was plain that Hermione didn\\'t have the faintest inkling\\r\\nthat she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedside\\r\\ncabinet not to worry for all the good it would do.\\r\\n\"Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?\" said Ron, looking sadly\\r\\nat Hermione\\'s rigid face. \"Because if he sneaked up on them all, no\\r\\none\\'ll ever know . .....\\r\\nBut Harry wasn\\'t looking at Hermione\\'s face. He was more interested\\r\\nin her right hand. It lay clenched on top of her blankets, and bending\\r\\ncloser, he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fist.\\r\\nMaking sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, he pointed this\\r\\nout to Ron.\\r\\n\"TG and get it out,\" Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he\\r\\nblocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey\\'s view.\\r\\nIt was no easy task. Hermione\\'s hand was clamped so tightly around\\r\\nthe paper that Harry was sure he was going to tear it. While Ron kept\\r\\nwatch he tugged and twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes,\\r\\nthe paper came free.\\r\\nIt was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry smoothed it out\\r\\neagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too.\\r\\nOf the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land,\\r\\nthere is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk,\\r\\nknown also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may\\r\\nreach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born\\r\\n248\\r\\nfrom a chicken\\'s egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are\\r\\nmost wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk\\r\\nhas a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall\\r\\nsuffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal\\r\\nenemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is\\r\\nfatal to it.\\r\\nAnd beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Harry\\r\\nrecognized as Hermione\\'s. Pipes.\\r\\nIt was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain.\\r\\n\"Ron,\" he breathed. \"This is it. This is the answer. The monster in the\\r\\nChamber\\'s a basilisk - a giant serpent! That why I\\'ve been hearing\\r\\nthat voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it. It\\'s because\\r\\nI understand Parseltongue . . . .\"\\r\\nHarry looked up at the beds around him.\\r\\n\"The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no one\\'s died -\\r\\nbecause no one looked it straight in the eye. Colin saw it through his\\r\\ncamera. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got\\r\\nPetrified. Justin . . . Justin must\\'ve seen the basilisk through Nearly\\r\\nHeadless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he couldn\\'t die again .\\r\\n. . and Hermione and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a\\r\\nmirror next to them. Hermione had just realized the monster was a\\r\\nbasilisk. I bet you anything she warned the first person she met to\\r\\nlook around corners with a mirror first! And that girl pulled out her\\r\\nmirror - and -\"\\r\\nRods jaw had dropped.\\r\\n\"And Mrs. Norris?\" he whispered eagerly.\\r\\nHarry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Halloween.\\r\\n\"The water. . .\" he said slowly. \"The flood from Moaning Myrtle\\'s\\r\\nbathroom. I bet you Mrs. Norris only saw the reflection . . . .\"\\r\\nHe scanned the page in his hand eagerly. The more he looked at it,\\r\\nthe more it made sense.\\r\\n249\\r\\n`: . . The crowing of the rooster . . . is fatal to it\"! he read aloud. \"Hagrid\\'s\\r\\nroosters were killed! The Heir of Slytherin didn\\'t want one anywhere\\r\\nnear the castle once the Chamber was opened! Spidersflee before it.! It\\r\\nall fits!\"\\r\\n\"But how\\'s the basilisk been getting around the place?\" said Ron. \"A\\r\\ngiant snake . . . Someone would\\'ve seen. . .\"\\r\\nHarry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at the\\r\\nfoot of the page.\\r\\n\"Pipes,\" he said. \"Pipes . . . Ron, it\\'s been using the plumbing. I\\'ve\\r\\nbeen hearing that voice inside the walls . . . .\"\\r\\n291*\\r\\nRon suddenly grabbed Harry\\'s arm.\\r\\n\"The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!\" he said hoarsely.\\r\\n\"What if it\\'s a bathroom? What if it\\'s in -\"\\r\\n`= Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom, \"said Harry.\\r\\nThey sat there, excitement coursing through them, hardly able\\r\\nto believe it.\\r\\n\"This means,\" said Harry, \"I can\\'t be the only Parselmouth in\\r\\nthe school. The Heir of Slytherin\\'s one, too. That\\'s how he\\'s been\\r\\ncontrolling the basilisk.\"\\r\\n\"What\\'re we going to do?\" said Ron, whose eyes were flashing.\\r\\n\"Should we go straight to McGonagall?\"\\r\\n\"Let\\'s go to the staff room,\" said Harry, jumping up. \"She\\'ll be\\r\\nthere in ten minutes. It\\'s nearly break.\"\\r\\nThey ran downstairs. Not wanting to be discovered hanging\\r\\naround in another corridor, they went straight into the deserted\\r\\nstaff room. It was a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs.\\r\\nHarry and Ron paced around it, too excited to sit down.\\r\\nBut the bell to signal break never came.\\r\\nInstead, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGon\\r\\nagall\\'s voice, magically magnified.\\r\\n`All students to return to their House dormitories at once. All teach\\r\\ners return to the staff room. Immediately, please. \"\\r\\nHarry wheeled around to stare at Ron.\\r\\n\"Not another attack? Not now?\"\\r\\n250\\r\\n\"What\\'ll we do?\" said Ron, aghast. \"Go back to the dormitory?\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry, glancing around. There was an ugly sort of\\r\\nwardrobe to his left, full of the teachers\\' cloaks. \"In here. Let\\'s hear\\r\\nwhat it\\'s all about. Then we can tell them what we\\'ve found out.\"\\r\\nThey hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds of\\r\\npeople moving overhead, and the staff room door banging open.\\r\\nFrom between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the\\r\\nteachers filtering into the room. Some of them were looking puzzled,\\r\\nothers downright scared. Then Professor McGonagall arrived.\\r\\n\"It has happened,\" she told the silent staff room. \"A student has been\\r\\ntaken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself.\"\\r\\nProfessor Flitwick let out a squeal. Professor Sprout clapped her\\r\\nhands over her mouth. Snape gripped the back of a chair very hard\\r\\nand said, \"How can you be sure?\"\\r\\n\"The Heir of Slytherin,\" said Professor McGonagall, who was very\\r\\nwhite, \"left another message. Right underneath the first one. `Her\\r\\nskeleton will lie in the Chamber forever. \"\\'\\r\\nProfessor Flitwick burst into tears.\\r\\n\"Who is it?\" said Madam Hooch, who had sunk, weak-kneed, into a\\r\\nchair. \"Which student?\"\\r\\n\"Ginny Weasley,\" said Professor McGonagall.\\r\\nHarry felt Ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor beside\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\"We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow,\" said\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall. \"This is the end of Hogwarts. Dumbledore\\r\\nalways said. . .\"\\r\\nThe staffroom door banged open again. For one wild moment,\\r\\nHarry was sure it would be Dumbledore. But it was Lockhart, and\\r\\nhe was beaming.\\r\\n\"So sorry - dozed off - what have I missed?\"\\r\\n251\\r\\nHe didn\\'t seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at him\\r\\nwith something remarkably like hatred. Snape stepped forward.\\r\\n\"Just the man,\" he said. \"The very man. A girl has been snatched by\\r\\nthe monster, Lockhart. Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself. Your\\r\\nmoment has come at last.\"\\r\\nLockhart blanched.\\r\\n\"That\\'s right, Gilderoy,\" chipped in Professor Sprout. \"Weren\\'t you\\r\\nsaying just last night that you\\'ve known all along where the entrance to\\r\\nthe Chamber of Secrets is?\"\\r\\n\"I - well, I -\"sputtered Lockhart.\\r\\n\"Yes, didn\\'t you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?\"\\r\\npiped up Professor Flitwick.\\r\\n\"D-did I? I don\\'t recall -\"\\r\\n\"I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn\\'t had a\\r\\ncrack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested,\" said Snape. \"Didn\\'t\\r\\nyou say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should\\r\\nhave been given a free rein from the first?\"\\r\\nLockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues.\\r\\n\"I - I really never - you may have misunderstood -\"\\r\\n\"We\\'ll leave it to you, then, Gilderoy,\" said Professor McGonagall.\\r\\n\"Tonight will be an excellent time to do it. We\\'ll make sure everyone\\'s\\r\\nout of your way. You\\'ll be able to tackle the monster all by youself. A\\r\\nfree rein at last.\"\\r\\nLockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody came to the\\r\\nrescue. He didn\\'t look remotely handsome anymore. His lip was\\r\\ntrembling, and in the absence of his usually toothy grin, he looked\\r\\nweak-chinned and feeble.\\r\\n\"V very well,\" he said. \"I\\'ll - I\\'ll be in my office, getting getting ready.\"\\r\\nAnd he left the room.\\r\\n252\\r\\n\"Right,\" said Professor McGonagall, whose nostrils were flared,\\r\\n\"that\\'s got him out from under our feet. The Heads of Houses should\\r\\ngo and inform their students what has happened. Tell them the\\r\\nHogwarts Express will take them home first thing tomorrow. Will the\\r\\nrest of you please make sure no students have been left outside their\\r\\ndormitories.\"\\r\\nThe teachers rose and left, one by one.\\r\\nIt was probably the worst day of Harry\\'s entire life. He, Ron, Fred,\\r\\nand George sat together in a corner of the Gryffindor common room,\\r\\nunable to say anything to each other. Percy wasn\\'t there. He had gone\\r\\nto send an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut himself up in his\\r\\ndormitory.\\r\\nNo afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had Gryffindor\\r\\nTower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. Near sunset, Fred and\\r\\nGeorge went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer.\\r\\n\"She knew something, Harry,\" said Ron, speaking for the first time\\r\\nsince they had entered the wardrobe in the staff room. \"That\\'s why\\r\\nshe was taken. It wasn\\'t some stupid thing about Percy at all., She\\'d\\r\\nfound out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That must be why\\r\\nshe was -\" Ron rubbed his eyes frantically. \"I mean, she was a pureblood.\\r\\nThere can\\'t be any other reason.\"\\r\\nHarry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline. This was\\r\\nthe worst he had ever felt. If only there was something they could do.\\r\\nAnything.\\r\\n\"Harry\" said Ron. \"D\\'you think there\\'s any chance at all she\\'s not - you\\r\\nknow =\"\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t know what to say. He couldn\\'t see how Ginny could still\\r\\nbe alive.\\r\\n\"D\\'you know what?\" said Ron. \"I think we should go and see\\r\\n*295*\\r\\n253\\r\\nLockhart. Tell him what we know. He\\'s going to try and get into the\\r\\nChamber. We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it\\'s a\\r\\nbasilisk in there.\"\\r\\nBecause Harry couldn\\'t think of anything else to do, and because he\\r\\nwanted to be doing something, he agreed. The Gryffindors around\\r\\nthem were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that\\r\\nnobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and left\\r\\nthrough the portrait hole.\\r\\nDarkness was falling as they walked down to Lockhart\\'s office.\\r\\nThere seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it. They could hear\\r\\nscraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps.\\r\\nHarry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. Then the\\r\\ndoor opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of Lockhart\\'s eyes\\r\\npeering through it.\\r\\n\"Oh - Mr. Potter - Mr. Weasley -\" he said, opening the door a bit\\r\\nwider. \"I\\'m rather busy at the moment - if you would be quick -\"\\r\\n\"Professor, we\\'ve got some information for you,\" said Harry. \"We\\r\\nthink it\\'ll help you.\"\\r\\n\"Er - well - it\\'s not terribly -\" The side of Lockhart\\'s face that they\\r\\ncould see looked very uncomfortable. \"I mean - well all right -\"\\r\\nHe opened the door and they entered.\\r\\nHis office had been almost completely stripped. Two large trunks\\r\\nstood open on the floor. Robes, jade-green, lilac, midnightblue, had\\r\\nbeen hastily folded into one of them; books were jumbled untidily into\\r\\nthe other. The photographs that had covered the walls were now\\r\\ncrammed into boxes on the desk.\\r\\n*296*\\r\\n\"Are you going somewhere?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Er, well, yes,\" said Lockhart, ripping a life-size poster of himself from\\r\\nthe back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up. \"Urgent call -\\r\\nunavoidable - got to go -\"\\r\\n254\\r\\n\"What about my sister?\" said Ron jerkily.\\r\\n\"Well, as to that - most unfortunate -\" said Lockhart, avoiding their\\r\\neyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying the contents\\r\\ninto a bag. \"No one regrets more than I -\"\\r\\n\"You\\'re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"You can\\'t go now! Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!\"\\r\\n\"Well - I must say - when I took the job -\" Lockhart muttered, now\\r\\npiling socks on top of his robes. \"nothing in the job description - didn\\'t\\r\\nexpect -\"\\r\\n\"You mean you\\'re running away?\" said Harry disbelievingly. \"After all\\r\\nthat stuff you did in your books -\"\\r\\n\"Books can be misleading,\" said Lockhart delicately.\\r\\n\"You wrote them!\" Harry shouted.\\r\\n\"My dear boy,\" said Lockhart, straightening up and frowning at Harry.\\r\\n\"Do use your common sense. My books wouldn\\'t have sold half as\\r\\nwell if people didn\\'t think Id done all those things. No one wants to\\r\\nread about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a\\r\\nvillage from werewolves. He\\'d look dreadful on the front cover. No\\r\\ndress sense at all. And the witch who banished the Bandon Banshee\\r\\nhad a harelip. I mean, come on -\"\\r\\n\"So you\\'ve just been taking credit for what a load of other people have\\r\\ndone?\" said Harry incredulously.\\r\\n\"Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, shaking his head impatiently, \"it\\'s not\\r\\nnearly as simple as that. There was work involved. I had\\r\\n*297*\\r\\nto track these people down. Ask them exactly how they managed to\\r\\ndo what they did. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so they\\r\\nwouldn\\'t remember doing it. If there\\'s one thing I pride myself on, it\\'s\\r\\nmy Memory Charms. No, it\\'s been a lot of work, Harry. It\\'s not all\\r\\nbook signings and publicity photos, you know. You want fame, you\\r\\n255\\r\\nhave to be prepared for a long hard slog.\"\\r\\nHe banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them.\\r\\n\"Let\\'s see,\" he said. \"I think that\\'s everything. Yes. Only one thing\\r\\nleft.\"\\r\\nHe pulled out his wand and turned to them.\\r\\n\"Awfully sorry, boys, but I\\'ll have to put a Memory Charm on you\\r\\nnow. Can\\'t have you blabbing my secrets all over the place. Id never\\r\\nsell another book -\"\\r\\nHarry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised his,\\r\\nwhen Harry bellowed, \"Expelliarmus!\"\\r\\nLockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand flew\\r\\nhigh into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.\\r\\n\"Shouldn\\'t have let Professor Snape teach us that one,\" said Harry\\r\\nfuriously, kicking Lockhart\\'s trunk aside. Lockhart was looking up at\\r\\nhim, feeble once more. Harry was still pointing his wand at him.\\r\\n\"What d\\'you want me to do?\" said Lockhart weakly. \"I don\\'t know\\r\\nwhere the Chamber of Secrets is. There\\'s nothing I can do.\"\\r\\n\"You\\'re in luck,\" said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint.\\r\\n\"We think we know where it is. And what\\'s inside it. Let\\'s go.\"\\r\\n*298*\\r\\nThey marched Lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairs,\\r\\nalong the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall, to the\\r\\ndoor of Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom.\\r\\nThey sent Lockhart in first. Harry was pleased to see that he was\\r\\nshaking.\\r\\nMoaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet.\\r\\n\"Oh, it\\'s you,\" she said when she saw Harry. \"What do you want this\\r\\ntime?\"\\r\\n256\\r\\n\"To ask you how you died,\" said Harry.\\r\\nMyrtle\\'s whole aspect changed at once. She looked as though she had\\r\\nnever been asked such a flattering question.\\r\\n\"Ooooh, it was dreadful,\" she said with relish. \"It happened right in\\r\\nhere. I died in this very stall. I remember it so well. Id hidden because\\r\\nOlive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. The door was locked,\\r\\nand I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. They said\\r\\nsomething funny. A different language, I think it must have been.\\r\\nAnyway, what really got me was that it was a boy speaking. So I\\r\\nunlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own toilet, and then -\"\\r\\nMyrtle swelled importantly, her face shining. \"I died.\"\\r\\n\"How?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"No idea,\" said Myrtle in hushed tones. \"I just remember seeing a pair\\r\\nof great, big, yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up, and then I\\r\\nwas floating away . . . .\" She looked dreamily at Harry. \"And then I\\r\\ncame back again. I was determined to haunt Olive Hornby, you see.\\r\\nOh, she was sorry she\\'d ever laughed at my glasses.\"\\r\\n\"Where exactly did you see the eyes?\" said Harry.\\r\\n*299*\\r\\n\"Somewhere there,\" said Myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the sink in\\r\\nfront of her toilet.\\r\\nHarry and Ron hurried over to it. Lockhart was standing well back, a\\r\\nlook of utter terror on his face.\\r\\nIt looked like an ordinary sink. They examined every inch of it, inside\\r\\nand out, including the pipes below. And then Harry saw it: Scratched\\r\\non the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake.\\r\\n\"That tap\\'s never worked,\" said Myrtle brightly as he tried to turn it.\\r\\n\"Harry,\" said Ron. \"Say something. Something in Parseltongue.\"\\r\\n\"But -\" Harry thought hard. The only times he\\'d ever managed to\\r\\n257\\r\\nspeak Parseltongue were when he\\'d been faced with a real snake. He\\r\\nstared hard at the tiny- engraving, trying to imagine it was real.\\r\\n\"Open up,\" he said.\\r\\nHe looked at Ron, who shook his head.\\r\\n\"English,\" he said.\\r\\nHarry looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was alive.\\r\\nIf he moved his head, the candlelight made it look as though it were\\r\\nmoving.\\r\\n\"Open up,\" he said.\\r\\nExcept that the words weren\\'t what he heard; a strange hissing had\\r\\nescaped him, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and\\r\\nbegan to spin. Next second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact,\\r\\nsank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wide\\r\\nenough for a man to slide into.\\r\\nHarry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had made up his mind\\r\\nwhat he was going to do.\\r\\n*300*\\r\\n\"I\\'m going down there,\" he said. .\\r\\nHe couldn\\'t not go, not now they had found the entrance to the\\r\\nChamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance\\r\\nthat Ginny might be alive.\\r\\n\"Me too,\" said Ron.\\r\\nThere was a pause.\\r\\n\"Well, you hardly seem to need me,\" said Lockhart, with a shadow\\r\\nof his old smile. \"I\\'ll just -\"\\r\\nHe put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed\\r\\ntheir wands at him.\\r\\n258\\r\\n\"You can go first,\" Ron snarled.\\r\\nWhite-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening.\\r\\n\"Boys,\" he said, his voice feeble. \"Boys, what good will it do?\"\\r\\nHarry jabbed him in the back with his wand. Lockhart slid his legs\\r\\ninto the pipe.\\r\\n\"I really don\\'t think -\" he started to say, but Ron gave him a push,\\r\\nand he slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lowered himself\\r\\nslowly into the pipe, then let go.\\r\\nIt was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could see\\r\\nmore pipes branching off in all directions, but none as large as theirs,\\r\\nwhich twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knew\\r\\nthat he was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeons.\\r\\nBehind him he could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the curves.\\r\\nAnd then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen\\r\\nwhen he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the\\r\\nend with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel\\r\\nlarge enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his\\r\\n*301\\r\\nfeet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harry\\r\\nstood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too.\\r\\n\"We must be miles under the school,\" said Harry, his voice echoing in\\r\\nthe black tunnel.\\r\\n\"Under the lake, probably,\" said Ron, squinting around at the dark,\\r\\nslimy walls.\\r\\nAll three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead.\\r\\n\"Lumos!\" Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. \"C\\'mon,\" he\\r\\nsaid to Ron and Lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slapping\\r\\nloudly on the wet floor.\\r\\nThe tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead.\\r\\n259\\r\\nTheir shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight.\\r\\n\"Remember,\" Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward,\\r\\n\"any sign of movement, close your eyes right away . .....\\r\\nBut the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound\\r\\nthey heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be\\r\\na rat\\'s skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that\\r\\nit was littered with small animal bones. Trying very hard not to\\r\\nimagine what Ginny might look like if they found her, Harry led the\\r\\nway forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel.\\r\\n\"Harry - there\\'s something up there -\" said Ron hoarsely, grabbing\\r\\nHarry\\'s shoulder.\\r\\nThey froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of something\\r\\nhuge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn\\'t moving.\\r\\n\"Maybe it\\'s asleep,\" he breathed, glancing back at the other two.\\r\\nLockhart\\'s hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back to\\r\\nlook at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt.\\r\\n* 302 *\\r\\nVery slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see,\\r\\nHarry edged forward, his wand held high.\\r\\nThe light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green,\\r\\nlying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. The creature that had\\r\\nshed it must have been twenty feet long at least.\\r\\n\"Blimey,\" said Ron weakly.\\r\\nThere was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s\\r\\nknees had given way.\\r\\n\"Get up,\" said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart.\\r\\nLockhart got to his feet - then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the\\r\\nground.\\r\\nHarry jumped forward, but too late - Lockhart was straightening up,\\r\\n260\\r\\npanting, Ron\\'s wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\"The adventure ends here, boys!\" he said. \"I shall take a bit of this\\r\\nskin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl,\\r\\nand that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her\\r\\nmangled body - say good-bye to your memories!\"\\r\\nHe raised Ron\\'s Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled,\\r\\n\"Obliviate!\"\\r\\nThe wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung his\\r\\narms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out\\r\\nof the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to\\r\\nthe floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall\\r\\nof broken rock.\\r\\n\"Ron!\" he shouted. \"Are you okay? Ron!\"\\r\\n\"I\\'m here!\" came Ron\\'s muffled voice from behind the rockfall. \"I\\'m\\r\\nokay - this git\\'s not, though - he got blasted by the wand =\\'\\r\\n*303*\\r\\nThere was a dull thud and a loud \"ow!\" It sounded as though Ron had\\r\\njust kicked Lockhart in the shins.\\r\\n\"What now?\" Ron\\'s voice said, sounding desperate. \"We can\\'t get\\r\\nthrough - it\\'ll take ages ......\\r\\nHarry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it.\\r\\nHe had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by\\r\\nmagic, and now didn\\'t seem a good moment to try - what if the whole\\r\\ntunnel caved in?\\r\\nThere was another thud and another \"ow!\" from behind the rocks.\\r\\nThey were wasting time. Ginny had already been in the Chamber of\\r\\nSecrets for hours .... Harry knew there was only one thing to do.\\r\\n\"Wait there,\" he called to Ron. \"Wait with Lockhart. I\\'ll go on.... If I\\'m\\r\\nnot back in an hour. . .\\r\\n261\\r\\nThere was a very pregnant pause,\\r\\n\"I\\'ll try and shift some of this rock,\" said Ron, who seemed to be trying\\r\\nto keep his voice steady. \"So you can - can get back through. And,\\r\\nHarry -\"\\r\\n\"See you in a bit,\" said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his\\r\\nshaking voice.\\r\\nAnd he set off alone past the giant snake skin.\\r\\nSoon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone.\\r\\nThe tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry\\'s body was\\r\\ntingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded what\\r\\nhe\\'d find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept around yet another\\r\\nbend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were\\r\\ncarved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.\\r\\n*304*\\r\\nHarry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to pretend\\r\\nthese stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely alive.\\r\\nHe could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and the\\r\\nemerald eyes seemed to flicker.\\r\\n\"Open, \"said Harry, in a low, faint hiss.\\r\\nThe serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly\\r\\nout of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside.\\r\\ne was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber. Towering\\r\\nstone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a\\r\\nceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd,\\r\\ngreenish gloom that filled the place.\\r\\nHis heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence.\\r\\nCould the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And\\r\\nwhere was Ginny?\\r\\nHe pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine\\r\\ncolumns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls.\\r\\n262\\r\\nHe kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest\\r\\nsign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes\\r\\nseemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of the\\r\\nstomach, he thought he saw one stir.\\r\\nThen, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the\\r\\nChamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall.\\r\\n*306*\\r\\nHarry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It\\r\\nwas ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to\\r\\nthe bottom of the wizard\\'s sweeping stone robes, where two\\r\\nenormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between\\r\\nthe feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red\\r\\nhair.\\r\\n\"tinny!\" Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees.\\r\\n\"tinny - don\\'t be dead - please don\\'t be dead -\" He flung his wand\\r\\naside, grabbed Ginny\\'s shoulders, and turned her over. Her face was\\r\\nwhite as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn\\'t\\r\\nPetrified. But then she must be\\r\\n\"Ginny, please wake up,\" Harry muttered desperately, shaking her.\\r\\nGinny\\'s head lolled hopelessly from side to side.\\r\\n\"She won\\'t wake,\" said a soft voice.\\r\\nHarry jumped and spun around on his knees.\\r\\nA tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar,\\r\\nwatching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though\\r\\nHarry were looking at him through a misted window. But there was\\r\\nno mistaking him\\r\\n\"Tom - Tom Riddle?\"\\r\\nRiddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry\\'s face.\\r\\n\"What d\\'you mean, she won\\'t wake?\" Harry said desperately. \"She\\'s\\r\\n263\\r\\nnot - she\\'s not -?\"\\r\\n\"She\\'s still alive,\" said Riddle. \"But only just.\"\\r\\nHarry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years\\r\\nago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day\\r\\nolder than sixteen.\\r\\n\"Are you a ghost?\" Harry said uncertainly.\\r\\n* 30 7*\\r\\n\"A memory,\" said Riddle quietly. \"Preserved in a diary for fifty years.\\r\\nHe pointed toward the floor near the statue\\'s giant toes. Lying open\\r\\nthere was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle\\'s\\r\\nbathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there - but\\r\\nthere were more pressing matters to deal with.\\r\\n\"You\\'ve got to help me, Tom,\" Harry said, raising Ginny\\'s head again.\\r\\n\"We\\'ve got to get her out of here. There\\'s a basilisk ... I don\\'t know\\r\\nwhere it is, but it could be along any moment .... Please, help me -1)\\r\\nRiddle didn\\'t move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny half off\\r\\nthe floor, and bent to pick up his wand again.\\r\\nBut his wand had gone.\\r\\n\"Did you see -?\"\\r\\nHe looked up. Riddle was still watching him - twirling Harry\\'s wand\\r\\nbetween his long fingers.\\r\\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, stretching out his hand for it.\\r\\nA smile curled the corners of Riddle\\'s mouth. He continued to stare at\\r\\nHarry, twirling the wand idly.\\r\\n\"Listen,\" said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny\\'s dead\\r\\nweight. \"We\\'ve got to go! If the basilisk comes -\"\\r\\n\"It won\\'t come until it is called,\" said Riddle calmly.\\r\\n264\\r\\nHarry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any\\r\\nlonger.\\r\\n\"What d\\'you mean?\" he said. \"Look, give me my wand, I might need it\\r\\n-\"\\r\\nRiddle\\'s smile broadened.\\r\\n\"You won\\'t be needing it,\" he said.\\r\\n*%08*\\r\\nHarry stared at him.\\r\\n\"What d\\'you mean, I won\\'t be -?\"\\r\\n\"I\\'ve waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle. \"For the\\r\\nchance to see you. To speak to you.\"\\r\\n\"Look,\" said Harry, losing patience, \"I don\\'t think you get it. We\\'re in\\r\\nthe Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later -\"\\r\\n\"We\\'re going to talk now,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he\\r\\npocketed Harry\\'s wand.\\r\\nHarry stared at him. There was something very funny going on here\\r\\n....\\r\\n\"How did Ginny get like this?\" he asked slowly.\\r\\n\"Well, that\\'s an interesting question,\" said Riddle pleasantly. \"And quite\\r\\na long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley\\'s like this is\\r\\nbecause she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible\\r\\nstranger.\"\\r\\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"The diary,\" said Riddle. `My diary. Little Ginny\\'s been writing in it for\\r\\nmonths and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - how\\r\\nher brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with\\r\\nsecondhand robes and books, how\" -Riddle\\'s eyes glinted \"how she\\r\\n265\\r\\ndidn\\'t think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her . . . .\"\\r\\nAll the time he spoke, Riddle\\'s eyes never left Harry\\'s face. There\\r\\nwas an almost hungry look in them.\\r\\n\"It\\'s very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an elevenyear-\\r\\nold girl,\" he went on. \"But I was patient. I wrote back. I was\\r\\nsympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one\\'s ever\\r\\nunderstood me like you, Tom .... I\\'m so glad I\\'ve got this diary to\\r\\n*309*\\r\\nconfide in .... It\\'s like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket . . . .\\r\\nRiddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn\\'t suit him. It made the hairs\\r\\nstand up on the back of Harry\\'s neck.\\r\\n\"If I say it myself, Harry, I\\'ve always been able to charm the people I\\r\\nneeded. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to\\r\\nbe exactly what I wanted .... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of\\r\\nher deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more\\r\\npowerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding\\r\\nMiss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul\\r\\nback into her. . .\"\\r\\n\"What d\\'you mean?\" said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry.\\r\\n\" Haven\\'t you guessed yet, Harry Potter?\" said Riddle softly. \"Ginny\\r\\nWeasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school\\r\\nroosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the\\r\\nSerpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib\\'s cat.\\r\\n\"No,\" Harry whispered.\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Riddle, calmly. \"Of course, she didn\\'t know what she was\\r\\ndoing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her\\r\\nnew diary entries ... far more interesting, they became .... Dear Tom,\"\\r\\nhe recited, watching Harry\\'s horrified face, `I think I\\'m losing my\\r\\nmemory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 don\\'t know how\\r\\nthey got there. Dear Tom, l can\\'t remember what 1 did on the night of\\r\\nHalloween, but a cat was attacked and I\\'ve got paint all down my front.\\r\\nDear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I\\'m pale and I\\'m not myself. I think he\\r\\n266\\r\\nsuspects me... There was another attack today\\r\\n*310\\r\\nand I don\\'t know where I was. Tom, what am I going to do? I think I\\'m\\r\\ngoing mad... I think I\\'m the one attacking everyone, Tom!\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his Palms.\\r\\n\"it took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her\\r\\ndiary,\" said Riddle. \"But she finally became suspicious and tried to\\r\\ndispose of it. And that\\'s where you came in, Harry. You found it, and I\\r\\ncouldn\\'t have been more delighted. Of all the people who could have\\r\\npicked it up, it was you, the very person I was most anxious to meet . .\\r\\n. .\"\\r\\n\"And why did you want to meet me?\" said Harry. Anger was coursing\\r\\nthrough him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady.\\r\\n\"Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,\" said Riddle. \"Your\\r\\nwhole fascinating history. \" His eyes roved over the lightning scar on\\r\\nHarry\\'s forehead, and their expression grew hungrier. \"I knew I must\\r\\nfind out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided\\r\\nto show you my famous capture of that great oaf, Hagrid, to gain your\\r\\ntrust -\"\\r\\n\"Hagrid\\'s my friend,\" said Harry, his voice now shaking. \"And you\\r\\nframed him, didn\\'t you? I thought you made a mistake, but -\"\\r\\nRiddle laughed his high laugh again.\\r\\n\"It was my word against Hagrid\\'s, Harry. Well, you can imagine how\\r\\nit looked to old Armando Dippet. On the one hand, Tom Riddle, poor\\r\\nbut brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student ...\\r\\non the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in trouble every other week,\\r\\ntrying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to the\\r\\nForbidden Forest to wrestle trolls ... but I\\r\\n* 31:L *\\r\\nadmit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked. I thought\\r\\nsomeone must realize that Hagrid couldn\\'t possibly be the Heir of\\r\\n267\\r\\nSlytherin. It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I\\r\\ncould about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance\\r\\n... as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power!\\r\\n\"Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think\\r\\nHagrid was innocent. He persuaded Dipper to keep Hagrid and train\\r\\nhim as gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed ....\\r\\nDumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers\\r\\ndid ......\\r\\n\"I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,\" said Harry, his teeth gritted.\\r\\n\"Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid\\r\\nwas expelled,\" said Riddle carelessly. \"I knew it wouldn\\'t be safe to\\r\\nopen the Chamber again while I was still at school. But I wasn\\'t going\\r\\nto waste those long years Id spent searching for it. I decided to leave\\r\\nbehind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that\\r\\none day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and\\r\\nfinish Salazar Slytherin\\'s noble work.\"\\r\\n\"Well, you haven\\'t finished it,\" said Harry triumphantly. \"No one\\'s died\\r\\nthis time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will\\r\\nbe ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again -\"\\r\\n\"Haven\\'t I already told you,\" said Riddle quietly, \"that killing Mudbloods\\r\\ndoesn\\'t matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new target\\r\\nhas been -you.\"\\r\\nHarry stared at him.\\r\\n\"Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was\\r\\n*312*\\r\\nopened, it was Ginny who was writing to me, not you. She saw you\\r\\nwith the diary, you see, and panicked. \"What if you found out how to\\r\\nwork it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I\\r\\ntold you who\\'d been strangling roosters? So the foolish little brat waited\\r\\nuntil your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. But I knew what I\\r\\nmust do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin\\'s\\r\\nheir. From everything Ginny had told me about you, I knew you would\\r\\ngo to any lengths to solve the mystery --\\r\\n268\\r\\nparticularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ginny had\\r\\ntold me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak\\r\\nParseltongue ....\\r\\n\"So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down\\r\\nhere to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring. But\\r\\nthere isn\\'t much life left in her .... She put too much into the diary, into\\r\\nme. Enough to let me leave its pages at last .... I have been waiting for\\r\\nyou to appear since we arrived here. I knew you\\'d come. I have many\\r\\nquestions for you, Harry Potter.\"\\r\\n\"Like what?\" Harry spat, fists still clenched.\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, \"how is it that you a skinny boy\\r\\nwith no extraordinary magical talent - managed to defeat the greatest\\r\\nwizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while\\r\\nLord Voldemort\\'s powers were destroyed?\"\\r\\nThere was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.\\r\\n\"Why do you care how I escaped?\" said Harry slowly. \"Voldemort was\\r\\nafter your time ......\\r\\n\"Voldemort,\" said Riddle softly, \"is my past, present, and future, Harry\\r\\nPotter . . . .\"\\r\\nHe pulled Harry\\'s wand from his pocket and began to trace it\\r\\nthrough the air, writing three shimmering words:\\r\\nTOM MARVOLO RIDDLE\\r\\nThen he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name\\r\\nrearranged themselves:\\r\\nI AM LORD VOLDEMORT\\r\\n\"You see?\" he whispered. \"It was a name I was already using at\\r\\nHogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I\\r\\nwas going to use my filthy Muggle father\\'s name forever? I, in whose\\r\\nveins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my\\r\\nmother\\'s side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who\\r\\n269\\r\\nabandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his\\r\\nwife was a witch? No, Harry - I fashioned myself a new name, a\\r\\nname I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,\\r\\nwhen I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle,\\r\\nat the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry\\'s own\\r\\nparents, and so many others .... At last he forced himself to -,peak.\\r\\n\"You\\'re not,\" he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.\\r\\n\"Not what?\" snapped Riddle.\\r\\n\"Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,\" said Harry, breathing fast.\\r\\n\"Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the\\r\\nworld is Albus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you were\\r\\nstrong, you didn\\'t dare try and take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledore\\r\\nsaw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you\\r\\nnow, wherever you\\'re hiding these days -\"\\r\\nThe smile had gone from Riddle\\'s face, to be replaced by a very ugly\\r\\nlook.\\r\\n*31-4*\\r\\n\"Dumbledore\\'s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of\\r\\nme!\" he hissed.\\r\\n\"He\\'s not as gone as you might think!\" Harry retorted. He was\\r\\nspeaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, wishing rather than\\r\\nbelieving it to be true\\r\\nRiddle opened his mouth, but froze.\\r\\nMusic was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled around to stare\\r\\ndown the empty Chamber. The music was growing louder. It was\\r\\neerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry\\'s scalp and\\r\\nmade his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size.\\r\\nThen, as the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibrating\\r\\ninside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar.\\r\\nA crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music\\r\\n270\\r\\nto the vaulted ceiling. It had a glittering golden tail as long as a\\r\\npeacock\\'s and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged\\r\\nbundle.\\r\\nA second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It dropped the\\r\\nragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on his\\r\\nshoulder. As it folded its great wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a\\r\\nlong, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye.\\r\\nThe bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to Harry\\'s cheek,\\r\\ngazing steadily at Riddle.\\r\\n\"That\\'s a phoenix said Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it.\\r\\n\"Fawkes?\" Harry breathed, and he felt the bird\\'s golden claws\\r\\nsqueeze his shoulder gently\\r\\n\"And that -\" said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had\\r\\ndropped, \"that\\'s the old school Sorting Hat -\"\\r\\nSo it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry\\'s\\r\\nfeet.\\r\\nRiddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark\\r\\nchamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at once\\r\\n\"This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old\\r\\nhat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?\"\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t answer. He might not see what use Fawkes or the\\r\\nSorting Hat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited for\\r\\nRiddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting.\\r\\n\"To business, Harry,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly. \"Twice - in your\\r\\npast, in my future - we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How\\r\\ndid you survive? Tell me everything. The longer you talk,\" he added\\r\\nsoftly, \"the longer you stay alive.\"\\r\\nHarry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle had the wand.\\r\\nHe, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would\\r\\nbe much good in a duel. It looked bad, all right ... but the longer Riddle\\r\\nstood there, the more life was dwindling out of Ginny ... and in the\\r\\n271\\r\\nmeantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle\\'s outline was becoming\\r\\nclearer, more solid .... If it had to be a fight between him and Riddle,\\r\\nbetter sooner than later.\\r\\n\"No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,\"\\r\\nsaid Harry abruptly. \"I don\\'t know myself But I know why you\\r\\ncouldn\\'t kill me. Because my mother died to save me. My common\\r\\nMuggle-born mother,\" he added, shaking with suppressed rage. \"She\\r\\nstopped you killing me. And I\\'ve seen the real you, I saw you last\\r\\nyear. You\\'re a wreck. You\\'re barely alive. That\\'s where all your\\r\\npower got you. You\\'re in hiding. You\\'re ugly, you\\'re foul -\"\\r\\n*%16*\\r\\nRiddle\\'s face contorted. Then he forced it into an awful smile. \"So.\\r\\nYour mother died to save you. Yes, that\\'s a powerful countercharm. I\\r\\ncan see now ... there is nothing special about you, after all. I\\r\\nwondered, you see. There are strange likenesses between us, after all.\\r\\nEven you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by\\r\\nMuggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts\\r\\nsince the great Slytherin himself We even look something alike ... but\\r\\nafter all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me. That\\'s\\r\\nall I wanted to know.\"\\r\\nHarry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand. But Riddle\\'s\\r\\ntwisted smile was widening again.\\r\\n\"Now, Harry, I\\'m going to teach you a little lesson. Let\\'s match the\\r\\npowers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against famous\\r\\nHarry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him . . . .\"\\r\\nHe cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then walked\\r\\naway. Harry, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched Ridthe stop\\r\\nbetween the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin,\\r\\nhigh above him in the half-darkness. Riddle opened his mouth wide and\\r\\nhissed - but Harry understood what he was saying ....\\r\\n\"Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four. \"\\r\\nHarry wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on his\\r\\nshoulder.\\r\\n272\\r\\nSlytherin\\'s gigantic stone face was moving. Horrorstruck, Harry saw\\r\\nhis mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole.\\r\\nAnd something was stirring inside the statue\\'s mouth. Something\\r\\nwas slithering up from its depths. 3 1\\r\\nHarry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shut\\r\\nhis eyes tight he felt Fawkes\\' wing sweep his cheek as he took flight.\\r\\nHarry wanted to shout, \"Don\\'t leave me!\" but what chance did a\\r\\nphoenix have against the king of serpents?\\r\\nSomething huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt it\\r\\nshudder - he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could\\r\\nalmost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin\\'s mouth.\\r\\nThen he heard Riddle\\'s hissing voice:\\r\\n\"Kill him. \"\\r\\nThe basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy body\\r\\nslithering heavily across the dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry\\r\\nbegan to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way -\\r\\nVoldemort was laughing\\r\\nHarry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent\\r\\nwas barely feet from him, he could hear it coming\\r\\nThere was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then\\r\\nsomething heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall.\\r\\nWaiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing,\\r\\nsomething thrashing wildly off the pillars\\r\\nHe couldn\\'t help it - he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what\\r\\nwas going on.\\r\\nThe enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk,\\r\\nhad raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving\\r\\ndrunkenly between the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close his\\r\\neyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake.\\r\\nFawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping\\r\\nfuriously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers\\r\\n273\\r\\nFawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight and a\\r\\n*318*\\r\\nsudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor. The snake\\'s tail\\r\\nthrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut his\\r\\neyes, it turned - Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its\\r\\neyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the\\r\\nphoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting\\r\\nin agony.\\r\\n\"NO!\" Harry heard Riddle screaming. \"LEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE\\r\\nTHE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. YOU CAN STILL SMELL\\r\\nHIM. KILL HIMI\"\\r\\nThe blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. Fawkes was\\r\\ncircling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at its\\r\\nscaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes.\\r\\n\"Help me, help me,\" Harry muttered wildly, \"someone - anyone\\r\\nThe snake\\'s tail whipped across the floor again. Harry ducked.\\r\\nSomething soft hit his face.\\r\\nThe basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry\\'s arms. Harry\\r\\nseized it. It was all he had left, his only chance - he rammed it onto his\\r\\nhead and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk\\'s tail swung\\r\\nover him again.\\r\\nHelp me - help me - Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat.\\r\\nPlease help me\\r\\nThere was no answering voice. Instead, the hat contracted, as though\\r\\nan invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly.\\r\\nSomething very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry\\'s head,\\r\\nalmost knocking him out. Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed\\r\\nthe top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard\\r\\nbeneath it.\\r\\n3 19\\r\\n274\\r\\nA gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle\\r\\nglittering with rubies the size of eggs.\\r\\n\"KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU.\\r\\nSNIFF -- SMELL HIM.\"\\r\\nHarry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk\\'s head was falling, its body\\r\\ncoiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him. He could see the\\r\\nvast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough\\r\\nto swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin,\\r\\nglittering, venomous -\\r\\nIt lunged blindly -- Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. It lunged\\r\\nagain, and its forked tongue lashed Harry\\'s side. He raised the sword\\r\\nin both his hands -\\r\\nThe basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true -- Harry threw\\r\\nhis whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof\\r\\nof the serpent\\'s mouth -\\r\\nBut as warm blood drenched Harry\\'s arms, he felt a searing pain just\\r\\nabove his elbow. One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper and\\r\\ndeeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over\\r\\nsideways and fell, twitching, to the floor.\\r\\nHarry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreading\\r\\npoison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he knew it\\r\\nwas too late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from\\r\\nthe wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood\\r\\nsoaking his robes, his vision went foggy. The Chamber was dissolving\\r\\nin a whirl of dull color.\\r\\nA patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws\\r\\nbeside him.\\r\\n\"Fawkes,\" said Harry thickly. \"You were fantastic, Fawkes . . . .\"\\r\\n1,520\\r\\nHe felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent\\'s\\r\\nfang had pierced him.\\r\\n275\\r\\nHe could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in\\r\\nfront of him.\\r\\n\"You\\'re dead, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle\\'s voice above him. \"Dead.\\r\\nEven Dumbledore\\'s bird knows it. Do you see what he\\'s doing, Potter?\\r\\nHe\\'s crying.\"\\r\\nHarry blinked. Fawke\\'s head slid in and out of focus. Thick, pearly tears\\r\\nwere trickling down the glossy feathers.\\r\\n\"I\\'m going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your time.\\r\\nI\\'m in no hurry.\"\\r\\nHarry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning.\\r\\n\"So ends the famous Harry Potter,\" said Riddle\\'s distant voice. \"Alone\\r\\nin the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by\\r\\nthe Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You\\'ll be back with your dear\\r\\nMudblood mother soon, Harry... She bought you twelve years of\\r\\nborrowed time ... but Lord Voldemort got you in the end, as you knew\\r\\nhe must . . . .\"\\r\\nIf this is dying, thought Harry, it\\'s not so bad.\\r\\nEven the pain was leaving him ....\\r\\nBut was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to be\\r\\ncoming back into focus. Harry gave his head a little shake and there was\\r\\nFawkes, still resting his head on Harry\\'s arm. A pearly patch of tears was\\r\\nshining all around the wound -- except that there was no wound\\r\\n\"Get away, bird,\" said Riddle\\'s voice suddenly. \"Get away from him -\\r\\nI said, get away --\"\\r\\nHarry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry\\'s wand at\\r\\nFawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a\\r\\nwhirl of gold and scarlet.\\r\\n\"Phoenix tears. - .\" said Riddle quietly, staring at Harry\\'s arm. \"Of\\r\\ncourse ... healing powers ... I forgot. . .\"\\r\\n276\\r\\nHe looked into Harry\\'s face. \"But it makes no difference. In fact, I\\r\\nprefer it this way. Just you and me, Harry Potter ... you and me....\\r\\nHe raised the wand\\r\\nThen, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and\\r\\nsomething fell into Harry\\'s lap -- the diary.\\r\\nFor a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it.\\r\\nThen, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to\\r\\ndo it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him\\r\\nand plunged it straight into the heart of the book.\\r\\nThere was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of the\\r\\ndiary in torrents, streaming over Harry\\'s hands, flooding the floor.\\r\\nRiddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then\\r\\nHe had gone. Harry\\'s wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there\\r\\nwas silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing\\r\\nfrom the diary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right\\r\\nthrough it.\\r\\nShaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning as\\r\\nthough he\\'d just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gathered\\r\\ntogether his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved\\r\\nthe glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk\\'s mouth.\\r\\nThen came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. Ginny was\\r\\nstirring. As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up. Her bemused\\r\\n1,522\\r\\neyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in\\r\\nhis blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a great,\\r\\nshuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face.\\r\\n\"Harry -- oh, Harry -- I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn\\'t\\r\\nsay it in front of Percy -- it was me, Harry -- but I -- I s-swear I ddiddt\\r\\nmean to -- R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over -- and - how\\r\\ndid you kill that -- that thing? W-where\\'s Riddle? The last thing I rremember\\r\\nis him coming out of the diary --\"\\r\\n277\\r\\n\" It\\'s all right,\" said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the\\r\\nfang hole, \"Riddle\\'s finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. C\\'mon,\\r\\nGinny, let\\'s get out of here --\"\\r\\n\"I\\'m going to be expelled!\" Ginny wept as Harry helped her\\r\\nawkwardly to her feet. \"I\\'ve looked forward to coming to Hogwarts\\r\\never since B-Bill came and n-now I\\'ll have to leave and -- w-what\\'ll\\r\\nMum and Dad say?\"\\r\\nFawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance.\\r\\nHarry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of\\r\\nthe dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel.\\r\\nHarry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss.\\r\\nAfter a few minutes\\' progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound of\\r\\nslowly shifting rock reached Harry\\'s ears.\\r\\n\"Ron!\" Harry yelled, speeding up. \"Ginny\\'s okay! I\\'ve got her!\"\\r\\nHe heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to\\r\\nsee his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to\\r\\nmake in the rock fall.\\r\\n\"Ginny!\" Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull\\r\\n321,3\\r\\nher through first. \"You\\'re alive! I don\\'t believe it! What happened?\"\\r\\nHow - what -- where did that bird come from?\"\\r\\nFawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny.\\r\\n\"He\\'s Dumbledore\\'s,\" said Harry, squeezing through himself\\r\\n\"How come you\\'ve got a sword?\" said Ron, gaping at the glittering\\r\\nweapon in Harry\\'s hand.\\r\\n\"I\\'ll explain when we get out of here,\" said Harry with a sideways\\r\\nglance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever.\\r\\n\"But --\"\\r\\n278\\r\\n\"Later,\" Harry said shortly. He didn\\'t think it was a good idea to tell\\r\\nRon yet who\\'d been opening the Chamber, not in front of Ginny,\\r\\nanyway. \"Where\\'s Lockhart?\"\\r\\n\"Back there,\" said Ron, still looking puzzled but jerking his head up the\\r\\ntunnel toward the pipe. \"He\\'s in a bad way. Come and see.\"\\r\\nLed by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow\\r\\nin the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe.\\r\\nGilderoy Lockhart was sitting there, humming placidly to himself.\\r\\n\"His memory\\'s gone,\" said Ron. \"The Memory Charm backfired. Hit\\r\\nhim instead of us. Hasn\\'t got a clue who he is, or where he is, or who\\r\\nwe are. I told him to come and wait here. He\\'s a danger to himself\"\\r\\nLockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all.\\r\\n\"Hello,\" he said. \"Odd sort of place, this, isn\\'t it? Do you live here?\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry.\\r\\nHarry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe.\\r\\n\"Have you thought how we\\'re going to get back up this?\" he said to\\r\\nRon.\\r\\n*324*\\r\\nRon shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harry\\r\\nand was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright in the\\r\\ndark. He was waving his long golden tail feathers. Harry looked\\r\\nuncertainly at him.\\r\\n\"He looks like he wants you to grab hold. . .\" said Ron, looking\\r\\nperplexed. \"But you\\'re much too heavy for a bird to pull up there -\"\\r\\n\"Fawkes,\" said Harry, \"isn\\'t an ordinary bird.\" He turned quickly to the\\r\\nothers. \"We\\'ve got to hold on to each other. Ginny, grab Ron\\'s hand.\\r\\nProfessor Lockhart --\"\\r\\n\"He means you,\" said Ron sharply to Lockhart.\\r\\n279\\r\\n\"You hold Ginny\\'s other hand --\"\\r\\nHarry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron took\\r\\nhold of the back of Harry\\'s robes, and Harry reached out and took\\r\\nhold of Fawkes\\'s strangely hot tail feathers.\\r\\nAn extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole body\\r\\nand the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upward\\r\\nthrough the pipe. Harry could hear Lockhart dangling below him,\\r\\nsaying, \"Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!\" The chill air was\\r\\nwhipping through Harry\\'s hair, and before he\\'d stopped enjoying the\\r\\nride, it was over -- all four of them were hitting the wet floor of\\r\\nMoaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened his hat, the\\r\\nsink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place.\\r\\nMyrtle goggled at them.\\r\\n\"You\\'re alive,\" she said blankly to Harry.\\r\\n\"There\\'s no need to sound so disappointed,\" he said grimly, wiping\\r\\nflecks of blood and slime off his glasses.\\r\\n* 325*\\r\\n\"Oh, well ... Id just been thinking ... if you had died, you\\'d have been\\r\\nwelcome to share my toilet,\" said Myrtle, blushing silver.\\r\\n\"Urgh!\" said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, deserted\\r\\ncorridor outside. \"Harry! I think Myrtle\\'s grown fond of you! You\\'ve\\r\\ngot competition, Ginny!\"\\r\\nBut tears were still flooding silently down Ginny\\'s face.\\r\\n\"Where now?\" said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny. Harry pointed.\\r\\nFawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor. They\\r\\nstrode after him, and moments later, found themselves outside\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall\\'s office.\\r\\nHarry knocked and pushed the door open.\\r\\nG F-I A P T E IR\\r\\n280\\r\\nk\\' I G 14 T V V N\\r\\nDO\\r\\nY\\'$ REWARD\\r\\nor a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart\\r\\nstood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in Harry\\'s case)\\r\\nblood. Then there was a scream.\\r\\n\"Ginny!\"\\r\\nIt was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the fire.\\r\\nShe leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of\\r\\nthem flung themselves on their daughter.\\r\\nHarry, however, was looking past them. Professor Dumbledore was\\r\\nstanding by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor McGonagall,\\r\\nwho was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest. Fawkes\\r\\nwent whooshing past Harry\\'s ear and settled on Dumbledore\\'s\\r\\nshoulder, just as Harry found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs.\\r\\nWeasleys tight embrace.\\r\\n\"You saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?\"\\r\\n\"I think we\\'d all like to know that,\" said Professor McGonagall weakly.\\r\\nMrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a moment, then\\r\\nwalked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the\\r\\nrubyencrusted sword, and what remained of Riddle\\'s diary.\\r\\nThen he started telling them everything. For nearly a quarter of an\\r\\nhour he spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing the\\r\\ndisembodied voice, how Hermione had finally realized that he was\\r\\nhearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed the\\r\\nspiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the last\\r\\nvictim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning\\r\\n281\\r\\nMyrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of\\r\\nSecrets might be in her bathroom ....\\r\\n\"Very well,\" Professor McGonagall prompted him as he paused, \"so\\r\\nyou found out where the entrance was -- breaking a hundred school\\r\\nrules into pieces along the way, I might add - but how on earth did\\r\\nyou all get out of there alive, Potter?\"\\r\\nSo Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told\\r\\nthem about Fawkes\\'s timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving\\r\\nhim the sword. But then he faltered. He had so far avoided\\r\\nmentioning Riddle\\'s diary -- or Ginny. She was standing with her\\r\\nhead against Mrs. Weasley\\'s shoulder, and tears were still coursing\\r\\nsilently down her cheeks. What if they expelled her? Harry thought in\\r\\npanic. Riddle\\'s diary didn\\'t work anymore .... How could they prove\\r\\nit had been he who\\'d made her do it all?\\r\\nInstinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly, the\\r\\nfirelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles.\\r\\n\"\\\\What interests me most,\" said Dumbledore gently, \"is how Lord\\r\\nVoldemort managed to enchant Ginny, when my sources tell me he is\\r\\ncurrently in hiding in the forests of Albania.\"\\r\\n*328*\\r\\nRelief -- warm, sweeping, glorious relief -- swept over Harry. \"Wwhat\\'s\\r\\nthat?\" said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice. \"YouKnow-Who?\\r\\nEn-enchant Ginny? But Ginny\\'s not ... Ginny hasn\\'t been ... has she?\"\\r\\n\"It was this diary,\" said Harry quickly, picking it up and showing it to\\r\\nDumbledore. \"Riddle wrote it when he was sixteen . . . .\"\\r\\nDumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down his\\r\\nlong, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages.\\r\\n\"Brilliant,\" he said softly. \"Of course, he was probably the most\\r\\nbrilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.\" He turned around to the\\r\\nWeasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered.\\r\\n\"Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom\\r\\nRiddle. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He\\r\\n282\\r\\ndisappeared after leaving the school ... traveled far and wide ... sank\\r\\nso deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our\\r\\nkind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that\\r\\nwhen he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable.\\r\\nHardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever,\\r\\nhandsome boy who was once Head Boy here.\"\\r\\n\"But, Ginny,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"What\\'s our Ginny got to do with -\\r\\nwith -- him?\"\\r\\n\"His d-diaryl\" Ginny sobbed. \"I\\'ve b-been writing in it, and he\\'s been\\r\\nw-writing back all year --\"\\r\\n\"tinny!\" said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. \"Haven\\'t I taught you\\r\\nanything. What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can\\r\\nthink for itself if you can\\'t see where it keeps its brain? Why didn\\'t\\r\\nyou show the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious object like\\r\\nthat, it was clearly full of Dark Magic =\\'\\r\\n*329*\\r\\n\"I d-didn\\'t know,\" sobbed Ginny. \"I found it inside one of the books\\r\\nMum got me. I th-thought someone had just left it in there and\\r\\nforgotten about it --\"\\r\\n\"Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,\"\\r\\nDumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. \"This has been a terrible\\r\\nordeal for her. There will be no punishment. Older and wiser wizards\\r\\nthan she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.\" He strode over\\r\\nto the door and opened it. \"Bed rest and perhaps a large, steaming\\r\\nmug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up,\" he added,\\r\\ntwinkling kindly down at her. \"You will find that Madam Pomfrey is\\r\\nstill awake. She\\'s just giving out Mandrake juice -- I daresay the\\r\\nbasilisk\\'s victims will be waking up any moment.\"\\r\\n\"So Hermione\\'s okay!\" said Ron brightly.\\r\\n\"There has been no lasting harm done, Ginny,\" said Dumbledore.\\r\\nMrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley followed, still looking\\r\\ndeeply shaken.\\r\\n283\\r\\n\"You know, Minerva,\" Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully to\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall, \"I think all this merits a good feast. Might I ask\\r\\nyou to go and alert the kitchens?\"\\r\\n\"Right,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door.\\r\\n\"I\\'ll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?\"\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" said Dumbledore.\\r\\nShe left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore. What\\r\\nexactly had Professor McGonagall meant, deal with them? Surely -\\r\\nsurely - they weren\\'t about to be punished?\\r\\n\"I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if\\r\\nyou broke any more school rules, said Dumbledore.\\r\\n*%30*\\r\\nRon opened his mouth in horror.\\r\\n\"Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our\\r\\nwords,\" Dumbledore went on, smiling. \"You will both receive Special\\r\\nAwards for Services to the School and -- let me see - yes, I think two\\r\\nhundred points apiece for Gryffindor.\"\\r\\nRon went as briglitly pink as Lockhart\\'s valentine flowers and closed\\r\\nhis mouth again.\\r\\n\"But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this\\r\\ndangerous adventure,\" Dumbledore added. \"Why so modest,\\r\\nGilderoy?\"\\r\\nHarry gave a start. He had completely forgotten about Lockhart. He\\r\\nturned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room,\\r\\nstill wearing his vague smile. When Dumbledore addressed him,\\r\\nLockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to.\\r\\n\"Professor Dumbledore,\" Ron said quickly, \"there was an accident\\r\\ndown in the Chamber of Secrets. Professor Lockhart --\"\\r\\n\"Am I a professor?\" said Lockhart in mild surprise. \"Goodness. I\\r\\nexpect I was hopeless, was I?\"\\r\\n284\\r\\n\"He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired,\" Ron\\r\\nexplained quietly to Dumbledore.\\r\\n\"Dear me,\" said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silver\\r\\nmustache quivering. \"Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy!\"\\r\\n\"Sword?\" said Lockhart dimly. \"Haven\\'t got a sword. That boy has,\\r\\nthough.\" He pointed at Harry. \"He\\'ll lend you one.\"\\r\\n\"Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infirmary, too?\"\\r\\nDumbledore said to Ron. \"Id like a few more words with Harry .....\\r\\nLockhart ambled out. Ron cast a curious look back at Dumbledore and\\r\\nHarry as he closed the door.\\r\\nDumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire.\\r\\n\"Sit down, Harry,\" he said, and Harry sat, feeling unaccountably\\r\\nnervous.\\r\\n\"First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,\" said Dumbledore, eyes\\r\\ntwinkling again. \"You must have shown me real loyalty down in the\\r\\nChamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.\"\\r\\nHe stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee.\\r\\nHarry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him.\\r\\n\"And so you met Tom Riddle,\" said Dumbledore thoughtfully. \"I\\r\\nimagine he was most interested in you . . . . \"\\r\\nSuddenly, something that was nagging at Harry came tumbling out of\\r\\nhis mouth.\\r\\n\"Professor Dumbledore ... Riddle said I\\'m like him. Strange likenesses,\\r\\nhe said ......\\r\\n\"Did he, now?\" said Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully at Harry from\\r\\nunder his thick silver eyebrows. \"And what do you think, Harry?\"\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think I\\'m like him!\" said Harry, more loudly than he\\'d intended.\\r\\n\"I mean, I\\'m -- I\\'m in Gryffindor, I\\'m . . .\"\\r\\n285\\r\\nBut he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind.\\r\\n\"Professor,\" he started again after a moment. \"The Sorting Hat told me\\r\\nId -- Id have done well in Slytherin. Everyone thought I was Slytherin\\'s\\r\\nheir for a while ... because I can speak Parseltongue ....\\r\\n\"You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,\" said Dumbledore calmly,\\r\\n\"because Lord Voldemort -- who is the last remaining ancestor\\r\\n*$32*\\r\\nof Salazar Slytherin -- can speak Parseltongue. Unless I\\'m much\\r\\nmistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he\\r\\ngave you that scar. Not something he intended to do, I\\'m sure ....\\r\\n\"Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?\" Harry said, thunderstruck.\\r\\n\"It certainly seems so.\"\\r\\n\"So I should be in Slytherin,\" Harry said, looking desperately into\\r\\nDumbledore\\'s face. \"The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin\\'s power in\\r\\nme, and it --\"\\r\\n\"Put you in Gryffindor,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Listen to me, Harry.\\r\\nYou happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his handpicked\\r\\nstudents. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue -\\r\\nresourcefulness - determination -- a certain disregard for rules,\" he\\r\\nadded, his mustache quivering again. \"Yet the Sorting Hat placed you\\r\\nin Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.\"\\r\\n\"It only put me in Gryffindor,\" said Harry in a defeated voice, \"because\\r\\nI asked not to go in Slytherin . . . .\"\\r\\n`Exactly, \"said Dumbledore, beaming once more. \"Which makes you\\r\\nvery different from Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that show what\\r\\nwe truly are, far more than our abilities.\" Harry sat motionless in his\\r\\nchair, stunned. \"If you want proof, Harry, that you belong in\\r\\nGryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.\"\\r\\nDumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall\\'s desk, picked\\r\\nup the blood-stained silver sword, and handed it to Harry. Dully, Harry\\r\\n286\\r\\nturned it over, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And then he saw the\\r\\nname engraved just below the hilt.\\r\\nGodric Gryffindor\\r\\n*333*\\r\\n\"Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry,\"\\r\\nsaid Dumbledore simply.\\r\\nFor a minute, neither of them spoke. Then Dumbledore pulled open\\r\\none of the drawers in Professor McGonagall\\'s desk and took out a quill\\r\\nand a bottle of ink.\\r\\nWhat you need, Harry, is some food and sleep. I suggest you go down\\r\\nto the feast, while I write to Azkaban -- we need our gamekeeper\\r\\nback. And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, too,\" he\\r\\nadded thoughtfully. \"We\\'ll be needing a new Defense Against the\\r\\nDark Arts teacher... Dear me, we do seem to run through them, don\\'t\\r\\nwe?\"\\r\\nHarry got up and crossed to the door. He had just reached for the\\r\\nhandle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bounced\\r\\nback off the wall.\\r\\nLucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his face. And cowering behind his\\r\\nlegs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was Dobby.\\r\\n\"Good evening, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly.\\r\\nMr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept into the room.\\r\\nDobby went scurrying in after him, crouching at the hem of his cloak,\\r\\na look of abject terror on his face.\\r\\nThe elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting to\\r\\nfinish cleaning Mr. Malfoys shoes. Apparently Mr. Malfoy had set out\\r\\nin a great hurry, for not only were his shoes half-polished, but his\\r\\nusually sleek hair was disheveled. Ignoring the elf bobbing\\r\\napologetically around his ankles, he fixed his cold eyes upon\\r\\nDumbledore.\\r\\n\"So!\" he said \"You\\'ve come back. The governors suspended you, but\\r\\n287\\r\\nyou still saw fit to return to Hogwarts.\"\\r\\n*%$4*\\r\\n\"Well, you see, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore, smiling serenely, \"the\\r\\nother eleven governors contacted me today. It was something like\\r\\nbeing caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They\\'d heard that\\r\\nArthur Weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back here\\r\\nat once. They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after\\r\\nall. Very strange tales they told me, too .... Several of them seemed\\r\\nto think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn\\'t\\r\\nagree to suspend me in the first place.\"\\r\\nMr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still slits of\\r\\nfury.\\r\\n\"So -- have you stopped the attacks yet?\" he sneered. \"Have you\\r\\ncaught the culprit?\"\\r\\n\"We have,\" said Dumbledore, with a smile.\\r\\n\"Well?\"said Mr. Malfoy sharply. \"Who is it?\"\\r\\n\"The same person as last time, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore. \"But this\\r\\ntime, Lord Voldemort was acting through somebody else. By means\\r\\nof this diary.\"\\r\\nHe held up the small black book with the large hole through the\\r\\ncenter, watching Mr. Malfoy closely. Harry, however, was watching\\r\\nDobby.\\r\\nThe elf was doing something very odd. His great eyes fixed\\r\\nmeaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the diary, then at Mr.\\r\\nMalfoy, and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist.\\r\\n\"I see. . . \" said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore.\\r\\n\"A clever plan,\" said Dumbledore in a level voice, still staring Mr.\\r\\nMalfoy straight in the eye. \"Because if Harry here\" --Mr. Malfoy shot\\r\\nHarry a swift, sharp look -- \"and his friend Ron hadn\\'t discovered\\r\\nthis book, why -- Ginny Weasley might have taken all\\r\\n288\\r\\n*335*\\r\\nthe blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn\\'t\\r\\nacted of her own free will ......\\r\\nMr. Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly masklike.\\r\\n\"And imagine,\" Dumbledore went on, \"what might have happened\\r\\nthen .... The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-blood\\r\\nfamilies. Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle\\r\\nProtection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and -\\r\\nkilling Muggle-borns .... Very fortunate the diary was discovered,\\r\\nand Riddle\\'s memories wiped from it. \"Who knows what the\\r\\nconsequences might have been otherwise ......\\r\\nMr. Malfoy forced himself to speak.\\r\\n\"Very fortunate,\" he said stiffly.\\r\\nAnd still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first to the diary,\\r\\nthen to Lucius Malfoy, then punching himself in the head.\\r\\nAnd Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at Dobby, and Dobby\\r\\nbacked into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr.\\r\\nMalfoy?\" said Harry.\\r\\nLucius Malfoy rounded on him.\\r\\n\"How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?\" he said.\\r\\n\"Because you gave it to her,\" said Harry. \"In Flourish and Blotts.\\r\\nYou picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary\\r\\ninside it, didn\\'t you?\"\\r\\nHe saw Mr. Malfoy\\'s white hands clench and unclench.\\r\\n\"Prove it,\" he hissed.\\r\\n\"Oh, no one will be able to do that,\" said Dumbledore, smiling at\\r\\nHarry. \"Not now that Riddle has vanished from the book. On\\r\\n289\\r\\n*336*\\r\\nthe other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any\\r\\nmore of Lord Voldemort\\'s old school things. If any more of them find\\r\\ntheir way into innocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley, for one, will\\r\\nmake sure they are traced back to you ......\\r\\nLucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry distinctly saw his right\\r\\nhand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand. Instead,\\r\\nhe turned to his house-elf\\r\\n\"We\\'re going, Dobby!\"\\r\\nHe wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him,\\r\\nhe kicked him right through it. They could hear Dobby squealing with\\r\\npain all the way along the corridor. Harry stood for a moment,\\r\\nthinking hard. Then it came to him -\\r\\n\"Professor Dumbledore,\" he said hurriedly. \"Can I give that diary\\r\\nback to Mr. Malfoy, please?\"\\r\\n\"Certainly, Harry,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"But hurry. The feast,\\r\\nremember ......\\r\\nHarry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office. He could hear\\r\\nDobby\\'s squeals of pain receding around the corner. Quickly,\\r\\nwondering if this plan could possibly work, Harry took off one of his\\r\\nshoes, pulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into it.\\r\\nThen he ran down the dark corridor.\\r\\nHe caught up with them at the top of the stairs.\\r\\n\"Mr. Malfoy,\" he gasped, skidding to a halt, \"I\\'ve got something for\\r\\nyou --\"\\r\\nAnd he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy\\'s hand.\\r\\n\")What the --?\"\\r\\nMr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then looked\\r\\nfuriously from the ruined book to Harry.\\r\\n290\\r\\n*\\',531*\\r\\nYou\\'ll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days,\\r\\nHarry Potter,\" he said softly. \"They were meddlesome fools, too.\\r\\nHe turned to go.\\r\\n\"Come, Dobby. I said, come.\"\\r\\nBut Dobby didn\\'t move. He was holding up Harry\\'s disgusting, slimy\\r\\nsock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure.\\r\\n\"Master has given a sock,\" said the elf in wonderment. \"Master gave\\r\\nit to Dobby.\"\\r\\n\"What\\'s that?\" spat Mr. Malfoy. \"What did you say?\"\\r\\n\"Got a sock,\" said Dobby in disbelief. \"Master threw it, and Dobby\\r\\ncaught it, and Dobby -- Dobby is free. \"\\r\\nLucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf Then he lunged at\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\n\"You\\'ve lost me my servant, boy!\"\\r\\nBut Dobby shouted, \"You shall not harm Harry Potter!\"\\r\\nThere was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He\\r\\ncrashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap\\r\\non the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his\\r\\nwand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.\\r\\n\"You shall go now,\" he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy.\\r\\n\"You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.\"\\r\\nLucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair\\r\\nof them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.\\r\\n\"Harry Potter freed Dobby!\" said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry,\\r\\nmoonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes.\\r\\n\"Harry Potter set Dobby free!\"\\r\\n291\\r\\n\"Least I could do, Dobby,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Just promise never\\r\\nto try and save my life again.\"\\r\\nThe elf\\'s ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve just got one question, Dobby,\" said Harry as Dobby pulled on\\r\\nHarry\\'s sock with shaking hands. \"You told me all this had nothing to\\r\\ndo with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well --\"\\r\\n\"It was a clue, sir,\" said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this was\\r\\nobvious. \"Was giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he changed\\r\\nhis name, could be freely named, you see?\"\\r\\n\"Right,\" said Harry weakly. \"Well, Id better go. There\\'s a feast, and\\r\\nmy friend Hermione should be awake by now .....\\r\\nDobby threw his arms around Harry\\'s middle and hugged him.\\r\\n\"Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!\" he sobbed.\\r\\n\"Farewell, Harry Potter!\"\\r\\nAnd with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared.\\r\\nHarry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like\\r\\nthis. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all\\r\\nnight. Harry didn\\'t know whether the best bit was Hermione running\\r\\ntoward him, screaming \"You solved it! You solved it!\" or Justin\\r\\nhurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring. his hand and\\r\\napologize endlessly for suspecting him, or Hagrid turning up at half\\r\\npast three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they\\r\\nwere knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and Ron\\'s four hundred\\r\\npoints for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year\\r\\nrunning, or Professor McGonagall standing up to\\r\\n*339*\\r\\ntell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat (\"Oh,\\r\\nno!\" said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately,\\r\\nProfessor Lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to the\\r\\nfact that he needed to go away and get his memory back. Quite a few\\r\\nof the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news.\\r\\n292\\r\\n\"Shame,\" said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut. \"He was\\r\\nstarting to grow on me.\"\\r\\nThe rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine.\\r\\nHogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences -\\r\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled (\"but we\\'ve\\r\\nhad plenty of practice at that anyway,\" Ron told a disgruntled\\r\\nHermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school governor.\\r\\nDraco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned\\r\\nthe place. On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. On the other\\r\\nhand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again.\\r\\nToo soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express.\\r\\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to\\r\\nthemselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which they\\r\\nwere allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding\\r\\nSnap, set off the very last of Fred and George\\'s Filibuster fireworks,\\r\\nand practiced disarming each other by magic. Harry was getting very\\r\\ngood at it.\\r\\nThey were almost at King\\'s Cross when Harry remembered\\r\\nsomething.\\r\\n\"Ginny - what did you see Percy doing, that he didn\\'t want you to tell\\r\\nanyone?\"\\r\\n*340*\\r\\n\"Oh, that,\" said Ginny, giggling. \"Well - Percy\\'s got a girlfriend.\" Fred\\r\\ndropped a stack of books on George\\'s head.\\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n\"It\\'s that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater,\" said Ginny.\\r\\n\"That\\'s who he was writing to all last summer. He\\'s been meeting her\\r\\nall over the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty\\r\\nclassroom one day. He was so upset when she was -- you know -\\r\\nattacked. You won\\'t tease him, will you?\" she added anxiously.\\r\\n\"Wouldn\\'t dream of it,\" said Fred, who was looking like his birthday\\r\\nhad come early.\\r\\n293\\r\\n\"Definitely not,\" said George, sniggering.\\r\\nThe Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped.\\r\\nHarry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron\\r\\nand Hermione.\\r\\n\"This is called a telephone number,\" he told Ron, scribbling it twice,\\r\\ntearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them. \"I told your dad\\r\\nhow to use a telephone last summer - he\\'ll know. Call me at the\\r\\nDursleys\\', okay? I can\\'t stand another two months with only Dudley\\r\\nto talk to ......\\r\\n\"Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won\\'t they?\" said\\r\\nHermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging\\r\\ntoward the enchanted barrier. \"When they hear what you did this\\r\\nyear?\"\\r\\n\"Proud?\" said Harry. \"Are you crazy? All those times I could\\'ve\\r\\ndied, and I didn\\'t manage it? They\\'ll be furious ......\\r\\nAnd together they walked back through the gateway to the Muggle\\r\\nworld. \\'\\r\\n*341*']\n"
