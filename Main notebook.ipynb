They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.\", 'Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.', \"The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\", 'When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.', 'None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.', 'At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\\'s drive.', \"It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\", \"But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...\", 'yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.', \"Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\", \"He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\", '\"The Potters, that\\'s right, that\\'s what I heard yes, their son, Harry\"', 'Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.', \"He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks...\", \"He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\", '\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn\\'t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don\\'t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\"', 'And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.', \"Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination.\", \"As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\", '\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn\\'t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.', 'Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\\'s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\"Won\\'t!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: \"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\\'s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster allowed himself a grin.', '\"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\"', '\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don\\'t know about that, but it\\'s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\\'ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it\\'s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\"', 'Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...', 'Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He\\'d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven\\'t heard from your sister lately, have you?\"', \"As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.\", '\"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\"', '\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...\"', '\"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley.', '\"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd.\"', 'Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\\'d heard the name \"Potter.\" He decided he didn\\'t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son -- he\\'d be about Dudley\\'s age now, wouldn\\'t he?\"', '\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.', '\"What\\'s his name again? Howard, isn\\'t it?\"', '\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\"', '\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite agree.\"', \"He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.\", 'While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there.', 'It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.', \"Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn't think he could bear it.\", \"The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them....\", 'How very wrong he was.', \"Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\", \"A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\", 'Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.', \"His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.\", 'Albus Dumbledore didn\\'t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \"I should have known.\"', \"He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.\", '\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"', 'He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.', '\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.', '\"My dear Professor, I \\'ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"', '\"You\\'d be stiff if you\\'d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said Professor McGonagall.', '\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"', 'Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.', '\"Oh yes, everyone\\'s celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently.', '\"You\\'d think they\\'d be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something\\'s going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her head back at the Dursleys\\' dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they\\'re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I\\'ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\"', '\"You can\\'t blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We\\'ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\"', '\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that\\'s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\"', 'She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\\'t, so she went on. \"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\"', '\"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"', '\"A what?\"', '\"A lemon drop. They\\'re a kind of Muggle sweet I\\'m rather fond of\"', '\"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\\'t think this was the moment for lemon drops. \"As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -\"', '\"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this \\'You- Know-Who\\' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets so confusing if we keep saying \\'You-Know-Who.\\' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\\'s name.', '\"I know you haven \\'t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \"But you\\'re different. Everyone knows you\\'re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\"', '\"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will never have.\"', '\"Only because you\\'re too -- well -- noble to use them.\"', '\"It\\'s lucky it\\'s dark. I haven\\'t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\"', 'Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone\\'s saying? About why he\\'s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\"', 'It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.', '\"What they\\'re saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric\\'s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they\\'re -- dead. \\x93', 'Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.', '\"Lily and James... I can\\'t believe it... I didn\\'t want to believe it...', 'Oh, Albus...\"', 'Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know... I know...\" he said heavily.', 'Professor McGonagall\\'s voice trembled as she went on. \"That\\'s not all.', \"They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.\", 'Dumbledore nodded glumly.', '\"It\\'s -- it\\'s true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he\\'s done... all the people he\\'s killed... he couldn\\'t kill a little boy? It\\'s just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\"', '\"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\"', 'Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch.', 'It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid\\'s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\\'d be here, by the way?\"', '\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don\\'t suppose you\\'re going to tell me why you\\'re here, of all places?\"', '\"I\\'ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\\'re the only family he has left now.\"', '\"You don\\'t mean -- you can\\'t mean the people who live here?\" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.', '\"Dumbledore -- you can\\'t. I\\'ve been watching them all day. You couldn\\'t find two people who are less like us. And they\\'ve got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.', 'Harry Potter come and live here!\"', '\"It\\'s the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\\'s older. I\\'ve written them a letter.\"', '\"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\\'ll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn\\'t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name!\"', '\"Exactly,\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy\\'s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\\'t even remember! CarA you see how much better off he\\'ll be, growing up away from all that until he\\'s ready to take it?\"', 'Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, \"Yes -- yes, you\\'re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.', '\"Hagrid\\'s bringing him.\"', '\"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\"', 'I would trust Hagrid with my life,\" said Dumbledore.', '\"I\\'m not saying his heart isn\\'t in the right place,\" said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can\\'t pretend he\\'s not careless. He does tend to -- what was that?\"', 'A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.', 'If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.', '\"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\"', '\"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit,\" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I\\'ve got him, sir.\"', '\"No problems, were there?\"', '\"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\\' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\\' over Bristol.\"', 'Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.', '\"Is that where -?\" whispered Professor McGonagall.', '\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He\\'ll have that scar forever.\"', '\"Couldn\\'t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\"', '\"Even if I could, I wouldn\\'t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we\\'d better get this over with.\"', \"Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.\", '\"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?\" asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.', '\"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"you\\'ll wake the Muggles!\"', '\"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \"But I c-c-can\\'t stand it -- Lily an\\' James dead -- an\\' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -\"', '\"Yes, yes, it\\'s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\\'ll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\\'s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\\'s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore\\'s eyes seemed to have gone out.', '\"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that\\'s that. We\\'ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\"', '\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I\\'ll be takin\\' Sirius his bike back. G\\'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.\"', 'Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.', '\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.', 'Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.', '\"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.', 'A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\\' time by Mrs. Dursley\\'s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn\\'t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!\"', \"Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.\", 'Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.', 'The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.', 'Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.', '\"Up! Get up! Now!\"', 'Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.', '\"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\\'d had the same dream before.', 'His aunt was back outside the door.', '\"Are you up yet?\" she demanded.', '\"Nearly,\" said Harry.', '\"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\\'t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\\'s birthday.\"', 'Harry groaned.', '\"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door.', '\"Nothing, nothing...\"', \"Dudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\", \"When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast.\", \"Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\", '\"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don\\'t ask questions.\"', \"Don't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.\", 'Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.', '\"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.', 'About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way -- all over the place.', 'Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.', \"Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents.\", 'His face fell.', '\"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That\\'s two less than last year.\"', '\"Darling, you haven\\'t counted Auntie Marge\\'s present, see, it\\'s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\"', '\"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face.', 'Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.', 'Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we\\'ll buy you another two presents while we\\'re out today. How\\'s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right\\'\\' Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So I\\'ll have thirty ... thirty...\"', '\"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia.', '\"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\"', 'Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money\\'s worth, just like his father. \\'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley\\'s hair.', 'At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.', '\"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg\\'s broken her leg. She can\\'t take him.\" She jerked her head in Harry\\'s direction.', \"Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned.\", '\"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\\'d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn\\'t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.', '\"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested.', '\"Don\\'t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\"', \"The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug.\", '\"What about what\\'s-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?\"', '\"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia.', '\"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he\\'d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley\\'s computer).', \"Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon.\", '\"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled.', '\"I won\\'t blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren\\'t listening.', '\"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \"...', 'and leave him in the car....\"', '\"That car\\'s new, he\\'s not sitting in it alone....\"', \"Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\", '\"Dinky Duddydums, don\\'t cry, Mummy won\\'t let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him.', '\"I... don\\'t... want... him... t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp- spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother\\'s arms.', 'Just then, the doorbell rang -- \"Oh, good Lord, they\\'re here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley\\'s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people\\'s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.', \"Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\", '\"I\\'m warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry\\'s, \"I\\'m warning you now, boy -- any funny business, anything at all -- and you\\'ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\"', '\"I\\'m not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly..', \"But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did.\", \"The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.\", 'Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn\\'t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.', \"Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.\", \"Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished.\", \"On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump.\", \"But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room.\", 'While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.', '\"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.', 'I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.\"', 'Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON\\'T FLY!\"', 'Dudley and Piers sniggered.', 'I know they don\\'t,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\"', \"But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.\", \"It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond.\", \"Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.\", 'Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.', \"After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\", 'Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.', '\"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn\\'t budge.', '\"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.', '\"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.', \"Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\", \"The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.\", 'It winked.', \"Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\", 'The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \"I get that all the time.', '\"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\\'t sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\"', 'The snake nodded vigorously.', '\"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked.', 'The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.', 'Boa Constrictor, Brazil.', '\"Was it nice there?\"', 'The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see -- so you\\'ve never been to Brazil?\"', 'As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.', '\"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON\\'T BELIEVE WHAT IT\\'S DOING!\"', 'Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.', '\"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.', \"Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.\", 'As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.\"', 'The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.', '\"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\"', 'The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\\'t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\\'s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren\\'t you, Harry?\"', 'Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.', \"Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.\", \"He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\", 'When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.', \"At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\", 'The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.', \"Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\", \"This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\", '\"They stuff people\\'s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\"', 'he told Harry. \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\"', '\"No, thanks,\" said Harry. \"The poor toilet\\'s never had anything as horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick.\" Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he\\'d said.', \"One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn 't as bad as usual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years.\", \"That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\", \"As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\", 'There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.', '\"What\\'s this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.', '\"Your new school uniform,\" she said.', 'Harry looked in the bowl again.', '\"Oh,\" he said, \"I didn\\'t realize it had to be so wet.\"', '\"DotA be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"I\\'m dyeing some of Dudley\\'s old things gray for you. It\\'ll look just like everyone else\\'s when I\\'ve finished.\"', 'Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.', \"Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.\", 'They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.', '\"Get the mail, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.', '\"Make Harry get it.\"', '\"Get the mail, Harry.\"', '\"Make Dudley get it.\"', '\"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\"', \"Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and -- a letter for Harry.\", \"Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.\", 'Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H.', '\"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \"What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke.', 'Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.', 'Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.', '\"Marge\\'s ill,\" he informed Aunt Petunia. \"Ate a funny whelk. --.\"', '\"Dad!\" said Dudley suddenly. \"Dad, Harry\\'s got something!\"', 'Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.', '\"That\\'s mine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.', '\"Who\\'d be writing to you?\" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn\\'t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.', '\"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped.', 'Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.', '\"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!\"', \"They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\", '\"I want to read that letter,\" he said loudly. want to read it,\" said Harry furiously, \"as it\\'s mine.\"', '\"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.', \"Harry didn't move.\", 'I WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted.', '\"Let me see it!\" demanded Dudley.', '\"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.', '\"Vernon,\" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \"look at the address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don\\'t think they\\'re watching the house?\"', '\"Watching -- spying -- might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.', '\"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don\\'t want --\"', \"Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.\", '\"No,\" he said finally. \"No, we\\'ll ignore it. If they don\\'t get an answer... Yes, that\\'s best... we won\\'t do anything....', '\"But --\"', '\"I\\'m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\\'t we swear when we took him in we\\'d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\"', \"That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\", '\"Where\\'s my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \"Who\\'s writing to me?\"', '\"No one. it was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon shortly.', '\"I have burned it.\"', '\"It was not a mistake,\" said Harry angrily, \"it had my cupboard on it.\"', '\"SILENCE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.', '\"Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking... you\\'re really getting a bit big for it... we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley\\'s second bedroom.', '\"Why?\" said Harry.', '\"Don\\'t ask questions!\" snapped his uncle. \"Take this stuff upstairs, now.\"', \"The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched.\", 'From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don\\'t want him in there... I need that room... make him get out....\"', \"Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.\", \"Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\", 'When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \"There\\'s another one! \\'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --\\'\\x93', \"With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand.\", '\"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry.', '\"Dudley -- go -- just go.\"', \"Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure they didn't fail. He had a plan.\", \"The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\", \"He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door -- Harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat -- something alive! Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.\", 'Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.', 'I want --\" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.', '\"See,\" he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \"if they can\\'t deliver them they\\'ll just give up.\"', '\"I\\'m not sure that\\'ll work, Vernon.\"', '\"Oh, these people\\'s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they\\'re not like you and me,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.', \"On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.\", 'Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\"', 'as he worked, and jumped at small noises.', 'On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.', '\"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\" Dudley asked Harry in amazement.', 'On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.', '\"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \"no damn letters today --\"', 'Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one.', '\"Out! OUT!\"', 'Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.', 'When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.', '\"That does it,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We\\'re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\"', 'He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway.', 'Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.', 'They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\\'t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. \"Shake\\'em off... shake \\'em off,\" he would mutter whenever he did this.', \"They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\", 'Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering....', 'They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.', '\"\\'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an \\'undred of these at the front desk.\"', 'She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: Mr. H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.', '\"I\\'ll take them,\" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.', 'Wouldn\\'t it be better just to go home, dear?\" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn\\'t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.', '\"Daddy\\'s gone mad, hasn\\'t he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.', 'It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley sniveled.', '\"It\\'s Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto\\'s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television. \\x93', \"Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.\", \"Still, you weren't eleven every day.\", \"Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd bought.\", '\"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\"', 'It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.', '\"Storm forecast for tonight!\" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \"And this gentleman\\'s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\"', 'A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.', '\"I\\'ve already got us some rations,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"so all aboard!\"', 'It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.', 'The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.', \"Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.\", '\"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?\" he said cheerfully.', \"He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.\", 'As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.', \"The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\", \"Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did.\", \"Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow.\", \"Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty ... ten...\", \"nine -- maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three... two...\", 'one...', 'BOOM.', 'The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.', 'BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \"Where\\'s the cannon?\" he said stupidly.', 'There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.', '\"Who\\'s there?\" he shouted. \"I warn you -- I\\'m armed!\"', 'There was a pause. Then \\x96', 'SMASH!', 'The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.', 'A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.', 'The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.', '\"Couldn\\'t make us a cup o\\' tea, could yeh? It\\'s not been an easy journey...\"', 'He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.', '\"Budge up, yeh great lump,\" said the stranger.', 'Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.', '\"An\\' here\\'s Harry!\" said the giant.', 'Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.', '\"Las\\' time I saw you, you was only a baby,\" said the giant. \"Yeh look a lot like yet dad, but yeh\\'ve got yet mom\\'s eyes.\"', 'Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.', 'I demand that you leave at once, sit!\" he said. \"You are breaking and entering!\"', '\"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\\'s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.', 'Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.', '\"Anyway -- Harry,\" said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \"a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat on it at some point, but it\\'ll taste all right.\"', 'From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.', 'Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \"Who are you?\"', 'The giant chuckled.', '\"True, I haven\\'t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\"', \"He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm.\", '\"What about that tea then, eh?\" he said, rubbing his hands together.', '\"I\\'d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh\\'ve got it, mind.\"', \"His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath.\", 'The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \"Don\\'t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\"', 'The giant chuckled darkly.', '\"Yet great puddin\\' of a son don\\' need fattenin\\' anymore, Dursley, don\\' worry.\"', 'He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\\'t take his eyes off the giant.

Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help trusting him.\", '\"This is it,\" said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \"the Leaky Cauldron.

Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\"', '\"Can\\'t, Tom, I\\'m on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry\\'s shoulder and making Harry\\'s knees buckle.', '\"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this -- can this be --?\"', 'The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.', '\"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter... what an honor.\"', 'He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.', '\"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\"', \"Harry didn't know what to say.

Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin\\' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he\\'s usually tremblin\\'.\"', '\"Is he always that nervous?\"', '\"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin\\' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience.... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o\\' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since.', 'Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where\\'s me umbrella?\"', \"Vampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\", '\"Three up... two across he muttered. \"Right, stand back, Harry.\"', 'He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.', 'The brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a small hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.', '\"Welcome,\" said Hagrid, \"to Diagon Alley.\"', \"He grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.\", 'The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.', 'Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring -- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.', '\"Yeah, you\\'ll be needin\\' one,\" said Hagrid, \"but we gotta get yer money first.\"', 'Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \"Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they\\'re mad....\"', 'A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry\\'s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new Nimbus Two Thousand -- fastest ever --\" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels\\' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon....', '\"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid.', 'They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was - \"Yeah, that\\'s a goblin,\" said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.', 'He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn.', 'So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there.', '\"Like I said, Yeh\\'d be mad ter try an\\' rob it,\" said Hagrid.', 'A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.', 'There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.', '\"Morning,\" said Hagrid to a free goblin. \"We\\'ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter\\'s safe.\"', '\"You have his key, Sir?\"', '\"Got it here somewhere,\" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin\\'s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.', '\"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.', 'The goblin looked at it closely.', '\"That seems to be in order.\"', '\"An\\' I\\'ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \"It\\'s about the YouKnow-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\"', 'The goblin read the letter carefully.', '\"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have Someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\"', 'Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.', '\"What\\'s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\" Harry asked.', '\"Can\\'t tell yeh that,\" said Hagrid mysteriously. \"Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore\\'s trusted me. More\\'n my job\\'s worth ter tell yeh that.\"', 'Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some difficulty -- and were off.', \"At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering.\", \"Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.\", 'I never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \"what\\'s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\"', '\"Stalagmite\\'s got an \\'m\\' in it,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\' don\\' ask me questions just now, I think I\\'m gonna be sick.\"', 'He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.', 'Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.', '\"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid.', \"All Harry's -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\", 'Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.', '\"The gold ones are Galleons,\" he explained. \"Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\\'s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o\\' terms, we\\'ll keep the rest safe for yeh.\" He turned to Griphook. \"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\"', '\"One speed only,\" said Griphook.', 'They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.', 'Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.', '\"Stand back,\" said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.', '\"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\\'d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\" said Griphook.', '\"How often do you check to see if anyone\\'s inside?\" Harry asked.', '\"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.', 'Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.', '\"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don\\'t talk to me on the way back, it\\'s best if I keep me mouth shut,\" said Hagrid.', \"One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole life -- more money than even Dudley had ever had.\", '\"Might as well get yer uniform,\" said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin\\'s Robes for All Occasions. \"Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\" He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin\\'s shop alone, feeling nervous.', 'Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.', '\"Hogwarts, clear?\" she said, when Harry started to speak. \"Got the lot here -- another young man being fitted up just now, in fact. \\x93', 'In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes.

He had a bored, drawling voice. \"Then I\\'m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don\\'t see why first years can\\'t have their own. I think I\\'ll bully father into getting me one and I\\'ll smuggle it in somehow.\"', 'Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.', '\"Have you got your own broom?\" the boy went on.', '\"No,\" said Harry.', '\"Play Quidditch at all?\"', '\"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.', '\"I do -- Father says it\\'s a crime if I\\'m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\\'ll be in yet?\"', '\"No,\" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.', '\"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I\\'ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\\'d leave, wouldn\\'t you?\" \"Mmm,\" said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.', '\"I say, look at that man!\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\\'t come in.', '\"That\\'s Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn\\'t.', '\"He works at Hogwarts.\"', '\"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I\\'ve heard of him. He\\'s a sort of servant, isn\\'t he?\"', '\"He\\'s the gamekeeper,\" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.', '\"Yes, exactly. I heard he\\'s a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.\"', '\"I think he\\'s brilliant,\" said Harry coldly.', '\"Do you?\" said the boy, with a slight sneer. \"Why is he with you? Where are your parents?\"', '\"They\\'re dead,\" said Harry shortly. He didn\\'t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.', '\"Oh, sorry,\" said the other,. not sounding sorry at all. \"But they were our kind, weren\\'t they?\"', '\"They were a witch and wizard, if that\\'s what you mean.\"', '\"I really don\\'t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They\\'re just not the same, they\\'ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families.', 'What\\'s your surname, anyway?\"', 'But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \"That\\'s you done, my dear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.', '\"Well, I\\'ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\" said the drawling boy.', 'Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).', '\"What\\'s up?\" said Hagrid.', '\"Nothing,\" Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \"Hagrid, what\\'s Quidditch?\"', '\"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\\' how little yeh know -- not knowin\\' about Quidditch!\"', '\"Don\\'t make me feel worse,\" said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin\\'s.', '\"--and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\\'t even be allowed in.\"', '\"Yer not from a Muggle family.

There\\'s four.

Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.\", '\"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\"', '\"I\\'m not sayin\\' that\\'s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\' anyway, yeh couldn\\' work any of them curses yet, yeh\\'ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\"', 'Hagrid wouldn\\'t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\"It says pewter on yer list\"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).', \"Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again.\", '\"Just yer wand left - A yeah, an\\' I still haven\\'t got yeh a birthday present.\"', 'Harry felt himself go red.', '\"You don\\'t have to --\"', '\"I know I don\\'t have to.

All the kids want owls, they\\'re dead useful, carry yer mail an\\' everythin\\'.\"', \"Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.\", '\"Don\\' mention it,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"Don\\' expect you\\'ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\"', 'A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.', 'The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.', 'A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.', '\"Good afternoon,\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.', 'An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.', '\"Hello,\" said Harry awkwardly.', '\"Ah yes,\" said the man. \"Yes, yes. I thought I\\'d be seeing you soon.', 'Harry Potter.\" It wasn\\'t a question. \"You have your mother\\'s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\"', 'Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.', '\"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches.', 'Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it -- it\\'s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\"', 'Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.', '\"And that\\'s where...\"', \"Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a long, white finger.\", '\"I\\'m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\" he said softly.', '\"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands... well, if I\\'d known what that wand was going out into the world to do....\"', \"He shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid.\", '\"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\\'t it?\"', '\"It was, sir, yes,\" said Hagrid.', '\"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.', '\"Er -- yes, they did, yes,\" said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \"I\\'ve still got the pieces, though,\" he added brightly.', '\"But you don\\'t use them?\" said Mr. Ollivander sharply.', '\"Oh, no, sit,\" said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.', '\"Hmmm,\" said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \"Well, now -- Mr. Potter. Let me see.\" He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. \"Which is your wand arm?\"', '\"Er -- well, I\\'m right-handed,\" said Harry.', '\"Hold out your arm. That\\'s it.\" He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \"Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard\\'s wand.\"', 'Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.', '\"That will do,\" he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. \"Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.\"', 'Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.', '\"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try --\"', 'Harry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.', '\"No, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.', 'Go on, go on, try it out.\"', 'Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.', '\"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\\'ll find the perfect match here somewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination -- holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\"', 'Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \"Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... \\x93', 'He put Harry\\'s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \"Curious... curious..', '\"Sorry,\" said Harry, \"but what\\'s curious?\"', 'Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.', '\"I remember every wand I\\'ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that scar.\"', 'Harry swallowed.', '\"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter.... After all, He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great.\"', \"Harry shivered. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.\", \"The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn't speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry's lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.\", '\"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\" he said.', 'He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.', '\"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\" said Hagrid.', \"Harry wasn't sure he could explain. He'd just had the best birthday of his life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.\", '\"Everyone thinks I\\'m special,\" he said at last. \"All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don\\'t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I\\'m famous and I can\\'t even remember what I\\'m famous for. I don\\'t know what happened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died.\"', 'Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.', '\"Don\\' you worry, Harry. You\\'ll learn fast enough.

But yeh\\'ll have a great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, \\'smatter of fact.\"', 'Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.', '\"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, \" he said. \"First o\\' September -- King\\'s Cross -- it\\'s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she\\'ll know where to find me.... See yeh soon, Harry.\"', 'The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.', \"Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all.\", 'Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.', \"Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.\", \"On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television.

Harry supposed that meant yes.', '\"Thank you.\"', 'He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.', '\"Funny way to get to a wizards\\' school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?\"', \"Harry didn't say anything.\", '\"Where is this school, anyway?\"', '\"I don\\'t know,\" said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.', '\"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o\\'clock,\" he read.', 'His aunt and uncle stared.', '\"Platform what?\"', '\"Nine and three-quarters.\"', '\"Don\\'t talk rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"There is no platform nine and three-quarters.\"', '\"It\\'s on my ticket.\"', '\"Barking,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"howling mad, the lot of them. You\\'ll see.', 'You just wait. All right, we\\'ll take you to King\\'s Cross. We\\'re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\\'t bother.\"', '\"Why are you going to London?\" Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.', '\"Taking Dudley to the hospital,\" growled Uncle Vernon. \"Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\"', \"Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes -- he'd change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.\", \"They reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.\", '\"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don\\'t seem to have built it yet, do they?\"', 'He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.', '\"Have a good term,\" said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away.', \"All three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He'd have to ask someone.\", \"He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but the guard said there wasn't one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic.\", 'According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.', \"Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten.\", 'At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.', '\"-- packed with Muggles, of course --\"', \"Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him -- and they had an owl.\", 'Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.', '\"Now, what\\'s the platform number?\" said the boys\\' mother.', '\"Nine and three-quarters!\" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, \"Mom, can\\'t I go... \\x93', '\"You\\'re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.\"', 'What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.', 'Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.', '\"Fred, you next,\" the plump woman said.', '\"I\\'m not Fred, I\\'m George,\" said the boy. \"Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? CarA you tell I\\'m George?\"', '\"Sorry, George, dear.\"', '\"Only joking, I am Fred,\" said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone -- but how had he done it? Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn\\'t anywhere.', 'There was nothing else for it.', '\"Excuse me,\" Harry said to the plump woman.', '\"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"First time at Hogwarts? Ron\\'s new, too.\"', 'She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.', '\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"The thing is -- the thing is, I don\\'t know how to --\"', '\"How to get onto the platform?\" she said kindly, and Harry nodded.', '\"Not to worry,\" she said. \"All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don\\'t stop and don\\'t be scared you\\'ll crash into it, that\\'s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you\\'re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\"', '\"Er -- okay,\" said Harry.', 'He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid.', \"He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer and nearer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- the cart was out of control -- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash -- It didn't come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O'clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.\", 'Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.', 'The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats.', 'Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat.', 'He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \"Gran, I\\'ve lost my toad again.\"', '\"Oh, Neville,\" he heard the old woman sigh.', 'A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.', '\"Give us a look, Lee, go on.\"', 'The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.', 'Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.', '\"Want a hand?\" It was one of the red-haired twins he\\'d followed through the barrier.', '\"Yes, please,\" Harry panted.', '\"Oy, Fred! C\\'mere and help!\"', \"With the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.\", '\"Thanks,\" said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.', '\"What\\'s that?\" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry\\'s lightning scar.', '\"Blimey,\" said the other twin. \"Are you \"He is,\" said the first twin. \"Aren\\'t you?\" he added to Harry.', '\"What?\" said Harry.', '\"Harry Potter, \"chorused the twins.', '\"Oh, him,\" said Harry. \"I mean, yes, I am.\"', \"The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door.\", '\"Fred? George? Are you there?\"', '\"Coming, Mom.\"', 'With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.', 'Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.', '\"Ron, you\\'ve got something on your nose.\"', 'The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.', '\"Mom -- geroff\" He wriggled free.', '\"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\" said one of the twins.', '\"Shut up,\" said Ron.', '\"Where\\'s Percy?\" said their mother.', '\"He\\'s coming now.\"', 'The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it.', '\"Can\\'t stay long, Mother,\" he said. \"I\\'m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves --\"', '\"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?\" said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. \"You should have said something, we had no idea.\"', '\"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\" said the other twin. \"Once --\"', '\"Or twice --\"', '\"A minute --\"', '\"All summer --\"', '\"Oh, shut up,\" said Percy the Prefect.', '\"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\" said one of the twins.', '\"Because he\\'s a prefect,\" said their mother fondly. \"All right, dear, well, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there.\"', 'She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.', '\"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you\\'ve -- you\\'ve blown up a toilet or --\"', '\"Blown up a toilet? We\\'ve never blown up a toilet.\"', '\"Great idea though, thanks, Mom.\"', '\"It\\'s not funny. And look after Ron.\"', '\"Don\\'t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\"', '\"Shut up,\" said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.', '\"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\"', \"Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking.\", '\"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?\"', '\"Who?\"', '\"Harry Potter!\"', \"Harry heard the little girl's voice.\", '\"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please....\"', '\"You\\'ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn\\'t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\"', '\"Asked him. Saw his scar. It\\'s really there - like lightning.\"', '\"Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.\"', '\"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?\"', 'Their mother suddenly became very stern.', '\"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\\'t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.\"', '\"All right, keep your hair on.\"', 'A whistle sounded.', '\"Hurry up!\" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry.', '\"Don\\'t, Ginny, we\\'ll send you loads of owls.\"', '\"We\\'ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\"', '\"George!\"', '\"Only joking, Mom.\"', \"The train began to move. Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\", \"Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.\", 'The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.', '\"Anyone sitting there?\" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry.', '\"Everywhere else is full.\"', \"Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.\", '\"Hey, Ron.\"', 'The twins were back.', '\"Listen, we\\'re going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan\\'s got a giant tarantula down there.\"', '\"Right,\" mumbled Ron.', '\"Harry,\" said the other twin, \"did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.', '\"Bye,\" said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.', '\"Are you really Harry Potter?\" Ron blurted out.', 'Harry nodded.', '\"Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George\\'s jokes,\" said Ron. \"And have you really got -- you know...\"', \"He pointed at Harry's forehead.\", 'Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar.

He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.', '\"Are all your family wizards?\" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.', '\"Er -- Yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom\\'s got a second cousin who\\'s an accountant, but we never talk about him.\"', '\"So you must know loads of magic already.\"', 'The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.', '\"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they like?\"', '\"Horrible -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I\\'d had three wizard brothers.\"', '\"Five,\" said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \"I\\'m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I\\'ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy\\'s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they\\'re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it\\'s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I\\'ve got Bill\\'s old robes, Charlie\\'s old wand, and Percy\\'s old rat.\"', 'Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.', '\"His name\\'s Scabbers and he\\'s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn\\'t aff -- I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\"', \"Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.\", \"Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.\", '\"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn\\'t know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort\"', 'Ron gasped.', '\"What?\" said Harry.', '\"You said You-Know-Who\\'s name!\" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \"I\\'d have thought you, of all people --\"', '\"I\\'m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said Harry, I just never knew you shouldn\\'t. See what I mean? I\\'ve got loads to learn.... I bet,\" he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, \"I bet I\\'m the worst in the class.\"', '\"You won\\'t be. There\\'s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.\"', 'While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.', 'Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.', 'Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \"Anything off the cart, dears?\"', \"Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor.\", \"He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.\", 'Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.', '\"Hungry, are you?\"', '\"Starving,\" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.', 'Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside.

It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry\\'s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).', '\"What are these?\" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.', '\"They\\'re not really frogs, are they?\" He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.', '\"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is. I\\'m missing Agrippa.\"', '\"What?\"', '\"Oh, of course, you wouldn\\'t know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I\\'ve got about five hundred, but I haven\\'t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\"', \"Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man's face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.\", '\"So this is Dumbledore!\" said Harry.', '\"Don\\'t tell me you\\'d never heard of Dumbledore!\" said Ron. \"Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks Harry turned over his card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\\'s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.', \"Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore's face had disappeared.\", '\"He\\'s gone!\"', '\"Well, you can\\'t expect him to hang around all day,\" said Ron. \"He\\'ll be back. No, I\\'ve got Morgana again and I\\'ve got about six of her... do you want it? You can start collecting.\"', \"Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.\", '\"Help yourself,\" said Harry. \"But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.\"', '\"Do they? What, they don\\'t move at all?\" Ron sounded amazed. \"weird!\"', \"Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.\", \"He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.\", '\"You want to be careful with those,\" Ron warned Harry. \"When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a boogerflavored one once.\"', 'Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.', '\"Bleaaargh -- see? Sprouts.\"', \"They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper.\", 'The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.', 'There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He looked tearful.', '\"Sorry,\" he said, \"but have you seen a toad at all?\"', 'When they shook their heads, he wailed, \"I\\'ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!\"', '\"He\\'ll turn up,\" said Harry.', '\"Yes,\" said the boy miserably. \"Well, if you see him...\"', 'He left.', '\"Don\\'t know why he\\'s so bothered,\" said Ron. \"If I\\'d brought a toad I\\'d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can\\'t talk.\"', \"The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap.\", '\"He might have died and you wouldn\\'t know the difference,\" said Ron in disgust. \"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn\\'t work. I\\'ll show you, look...\"', 'He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.', '\"Unicorn hair\\'s nearly poking out. Anyway He had just raised his \\'wand when the compartment door slid open again.', 'The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.', '\"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville\\'s lost one,\" she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.', '\"We\\'ve already told him we haven\\'t seen it,\" said Ron, but the girl wasn\\'t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.', '\"Oh, are you doing magic? Let\\'s see it, then.\"', 'She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.', '\"Er -- all right.\"', 'He cleared his throat.', '\"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\"', 'He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.', '\"Are you sure that\\'s a real spell?\" said the girl. \"Well, it\\'s not very good, is it? I\\'ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\\'s all worked for me. Nobody in my family\\'s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it\\'s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I\\'ve heard -- I\\'ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough -- I\\'m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you.', 'She said all this very fast.', \"Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all the course books by heart either.\", '\"I\\'m Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered.', '\"Harry Potter,\" said Harry.', '\"Are you really?\" said Hermione. \"I know all about you, of course -- I got a few extra books. for background reading, and you\\'re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.', '\"Am I?\" said Harry, feeling dazed.', '\"Goodness, didn\\'t you know, I\\'d have found out everything I could if it was me,\" said Hermione. \"Do either of you know what house you\\'ll be in? I\\'ve been asking around, and I hope I\\'m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn\\'t be too bad.... Anyway, we\\'d better go and look for Neville\\'s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we\\'ll be there soon.\"', 'And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.', '\"Whatever house I\\'m in, I hope she\\'s not in it,\" said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. \"Stupid spell -- George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.\"', '\"What house are your brothers in?\" asked Harry.', '\"Gryffindor,\" said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \"Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don\\'t know what they\\'ll say if I\\'m not. I don\\'t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\"', '\"That\\'s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\"', '\"Yeah,\" said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.', '\"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers\\' whiskers are a bit lighter,\"', 'said Harry, trying to take Ron\\'s mind off houses. \"So what do your oldest brothers do now that they\\'ve left, anyway?\"', \"Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school.\", '\"Charlie\\'s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill\\'s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\" said Ron. \"Did you hear about Gringotts? It\\'s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don\\'t suppose you get that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security vault.\"', 'Harry stared.', '\"Really? What happened to them?\"', '\"Nothing, that\\'s why it\\'s such big news. They haven\\'t been caught. My dad says it must\\'ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don\\'t think they took anything, that\\'s what\\'s odd. \\'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who\\'s behind it.\"', 'Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \"Voldemort\" without worrying.', '\"What\\'s your Quidditch team?\" Ron asked.', '\"Er -- I don\\'t know any,\" Harry confessed.', '\"What!\" Ron looked dumbfounded. \"Oh, you wait, it\\'s the best game in the world --\" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he\\'d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he\\'d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn\\'t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.', \"Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley.\", '\"Is it true?\" he said. \"They\\'re saying all down the train that Harry Potter\\'s in this compartment. So it\\'s you, is it?\"', '\"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.', '\"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \"And my name\\'s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\"', 'Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco Malfoy looked at him.', '\"Think my name\\'s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.\"', 'He turned back to Harry. \"You\\'ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don\\'t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\"', \"He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.\", '\"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\" he said coolly.', \"Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.\", '\"I\\'d be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly. \"Unless you\\'re a bit politer you\\'ll go the same way as your parents. They didn\\'t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it\\'ll rub off on you.\"', 'Both Harry and Ron stood up.', '\"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair.', '\"Oh, you\\'re going to fight us, are you?\" Malfoy sneered.', '\"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.', '\"But we don\\'t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We\\'ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\"', \"Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\", \"Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle's knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\", '\"What has been going on?\" she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.', 'I think he\\'s been knocked out,\" Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. \"No -- I don\\'t believe it -- he\\'s gone back to sleep-\"', 'And so he had.', '\"You\\'ve met Malfoy before?\"', 'Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.', '\"I\\'ve heard of his family,\" said Ron darkly. \"They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they\\'d been bewitched. My dad doesn\\'t believe it. He says Malfoy\\'s father didn\\'t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\" He turned to Hermione. \"Can we help you with something?\"', '\"You\\'d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\\'ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we\\'re nearly there. You haven\\'t been fighting, have you? You\\'ll be in trouble before we even get there!\"', '\"Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\" said Ron, scowling at her. \"Would you mind leaving while we change?\"', '\"All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\" said Hermione in a sniffy voice. \"And you\\'ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\"', 'Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.', 'He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.', \"Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.\", 'A voice echoed through the train: \"We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes\\' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.\"', \"Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.\", 'The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \"Firs\\' years! Firs\\' years over here! All right there, Harry?\"', \"Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\", '\"C\\'mon, follow me -- any more firs\\' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs\\' years follow me!\"', 'Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.', '\"Ye\\' all get yer firs\\' sight o\\' Hogwarts in a sec,\" Hagrid called over his shoulder, \"jus\\' round this bend here.\"', 'There was a loud \"Oooooh!\"', 'The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take.', 'Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.', '\"No more\\'n four to a boat!\" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. \"Everyone in?\" shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. \"Right then -- FORWARD!\"', 'And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.', '\"Heads down!\" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.', '\"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\" said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.', '\"Trevor!\" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid\\'s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.', 'They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak front door.', '\"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?\"', 'Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.', \"The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross.\", '\"The firs\\' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid.', '\"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\"', \"She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.\", 'They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.', '\"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.', '\"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.', '\"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\"', \"Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.\", '\"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor McGonagall.', '\"Please wait quietly.\"', 'She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.', '\"How exactly do they sort us into houses?\" he asked Ron.', '\"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\"', \"Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived.\", \"He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.\", 'Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air -- several people behind him screamed.', '\"What the --?\"', 'He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance --\"', '\"My dear Friar, haven\\'t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he\\'s not really even a ghost -- I say, what are you all doing here?\"', 'A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.', 'Nobody answered.', '\"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\"', 'A few people nodded mutely.', '\"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old house, you know.\"', '\"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony\\'s about to start.\"', 'Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.', '\"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\"', 'Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.', 'Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.', 'These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.', 'Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.', 'The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, \"Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\"', \"It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.\", \"Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house.\", 'Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing: \"Oh, you may not think I\\'m pretty, But don\\'t judge on what you see, I\\'ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me.', \"You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all.\", \"There's nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can't see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be.\", \"You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you've a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You'll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends.\", 'So put me on! Don\\'t be afraid! And don\\'t get in a flap! You\\'re in safe hands (though I have none) For I\\'m a Thinking Cap!\"', 'The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.', '\"So we\\'ve just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I\\'ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\"', \"Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather alot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\", 'Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.', '\"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\"', 'A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause -- \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat.', 'The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.', '\"Bones, Susan!\"', '\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.', '\"Boot, Terry!\"', '\"RAVENCLAW!\"', 'The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.', '\" Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\"', \"became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.\", '\"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry\\'s imagination, after all he\\'d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.', 'He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.', '\"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\"', '\"HUFFLEPUFF!\"', 'Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.', '\"Granger, Hermione!\"', 'Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.', '\"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat. Ron groaned.', 'A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you\\'re very nervous. What if he wasn\\'t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he\\'d better get back on the train? When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \"MacDougal, Morag.\"', 'Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \"SLYTHERIN!\"', 'Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.', 'There weren\\'t many people left now. \"Moon\" \"Nott\" \"Parkinson\" then a pair of twin girls, \"Patil\" and \"Patil\" then \"Perks, Sally-Anne\" and then, at last -- \"Potter, Harry!\"', 'As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.', '\"Potter, did she say?\"', 'The Harry Potter?\"', 'The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.', 'Hmm,\" said a small voice in his ear. \"Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There\\'s talent, A my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\\'s interesting....', 'So where shall I put you?\"', 'Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.', '\"Not Slytherin, eh?\" said the small voice. \"Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it\\'s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you\\'re sure -- better be GRYFFINDOR!\"', 'Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \"We got Potter! We got Potter!\" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he\\'d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he\\'d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.', \"He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.\", 'And now there were only three people left to be sorted. \"Thomas, Dean,\"', 'a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.', '\"Turpin, Lisa,\" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\\'s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR!\"', 'Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.', '\"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry as \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.', 'Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.', 'Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.', '\"Welcome,\" he said. \"Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! \"Thank you!\"', \"He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not.\", '\"Is he -- a bit mad?\" he asked Percy uncertainly.', '\"Mad?\" said Percy airily. \"He\\'s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\"', \"Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.\", \"The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.\", 'It was all delicious.', '\"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak, \"Can\\'t you --?\"', 'I haven\\'t eaten for nearly four hundred years,\" said the ghost. \"I don\\'t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don\\'t think I\\'ve in troduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\"', '\"I know who you are!\" said Ron suddenly. \"My brothers told me about you -- you\\'re Nearly Headless Nick!\"', '\"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy --\" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.', '\"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\"', \"Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted.\", '\"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you\\'re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron\\'s becoming almost unbearable -- he\\'s the Slytherin ghost.\"', \"Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\", '\"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest.', '\"I\\'ve never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.', 'When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- \\x93', 'As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.', '\"I\\'m half-and-half,\" said Seamus. \"Me dad\\'s a Muggle. Mom didn\\'t tell him she was a witch \\'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\"', 'The others laughed.', '\"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron.', '\"Well, my gran brought me up and she\\'s a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\"', 'On Harry\\'s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there\\'s so much to learn, I\\'m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it\\'s supposed to be very difficult-\"; \"You\\'ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- \").', 'Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.', 'Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.', \"It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead.\", '\"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head.', '\"What is it?\" asked Percy.', '\"N-nothing.\"', \"The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all.\", '\"Who\\'s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy.', '\"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\\'s looking so nervous, that\\'s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn\\'t want to -- everyone knows he\\'s after Quirrell\\'s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\"', \"Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.\", 'At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.', '\"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.', '\"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\"', \"Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.\", '\"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.', '\"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.', '\"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\"', 'Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.', '\"He\\'s not serious?\" he muttered to Percy.', '\"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It\\'s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we\\'re not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest\\'s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\"', '\"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers\\' smiles had become rather fixed.', 'Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.', '\"Everyone pick their favorite tune,\" said Dumbledore, \"and off we go!\"', 'And the school bellowed: \"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they\\'re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we\\'ve forgot, just do your best, we\\'ll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.', 'Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.', 'Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.', '\"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\"', \"The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\", 'A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.', '\"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He raised his voice, \"Peeves -- show yourself\"', 'A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.', '\"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\"', 'There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.', '\"Oooooooh!\" he said, with an evil cackle. \"Ickle Firsties! What fun!\"', 'He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.', '\"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron\\'ll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked Percy.', \"Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\", '\"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again.', '\"The Bloody Baron\\'s the only one who can control him, he won\\'t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\"', 'At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.', '\"Password?\" she said. \"Caput Draconis,\" said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.', 'Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.', '\" Great food, isn\\'t it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.', '\"Get off, Scabbers! He\\'s chewing my sheets.\"', \"Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\", \"Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\", \"He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all.\", 'There, look.\"', '\"Where?\"', '\"Next to the tall kid with the red hair.\"', '\"Wearing the glasses?\"', '\"Did you see his face?\"', '\"Did you see his scar?\"', 'Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.', \"Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\", \"There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\", 'The ghosts didn\\'t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \"GOT YOUR CONK!\"', \"Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.\", \"Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\", 'And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.', 'They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.', 'Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.', \"Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.\", \"Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.\", '\"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\" she said. \"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\"', \"Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.\", 'After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.', \"The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story.\", 'For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.', \"Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.\", 'Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.', '\"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.', '\"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron. \"Snape\\'s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we\\'ll be able to see if it\\'s true.\"', '\"Wish McGonagall favored us, \" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn\\'t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.', 'Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.', \"Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.\", \"Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\", 'It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.', \"At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him.\", 'Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.', \"Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.\", '\"Ah, Yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity.\"', \"Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth.\", 'They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.', '\"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\\'t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren\\'t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\"', \"More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.\", '\"Potter!\" said Snape suddenly. \"What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\"', \"Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air.\", '\"I don\\'t know, sit,\" said Harry.', \"Snape's lips curled into a sneer.\", '\"Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn\\'t everything.\"', \"He ignored Hermione's hand.\", '\"Let\\'s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\"', \"Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.\", '\"I don\\'t know, sit.\" \"Thought you wouldn\\'t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys\\', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? Snape was still ignoring Hermione\\'s quivering hand.', '\"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\"', 'At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.', '\"I don\\'t know,\" said Harry quietly. \"I think Hermione does, though, why don\\'t you try her?\"', \"A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked.\", 'Snape, however, was not pleased.', '\"Sit down,\" he snapped at Hermione. \"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren\\'t you all copying that down?\"', 'There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\"', \"Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.\", '\"Idiot boy!\" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. \"I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\"', 'Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.', '\"Take him up to the hospital wing,\" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.', '\"You -- Potter -- why didn\\'t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he\\'d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That\\'s another point you\\'ve lost for Gryffindor.\"', 'This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.', '\"Doi* push it,\" he muttered, \"I\\'ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.\"', 'As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\\'s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He\\'d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? \"Cheer up,\"', 'said Ron, \"Snape\\'s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\"', 'At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.', 'When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid\\'s voice rang out, saying, \"Back, Fang -- back.\"', \"Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.\", '\"Hang on,\" he said. \"Back, Fang.\"', 'He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.', 'There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.', '\"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.', '\"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.', '\"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\\'s freckles. I spent half me life chasin\\' yer twin brothers away from the forest.\"', \"The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes.\", 'Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch \"that old git.\"', '\"An\\' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I\\'d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D\\'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can\\'t get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it.\"', \"Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\", '\"But he seemed to really hate me.\"', '\"Rubbish!\" said Hagrid. \"Why should he?\"', \"Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that.\", '\"How\\'s yer brother Charlie?\" Hagrid asked Ron. \"I liked him a lot -- great with animals.\"', \"Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet: GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\", 'Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.', '\"But we\\'re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what\\'s good for you,\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.', \"Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.\", '\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might\\'ve been happening while we were there!\"', \"Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan.\", 'Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.', '\"Typical,\" said Harry darkly. \"Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\"', 'He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.', '\"You don\\'t know that you\\'ll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron reasonably. \"Anyway, I know Malfoy\\'s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that\\'s all talk.\"', \"Malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom.\", \"Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.\", \"Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.\", \"Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book -- not that she hadn't tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.\", \"Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.\", 'A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.', '\"It\\'s a Remembrall!\" he explained. \"Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there\\'s something you\\'ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh...\" His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \"You\\'ve forgotten something...\"', \"Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.\", 'Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.', '\"What\\'s going on?\"', '\"Malfoy\\'s got my Remembrall, Professor.\"', 'Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.', '\"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.', 'At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.', 'The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.', 'Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.', '\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\"', 'Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.', '\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the front, \"and say \\'Up!\"\\' \"UPF everyone shouted.', \"Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\", 'Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.', \"Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years.\", '\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three -- two --\"', \"But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips.\", '\"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and -- WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.', 'Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.', '\"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy -- it\\'s all right, up you get.\".', 'She turned to the rest of the class.', '\"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you\\'ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say \\'Quidditch.\\' Come on, dear.\"', 'Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.', 'No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.', '\"Did you see his face, the great lump?\"', 'The other Slytherins joined in.', '\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil.', '\"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. \"Never thought you\\'d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\"', '\"Look!\" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. \"It\\'s that stupid thing Longbottom\\'s gran sent him.\"', 'The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.', '\"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.', 'Malfoy smiled nastily.', '\"I think I\\'ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree?\"', '\"Give it here!\" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn\\'t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \"Come and get it, Potter!\"', 'Harry grabbed his broom.', '\"No!\" shouted Hermione Granger. \"Madam Hooch told us not to move -- you\\'ll get us all into trouble.\"', \"Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\", 'He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.', '\"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or I\\'ll knock you off that broom!\" \"Oh, yeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.', 'Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.', '\"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called.', 'The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.', '\"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.', 'Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.', '\"HARRY POTTER!\"', \"His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\", '\"Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --\"', 'Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \"-- how dare you -- might have broken your neck --\"', '\"It wasn\\'t his fault, Professor --\"', '\"Be quiet, Miss Patil \"But Malfoy --\"', '\"That\\'s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\"', \"Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag.\", 'Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.', '\"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\"', 'Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him? But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwicles class looking confused.', '\"Follow me, you two,\" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.', '\"In here.\"', 'Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.', '\"Out, Peeves!\" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.', '\"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I\\'ve found you a Seeker.\"', \"Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\", '\"Are you serious, Professor?\"', '\"Absolutely,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"The boy\\'s a natural.', 'I\\'ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\"', \"Harry nodded silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.\", '\"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\" Professor McGonagall told Wood. \"Didn\\'t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn\\'t have done it.\"', 'Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.', '\"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\" he asked excitedly.', '\"Wood\\'s captain of the Gryffindor team,\" Professor McGonagall explained.', '\"He\\'s just the build for a Seeker, too,\" said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. \"Light -- speedy -- we\\'ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I\\'d say.\"', \"I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year.\", 'Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn\\'t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks....\"', 'Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.', '\"I want to hear you\\'re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.\"', 'Then she suddenly smiled.', '\"Your father would have been proud,\" she said. \"He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.\"', '\"You\\'re joking.\"', \"It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it.\", '\"Seeker?\" he said. \"But first years never -- you must be the youngest house player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. \"Wood told me.\"', 'Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.', '\"I start training next week,\" said Harry. \"Only don\\'t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.\"', 'Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.', '\"Well done,\" said George in a low voice. \"Wood told us.

When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?\"', '\"You\\'re a lot braver now that you\\'re back on the ground and you\\'ve got your little friends with you,\" said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.', '\"I\\'d take you on anytime on my own,\" said Malfoy. \"Tonight, if you want.', 'Wizard\\'s duel.

Never heard of a wizard\\'s duel before, I suppose?\"', '\"Of course he has,\" said Ron, wheeling around. \"I\\'m his second, who\\'s yours?\"', 'Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.', '\"Crabbe,\" he said. \"Midnight all right? We\\'ll meet you in the trophy room; that\\'s always unlocked.\"', 'When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. \"What is a wizard\\'s duel?\" said Harry. \"And what do you mean, you\\'re my second?\"', '\"Well, a second\\'s there to take over if you die,\" said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry\\'s face, he added quickly, \"But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy\\'ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\"', '\"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\"', '\"Throw it away and punch him on the nose,\" Ron suggested. \"Excuse me.\"', 'They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.', '\"Can\\'t a person eat in peace in this place?\" said Ron.', 'Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.', '\"I couldn\\'t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying --\"', '\"Bet you could,\" Ron muttered.', '\"--and you mustn\\'t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you\\'ll lose Gryffindor if you\\'re caught, and you\\'re bound to be.', 'It\\'s really very selfish of you.\"', '\"And it\\'s really none of your business,\" said Harry.', '\"Good-bye,\" said Ron.', 'All the same, it wasn\\'t what you\\'d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn\\'t back from the hospital wing).

He couldn't miss it.\", '\"Half-past eleven,\" Ron muttered at last, \"we\\'d better go.\"', 'They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \"I can\\'t believe you\\'re going to do this, Harry.\"', 'A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.', '\"You!\" said Ron furiously. \"Go back to bed!\"', '\"I almost told your brother,\" Hermione snapped, \"Percy -- he\\'s a prefect, he\\'d put a stop to this.\"', \"Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering.\", '\"Come on,\" he said to Ron.

If he finds all three of us I\\'ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.\"', '\"You\\'ve got some nerve --\" said Ron loudly.', '\"Shut up, both of you!\" said Harry sharply. I heard something.\"', 'It was a sort of snuffling.', '\"Mrs. Norris?\" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.', \"It wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\", '\"Thank goodness you found me! I\\'ve been out here for hours, I couldn\\'t remember the new password to get in to bed.\"', '\"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password\\'s \\'Pig snout\\' but it won\\'t help you now, the Fat Lady\\'s gone off somewhere.\"', '\"How\\'s your arm?\" said Harry.', '\"Fine,\" said Neville, showing them. \"Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.\"', '\"Good - well, look, Neville, we\\'ve got to be somewhere, we\\'ll see you later --\"', '\"Don\\'t leave me!\" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \"I don\\'t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron\\'s been past twice already.\"', 'Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.', '\"If either of you get us caught, I\\'ll never rest until I\\'ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.', 'Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.', 'They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.', \"Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.\", '\"He\\'s late, maybe he\\'s chickened out,\" Ron whispered.', \"Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasn't Malfoy.\", '\"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\"', \"It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice. Neville's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.\", '\"They\\'re in here somewhere,\" they heard him mutter, \"probably hiding.\"', '\"This way!\" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run -he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.', 'The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.', '\"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.', '\"I think we\\'ve lost him,\" Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.', 'I -- told -you,\" Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, \"I -- told -- you.\"', '\"We\\'ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\" said Ron, \"quickly as possible.\"', '\"Malfoy tricked you,\" Hermione said to Harry. \"You realize that, don\\'t you? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\"', \"Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her that.\", '\"Let\\'s go.\"', \"It wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.\", 'It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.', '\"Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you\\'ll get us thrown out.\"', 'Peeves cackled.', '\"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you\\'ll get caughty.\"', '\"Not if you don\\'t give us away, Peeves, please.\"', '\"Should tell Filch, I should,\" said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. \"It\\'s for your own good, you know.\"', '\"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake.', '\"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\" Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR\"', 'Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked.', '\"This is it!\" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \"We\\'re done for! This is the end!\" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves\\'s shouts.', '\"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry\\'s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \\'Alohomora!\"', 'The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.', '\"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\"', '\"Say \\'please.\"\\' \"Don\\'t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\"', '\"Shan\\'t say nothing if you don\\'t say please,\" said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.', '\"All right -please.\"', '\"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\\'t say nothing if you didn\\'t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.', '\"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \"I think we\\'ll be okay -- get off, Neville!\" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry\\'s bathrobe for the last minute. \"What?\"', \"Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.\", \"They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.\", 'They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads.', 'Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.', \"It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\", \"Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he'd take Filch.\", \"They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\", '\"Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.', '\"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.', \"It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.\", '\"What do they think they\\'re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one does.\"', 'Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \"You don\\'t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \"Didn\\'t you see what it was standing on.', '\"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn\\'t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\"', '\"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\\'s obviously guarding something.\"', 'She stood up, glaring at them.', 'I hope you\\'re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled. Now, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'m going to bed.\"', 'Ron stared after her, his mouth open.', '\"No, we don\\'t mind,\" he said. \"You\\'d think we dragged her along, wouldn\\'t you.', 'But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.', 'It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.', \"Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.\", 'Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. \"It\\'s either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron.', '\"Or both,\" said Harry.', \"But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\", 'Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.', 'Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.', \"As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\", 'Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.', \"It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session.\", 'Professor McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.', '\"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously. \"I\\'ve never even touched one.\"', 'They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.', '\"That\\'s a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \"You\\'ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren\\'t allowed them.\"', \"Ron couldn't resist it.\", '\"It\\'s not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"it\\'s a Nimbus Two Thousand.', 'What did you say you\\'ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\" Ron grinned at Harry. \"Comets look flashy, but they\\'re not in the same league as the Nimbus.\"', '\"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\\'t afford half the handle,\" Malfoy snapped back. \"I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\"', \"Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow.\", '\"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked.', '\"Potter\\'s been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly.', '\"Yes, yes, that\\'s right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.', '\"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?\"', '\"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy\\'s face. \"And it\\'s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\\'ve got it,\" he added.', 'Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy\\'s obvious rage and confusion. \"Well, it\\'s true,\" Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \"If he hadn\\'t stolen Neville\\'s Remembrall I wouln\\'t be on the team....\"', '\"So I suppose you think that\\'s a reward for breaking rules?\" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry\\'s hand.', '\"I thought you weren\\'t speaking to us?\" said Harry.', '\"Yes, don\\'t stop now,\" said Ron, \"it\\'s doing us so much good.\"', 'Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.', \"Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\", '\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\\'s bedspread.', 'Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.', \"As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\", 'Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.', '\"Hey, Potter, come down!\\' Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.', '\"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \"I see what McGonagall meant... you really are a natural. I\\'m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you\\'ll be joining team practice three times a week.\"', 'He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.', '\"Right,\" said Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it\\'s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side.', 'Three of them are called Chasers.\"', '\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.', '\"This ball\\'s called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. \"The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\"', '\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\"', 'Harry recited. \"So -- that\\'s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn\\'t it?\"', '\"What\\'s basketball?\" said Wood curiously. \"Never mind,\" said Harry quickly.', '\"Now, there\\'s another player on each side who\\'s called the Keeper -I\\'m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\"', '\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.', '\"I\\'ll show you now,\" said Wood. \"Take this.\"', 'He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.', '\"I\\'m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said. \"These two are the Bludgers.\"', 'He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.', '\"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.', \"At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\", '\"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That\\'s why you have two Beaters on each team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it\\'s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So -- think you\\'ve got all that?\"', '\"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\" Harry reeled off.', '\"Very good,\" said Wood.', '\"Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\" Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.', '\"Never at Hogwarts. We\\'ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That\\'s you. And you don\\'t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers unless they crack my head open.\"', '\"Don\\'t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I mean, they\\'re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\"', 'Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.', 'Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.', '\"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it\\'s the most important ball of the lot. It\\'s very hard to catch because it\\'s so fast and difficult to see. It\\'s the Seeker\\'s job to catch it. You\\'ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team\\'s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That\\'s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages -- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. \"Well, that\\'s it -- any questions?\"', 'Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.', '\"We won\\'t practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \"it\\'s too dark, we might lose it. Let\\'s try you out with a few of these.\"', 'He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.', \"Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.\", '\"That Quidditch cup\\'ll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn\\'t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn\\'t gone off chasing dragons.\"', \"Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\", \"On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.\", '\"Now, don\\'t forget that nice wrist movement we\\'ve been practicing!\"', 'squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said \\'s\\' instead of \\'f\\' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\"', 'It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.', \"Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.\", '\"Wingardium Leviosa!\" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.', '\"You\\'re saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap. \"It\\'s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the \\'gar\\' nice and long.\"', '\"You do it, then, if you\\'re so clever,\" Ron snarled.', 'Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"', 'Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.', '\"Oh, well done!\" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \"Everyone see here, Miss Granger\\'s done it!\"', 'Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \"It\\'s no wonder no one can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \"she\\'s a nightmare, honestly. \\x93', 'Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione.', 'Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears.', '\"I think she heard you.\"', '\"So?\" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \"She must\\'ve noticed she\\'s got no friends.\"', \"Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone.\", 'Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.', 'A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.', 'Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.', 'Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\\'s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \"Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know.\"', 'He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.', \"There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.\", '\"Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\"', 'Percy was in his element.', '\"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I\\'m a prefect!\"', '\"How could a troll get in?\" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.', '\"Don\\'t ask me, they\\'re supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron. \"Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\"', 'They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.', \"As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.\", '\"I\\'ve just thought -- Hermione.\"', '\"What about her?\"', '\"She doesn\\'t know about the troll.\"', 'Ron bit his lip.', '\"Oh, all right,\" he snapped. \"But Percy\\'d better not see us.\"', \"Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.\", '\"Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.', 'Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.', '\"What\\'s he doing?\" Harry whispered. \"Why isn\\'t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\"', '\"Search me.\"', \"Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps.\", '\"He\\'s heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.', '\"Can you smell something?\"', 'Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.', 'And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.', 'It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.', 'The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.', '\"The keys in the lock,\" Harry muttered. \"We could lock it in.\"', '\"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously.', \"They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.\", '\\'Yes!\"', \"Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up.\", '\"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.', '\"It\\'s the girls\\' bathroom!\" Harry gasped.', '\"Hermione!\" they said together.', 'It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.', 'Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.', '\"Confuse it!\" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.', 'The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.', '\"Oy, pea-brain!\" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn\\'t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.', '\"Come on, run, run!\" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn\\'t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.', 'The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.', \"Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.\", 'Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.', 'Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"', \"The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.\", 'Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.', 'It was Hermione who spoke first.', '\"Is it -- dead?\"', 'I don\\'t think so,\" said Harry, I think it\\'s just been knocked out.\"', \"He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.\", '\"Urgh -- troll boogers.\"', \"He wiped it on the troll's trousers.\", 'A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.', \"They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\", 'Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white.', \"Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind.\", '\"What on earth were you thinking of?\" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice.

It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\"', \"Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.\", '\"Well -- in that case...\" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\"', 'Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.', '\"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I\\'m very disappointed in you. If you\\'re not hurt at all, you\\'d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.\"', 'Hermione left.', 'Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.', '\"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\"', \"They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up.

Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \"Thanks,\" and hurried off to get plates.', \"But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\", 'As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.', 'The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.', \"Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.\", \"It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.\", 'Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.', \"Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.\", \"They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed.

He hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.\", '\"What\\'s that you\\'ve got there, Potter?\"', 'It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.', '\"Library books are not to be taken outside the school,\" said Snape.', '\"Give it to me.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron\\'s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\"How will you learn?\"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.', 'Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.', '\"Better you than me,\" they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn\\'t refuse if there were other teachers listening.', 'He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer.', 'He knocked again. Nothing.', 'Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try.

As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined.

The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.\", \"Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\", '\"What are you looking for, boy?\"', '\"Nothing,\" said Harry.', 'Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.', '\"You\\'d better get out, then.

They were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to.\", \"Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.\", 'Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.', 'They went off to lunch.', '\"You will keep looking while I\\'m away, won\\'t you?\" said Hermione. \"And send me an owl if you find anything.\"', '\"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said Ron.', '\"It\\'d be safe to ask them.\"', '\"Very safe, as they\\'re both dentists,\" said Hermione.', \"Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows -- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work.\", \"Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered.\", \"Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.\", 'Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn\\'t trust him at all. He wasn\\'t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \"Don\\'t send me there, can\\'t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.\" On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.', 'When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.', '\"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.', '\"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I\\'ve got some presents!\"', '\"What did you expect, turnips?\" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry\\'s.', 'Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it -- it sounded a bit like an owl.', 'A second, very small parcel contained a note.', 'We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.', '\"That\\'s friendly,\" said Harry.', 'Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.', '\"Weird!\" he said, \\'NMat a shape! This is money?\"', '\"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \"Hagrid and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?\"', '\"I think I know who that one\\'s from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \"My mom. I told her you didn\\'t expect any presents and -- oh, no,\" he groaned, \"she\\'s made you a Weasley sweater.\"', 'Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.', '\"Every year she makes us a sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping his own, \"and mine\\'s always maroon.\"', '\"That\\'s really nice of her,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.', 'His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.', 'This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.', 'Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.', '\"I\\'ve heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he\\'d gotten from Hermione. \"If that\\'s what I think it is -- they\\'re really rare, and really valuable.\"', '\"What is it?\"', 'Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.', '\"It\\'s an invisibility cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \"I\\'m sure it is -- try it on.\"', 'Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.', '\"It is! Look down!\"', 'Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.', '\"There\\'s a note!\" said Ron suddenly. \"A note fell out of it!\"', 'Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.', 'A Very Merry Christmas to you.', 'There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak.', '\"I\\'d give anything for one of these,\" he said. \"Anything. What\\'s the matter?\"', '\"Nothing,\" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father? Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn\\'t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.', '\"Merry Christmas!\"', '\"Hey, look -- Harry\\'s got a Weasley sweater, too!\"', 'Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.', '\"Harry\\'s is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry\\'s sweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you\\'re not family.\"', '\"Why aren\\'t you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded. \"Come on, get it on, they\\'re lovely and warm.\"', '\"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.', '\"You haven\\'t got a letter on yours,\" George observed. \"I suppose she thinks you don\\'t forget your name. But we\\'re not stupid -- we know we\\'re called Gred and Forge.\"', '\"What\\'s all th is noise.', 'Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.', '\"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\\'re all wearing ours, even Harry got one.\"', '\"I -- don\\'t -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.', '\"And you\\'re not sitting with the prefects today, either,\" said George. \"Christmas is a time for family.\"', 'They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.', \"Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.\", \"Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.\", 'When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.', \"The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.\", \"Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.\", \"After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge.\", \"It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.\", \"Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.\", \"His father's... this had been his father's. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.\", 'He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.', 'Use it well.', 'Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.', \"Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back -- his father's cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he wanted to use it alone.\", 'He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.', '\"Who\\'s there?\" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.', \"Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.\", 'He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked.', 'The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.', 'The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.', \"They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all.\", \"One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.\", 'He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.', \"A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears.\", \"He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.\", '\"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody\\'s been in the library Restricted Section.\"', 'Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section? Well, they can\\'t be far, we\\'ll catch them.\"', \"Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak didn't stop him from being solid.\", 'He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.', \"It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.\", 'It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.', 'He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.', 'But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.', \"There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the others existed only in the mirror.\", \"She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did.\", 'Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.', '\"Mom?\" he whispered. \"Dad?\"', \"They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\", 'The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.', 'How long he stood there, he didn\\'t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn\\'t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother\\'s face, whispered, \"I\\'ll come back,\"', 'and hurried from the room.', '\"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly.', '\"You can come tonight, I\\'m going back, I want to show you the mirror.', '\"I\\'d like to see your mom and dad,\" Ron said eagerly.', '\"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\\'ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\"', '\"You can see them any old time,\" said Ron. \"Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren\\'t you eating anything?\"', 'Harry couldn\\'t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn\\'t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? \"Are you all right?\" said Ron. \"You look odd.\"', \"What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.\", '\"I\\'m freezing,\" said Ron. \"Let\\'s forget it and go back.\"', '\"No!\" Harry hissed. I know it\\'s here somewhere.\"', 'They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.', '\"It\\'s here -- just here -- yes!\"', 'They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.', 'There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.', '\"See?\" Harry whispered.', '\"I can\\'t see anything.\"', '\"Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them....\"', '\"I can only see you.\"', '\"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\"', \"Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\", 'Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.', '\"Look at me!\" he said.', '\"Can you see all your family standing around you?\"', '\"No -- I\\'m alone -- but I\\'m different -- I look older -- and I\\'m head boy!\"', '\"What?\"', '\"I am -- I\\'m wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I\\'m holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I\\'m Quidditch captain, too.', 'Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.', '\"Do you think this mirror shows the future?\"', '\"How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look --\"', '\"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\"', '\"You\\'re only holding the Quidditch cup, what\\'s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.\"', '\"Don\\'t push me --\"', 'A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.', \"They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking.\", '\"Quick!\"', 'Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing -- did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left.', '\"This isn\\'t safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.', 'Come on.\"', 'And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.', \"The snow still hadn't melted the next morning.\", '\"Want to play chess, Harry?\" said Ron.', '\"No.\"', '\"Why don\\'t we go down and visit Hagrid?\"', '\"No... you go...\"', '\"I know what you\\'re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don\\'t go back tonight.\"', '\"Why not?\"', '\"I dunno, I\\'ve just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you\\'ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can\\'t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?\"', '\"You sound like Hermione.\"', '\"I\\'m serious, Harry, don\\'t go.\"', \"But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.\", \"That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone.\", 'And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.', 'Except -- \"So -- back again, Harry?\"', \"Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.\", '\" -- I didn\\'t see you, sir.\"', '\"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.', '\"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\"', '\"I didn\\'t know it was called that, Sir.\"', '\"But I expect you\\'ve realized by now what it does?\"', '\"It -- well -- it shows me my family --\"', '\"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.\"', '\"How did you know --?\"', '\"I don\\'t need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently.', '\"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\"', 'Harry shook his head.', '\"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\"', 'Harry thought. Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want...', 'whatever we want...\"', '\"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.', '\"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don\\'t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\"', 'Harry stood up.', '\"Sir -- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\"', '\"Obviously, you\\'ve just done so,\" Dumbledore smiled. \"You may ask me one more thing, however.\"', '\"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\"', '\"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\"', 'Harry stared.', '\"One can never have enough socks,\" said Dumbledore. \"Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn\\'t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.\"', 'It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.', \"Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.\", '\"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said Ron, when Harry told him about these drearns.', 'Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If Filch had caught you!\"), and disappointment that he hadn\\'t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.', \"They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li- brary book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere.\", 'Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.', \"Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.\", \"Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He'd just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.\", '\"Will you stop messing around!\" he yelled. \"That\\'s exactly the sort of thing that\\'ll lose us the match! Snape\\'s refereeing this time, and he\\'ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\"', 'George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.', '\"Snape\\'s refereeing?\" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \"When\\'s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He\\'s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.\"', 'The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.', '\"It\\'s not my fault,\" said Wood. \"We\\'ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn\\'t got an excuse to pick on us.\"', 'Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....', 'The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.', '\"Don\\'t talk to me for a moment,\" said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, \"I need to concen --\" He caught sight of Harry\\'s face. \"What\\'s the matter with you? You look terrible.\"', \"Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\", '\"Don\\'t play,\" said Hermione at once.', '\"Say you\\'re ill,\" said Ron.', '\"Pretend to break your leg,\" Hermione suggested.', '\"Really break your leg,\" said Ron.', '\"I can\\'t,\" said Harry. \"There isn\\'t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can\\'t play at all.\"', \"At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.\", 'Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville\\'s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \"What happened?\" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.', '\"Malfoy,\" said Neville shakily. \"I met him outside the library. He said he\\'d been looking for someone to practice that on.\"', '\"Go to Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione urged Neville. \"Report him!\"', 'Neville shook his head.', '\"I don\\'t want more trouble,\" he mumbled.', '\"You\\'ve got to stand up to him, Neville!\" said Ron. \"He\\'s used to walking all over people, but that\\'s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.\"', '\"There\\'s no need to tell me I\\'m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy\\'s already done that,\" Neville choked out.', 'Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.', '\"You\\'re worth twelve of Malfoy,\" Harry said. \"The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn\\'t it? And where\\'s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\"', \"Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.\", '\"Thanks, Harry... I think I\\'ll go to bed.... D\\'you want the card, you collect them, don\\'t you?\"', 'As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.', '\"Dumbledore again,\" he said, \"He was the first one I ever-\"', 'He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.', '\"I\\'ve found him!\" he whispered. \"I\\'ve found Flamel! I told you I\\'d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here -- listen to this: \\'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\\'s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel\\'!\"', \"Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\", '\"Stay there!\" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls\\' dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.', '\"I never thought to look in here!\" she whispered excitedly. \"I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\"', '\"Light?\" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she\\'d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.', 'At last she found what she was looking for.', '\"I knew it! I knew it!\"', '\"Are we allowed to speak yet?\" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.', '\"Nicolas Flamel,\" she whispered dramatically, \"is the only known maker of the Sorcerer\\'s Stone!\"', \"This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected.\", '\"The what?\" said Harry and Ron.', '\"Oh, honestly, don\\'t you two read? Look -- read that, there.\"', \"She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.\", \"There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).\", '\"See?\" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \"The dog must be guarding Flamel\\'s Sorcerer\\'s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they\\'re friends and he knew someone was after it, that\\'s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\"', '\"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\" said Harry. \"No wonder Snape\\'s after it! Anyone would want it.\"', '\"And no wonder we couldn\\'t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\" said Ron. \"He\\'s not exactly recent if he\\'s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?\"', \"The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one. It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.\", '\"I\\'m going to play,\" he told Ron and Hermione. \"If I don\\'t, all the Slytherins will think I\\'m just too scared to face Snape. I\\'ll show them... it\\'ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\"', '\"Just as long as we\\'re not wiping you off the field,\" said Hermione.', \"As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee? Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the Sorcerer's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\", \"Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\", \"Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\", '\"Now, don\\'t forget, it\\'s Locomotor Mortis,\" Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.', '\"I know,\" Ron snapped. \"Don\\'t nag.\"', 'Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.', '\"Don\\'t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it\\'s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.\"', '\"The whole school\\'s out there!\" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. \"Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore\\'s come to watch!\"', \"Harry's heart did a somersault.\", '\"Dumbledore?\" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right.', 'There was no mistaking that silver beard.', 'Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.', 'Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.', '\"I\\'ve never seen Snape look so mean,\" he told Hermione. \"Look -they\\'re off Ouch!\"', 'Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.', '\"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn\\'t see you there.\"', 'Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.', '\"Wonder how long Potter\\'s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\"', \"Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\", '\"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \"It\\'s people they feel sorry for. See, there\\'s Potter, who\\'s got no parents, then there\\'s the Weasleys, who\\'ve got no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you\\'ve got no brains.\"', 'Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.', '\"I\\'m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\" he stammered.', 'Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, \"You tell him, Neville.\"', '\"Longbottom, if brains were gold you\\'d be poorer than Weasley, and that\\'s saying something.\"', \"Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.\", '\"I\\'m warning you, Malfoy -- one more word \"Ron!\" said Hermione suddenly, \"Harry --\"', '\"What? Where?\"', 'Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.', '\"You\\'re in luck, Weasley, Potter\\'s obviously spotted some money on the ground!\" said Malfoy.', 'Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.', '\"Come on, Harry!\" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn\\'t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.', 'Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.', 'The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.', '\"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game\\'s over! Harry\\'s won! We\\'ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.', \"Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn't believe it. He'd done it -- the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face.\", '\"Well done,\" said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear.', '\"Nice to see you haven\\'t been brooding about that mirror... been keeping busy... excellent...\"', 'Snape spat bitterly on the ground.', \"Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now -- no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.\", 'Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.', \"Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape....\", 'And speaking of Snape...', \"A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure's prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on? Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.\", \"The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.\", \"He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell was there, too.\", \"Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.\", '\"... d-don\\'t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus...\"', '\"Oh, I thought we\\'d keep this private,\" said Snape, his voice icy.', '\"Students aren\\'t supposed to know about the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, after all.\"', 'Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him.', '\"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid\\'s yet?\"', '\"B-b-but Severus, I --\"', '\"You don\\'t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\" said Snape, taking a step toward him.', '\"I-I don\\'t know what you \"You know perfectly well what I mean.\"', 'An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \"-- your little bit of hocus-pocus.', 'I\\'m waiting.\"', '\"B-but I d-d-don\\'t --\"', '\"Very well,\" Snape cut in. \"We\\'ll have another little chat soon, when you\\'ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.\"', 'He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.', '\"Harry, where have you been?\" Hermione squeaked.', '\"We won! You won! We won!\" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \"And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He\\'s still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he\\'ll be all right - talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone\\'s waiting for you in the common room, we\\'re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.\"', '\"Never mind that now,\" said Harry breathlessly. \"Let\\'s find an empty room, you wait \\'til you hear this....\"', \"He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he'd seen and heard.\", '\"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, and Snape\\'s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell\\'s \\'hocus pocuss-- I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through --\"', '\"So you mean the Stone\\'s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?\" said Hermione in alarm.', '\"It\\'ll be gone by next Tuesday,\" said Ron.', \"Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look as though he'd cracked yet.\", \"Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter.\", \"Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes.\", \"Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.\", '\"Hermione, the exams are ages away.\"', '\"Ten weeks,\" Hermione snapped. \"That\\'s not ages, that\\'s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.\"', '\"But we\\'re not six hundred years old,\" Ron reminded her. \"Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it A.\"', '\"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They\\'re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don\\'t know what\\'s gotten into me....\"', \"Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.\", '\"I\\'ll never remember this,\" Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they\\'d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.', 'Harry, who was looking up \"Dittany\" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn\\'t look up until he heard Ron say, \"Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?\"', 'Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.', '\"Jus\\' lookin\\',\" he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. \"An\\' what\\'re you lot up ter?\" He looked suddenly suspicious. \"Yer not still lookin\\' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\" \"Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,\" said Ron impressively. \"And we know what that dog\\'s guarding, it\\'s a Sorcerer\\'s St --\"', '\"Shhhh!\" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.', '\"Don\\' go shoutin\\' about it, what\\'s the matter with yeh?\"', '\"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\" said Harry, \"about what\\'s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy --\"', '\"SHHHH!\" said Hagrid again. \"Listen - come an\\' see me later, I\\'m not promisin\\' I\\'ll tell yeh anythin\\', mind, but don\\' go rabbitin\\' about it in here, students aren\\' s\\'pposed ter know. They\\'ll think I\\'ve told yeh --\"', '\"See you later, then,\" said Harry.', 'Hagrid shuffled off.', '\"What was he hiding behind his back?\" said Hermione thoughtfully.', '\"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\"', '\"I\\'m going to see what section he was in,\" said Ron, who\\'d had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.', '\"Dragons!\" he whispered. \"Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper\\'s Guide.\"', '\"Hagrid\\'s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, \" said Harry.', '\"But it\\'s against our laws,\" said Ron. \"Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks\\' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It\\'s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we\\'re keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway, you can\\'t tame dragons, it\\'s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie\\'s got off wild ones in Romania.\"', '\"But there aren\\'t wild dragons in Britain?\" said Harry.', '\"Of course there are,\" said Ron. \"Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you.', 'Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who\\'ve spotted them, to make them forget.\"', '\"So what on earths Hagrid up to?\" said Hermione.', 'When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\\'s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called \"Who is it?\" before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.', 'It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.', '\"So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin\\'?\"', '\"Yes,\" said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. \"We were wondering if you could tell us what\\'s guarding the Sorcerer\\'s Stone apart from Fluffy.\"', 'Hagrid frowned at him.', '\"0\\' course I cant, he said. \"Number one, I don\\' know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn\\' tell yeh if I could. That Stone\\'s here fer a good reason. It Was almost stolen outta Gringotts - I s\\'ppose yeh\\'ve worked that out an\\' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou\\' Fluffy.\"', '\"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,\" said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid\\'s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. \"We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.\" Hermione went on. \"We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.\"', \"Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.\", '\"Well, I don\\' s\\'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let\\'s see... he borrowed Fluffy from me... then some o\\' the teachers did enchantments...', 'Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall --\" he ticked them off on his fingers, \"Professor Quirrell -- an\\' Dumbledore himself did somethin\\', o\\' course. Hang on, I\\'ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.\"', '\"Snape?\"', '\"Yeah -- yer not still on abou\\' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he\\'s not about ter steal it.\"', \"Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything -- except, it seemed, Quirrell's spell and how to get past Fluffy.\", '\"You\\'re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren\\'t you, Hagrid?\" said Harry anxiously. \"And you wouldn\\'t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?\"', '\"Not a soul knows except me an\\' Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid proudly.', '\"Well, that\\'s something,\" Harry muttered to the others. \"Hagrid, can we have a window open? I\\'m boiling.\"', '\"Can\\'t, Harry, sorry,\" said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.', '\"Hagrid -- what\\'s that?\"', 'But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.', '\"Ah,\" said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \"That\\'s er...\"', '\"Where did you get it, Hagrid?\" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. \"It must\\'ve cost you a fortune.\"', '\"Won it,\" said Hagrid. \"Las\\' night. I was down in the village havin\\' a few drinks an\\' got into a game o\\' cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\"', '\"But what are you going to do with it when it\\'s hatched?\" said Hermione.', '\"Well, I\\'ve bin doin\\' some readin\\' , said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. \"Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit -- it\\'s a bit outta date, o\\' course, but it\\'s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, \\'cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an\\' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o\\' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An\\' see here -- how ter recognize diff\\'rent eggs -- what I got there\\'s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They\\'re rare, them.\"', \"He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't.\", '\"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,\" she said.', \"But Hagrid wasn't listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.\", 'So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.', '\"Wonder what it\\'s like to have a peaceful life,\" Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.', 'Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.', \"He had written only two words: It's hatching.\", \"Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn't hear of it.\", '\"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?\"', '\"We\\'ve got lessons, we\\'ll get into trouble, and that\\'s nothing to what Hagrid\\'s going to be in when someone finds out what he\\'s doing --\"', '\"Shut up!\" Harry whispered.', \"Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all.\", \"Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.\", '\"It\\'s nearly out.\" He ushered them inside.', 'The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.', 'They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.', \"All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.\", 'It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.', '\"Isn\\'t he beautiful?\" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon\\'s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.', '\"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!\" said Hagrid.', '\"Hagrid,\" said Hermione, \"how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?\"', 'Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face -- he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.', '\"What\\'s the matter?\"', '\"Someone was lookin\\' through the gap in the curtains -- it\\'s a kid -- he\\'s runnin\\' back up ter the school.\"', 'Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him.', 'Malfoy had seen the dragon.', \"Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\", '\"Just let him go,\" Harry urged. \"Set him free.\"', '\"I can\\'t,\" said Hagrid. \"He\\'s too little. He\\'d die.\"', \"They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn't been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\", '\"I\\'ve decided to call him Norbert,\" said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. \"He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where\\'s Mommy?\"', '\"He\\'s lost his marbles,\" Ron muttered in Harry\\'s ear.', '\"Hagrid,\" said Harry loudly, \"give it two weeks and Norbert\\'s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\"', 'Hagrid bit his lip.', '\"I -- I know I can\\'t keep him forever, but I can\\'t jus\\' dump him, I can\\'t.\"', 'Harry suddenly turned to Ron. Charlie, he said.', '\"You\\'re losing it, too,\" said Ron. \"I\\'m Ron, remember?\"', '\"No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons.', 'We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!\"', '\"Brilliant!\" said Ron. \"How about it, Hagrid?\"', 'And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send -an owl to Charlie to ask him.', \"The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak. He had been down at Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.\", '\"It bit me!\" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. \"I\\'m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon\\'s the most horrible animal I\\'ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you\\'d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit.

And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\"', 'There was a tap on the dark window.', '\"It\\'s Hedwig!\" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \"She\\'ll have Charlie\\'s answer!\"', 'The three of them put their heads together to read the note.', 'Dear Ron,', \"How are you? Thanks for the letter -- I'd be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week.

They can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark.\", 'Send me an answer as soon as possible.', 'Love,', 'Charlie', 'They looked at one another.', '\"We\\'ve got the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It shouldn\\'t be too difficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\"', 'It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy.', \"There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert's fangs were poisonous.\", 'Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.', '\"It\\'s not just my hand,\" he whispered, \"although that feels like it\\'s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I\\'ve told her it was a dog, but I don\\'t think she believes me -I shouldn\\'t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that\\'s why he\\'s doing this.\"', 'Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.', '\"It\\'ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\" said Hermione, but this didn\\'t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.', '\"Midnight on Saturday!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"Oh no oh no -- I\\'ve just remembered -- Charlie\\'s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he\\'s going to know we\\'re getting rid of Norbert.\"', \"Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\", '\"It\\'s too late to change the plan now,\" Harry told Hermione. \"We haven\\'t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We\\'ll have to risk it.

It\\'s all right, he only got my boot -- jus\\' playin\\' -- he\\'s only a baby, after all.\"', \"The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough.\", \"They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.\", '\"He\\'s got lots o\\' rats an\\' some brandy fer the journey,\" said Hagrid in a muffled voice. \"An\\' I\\'ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\"', 'From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.', '\"Bye-bye, Norbert!\" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.', '\"Mommy will never forget you!\"', \"How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another staircase, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier.\", '\"Nearly there!\" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.', 'Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate.', 'Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.', 'Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.', '\"Detention!\" she shouted. \"And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you --\"', '\"You don\\'t understand, Professor. Harry Potter\\'s coming -- he\\'s got a dragon!\"', '\"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\"', \"The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\", '\"Malfoy\\'s got detention! I could sing!\"', '\"Don\\'t,\" Harry advised her.', 'Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.', \"Charlie's friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.\", 'They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.', 'At last, Norbert was going... going... gone.', \"They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy in detention -- what could spoil their happiness? The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.\", '\"Well, well, well,\" he whispered, \"we are in trouble.\"', \"They'd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.\", \"Things couldn't have been worse.\", \"Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn't see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.\", \"Had Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong.\", 'When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.', '\"Harry!\" Neville burst Out, the moment he saw the other two. \"I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag --\"', 'Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.', '\"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. It\\'s one o\\'clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.\"', \"It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.\", '\"I think I\\'ve got a good idea of what\\'s been going on,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"It doesn\\'t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I\\'ve already caught him. I suppose you think it\\'s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\"', \"Harry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville -- Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.\", '\"I\\'m disgusted,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Four students out of bed in one night! I\\'ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions -- yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it\\'s very dangerous -- and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.\"', '\"Fifty?\" Harry gasped -- they would lose the lead, the lead he\\'d won in the last Quidditch match.', '\"Fifty points each,\" said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.', '\"Professor -- please \"You can\\'t --\"', '\"Don\\'t tell me what I can and can\\'t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I\\'ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.\"', \"A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this? Harry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they'd done? At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there'd been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lo st them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.\", 'From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn\\'t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, \"Thanks Potter, we owe you one!\"', 'Only Ron stood by him.', '\"They\\'ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they\\'ve been here, and people still like them.\"', '\"They\\'ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?\" said Harry miserably.', '\"Well -- no,\" Ron admitted.', \"It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on. He'd had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.\", '\"Resign?\" Wood thundered. \"What good\\'ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can\\'t win at Quidditch?\"', 'But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn\\'t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him \"the Seeker.\"', \"Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn't have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.\", \"Harry was almost glad that the exams weren't far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions....\", \"Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell's voice.\", '\"No -- no -- not again, please --\"', 'It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.', '\"All right -- all right --\" he heard Quirrell sob.', \"Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him.\", \"He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end.\", \"Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling.\", \"All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step -- Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\", \"Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he'd heard.\", '\"Snape\\'s done it, then!\" said Ron. \"If Quirrell\\'s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell --\"', '\"There\\'s still Fluffy, though,\" said Hermione.', '\"Maybe Snape\\'s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\"', 'said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \"I bet there\\'s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\"', \"The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.\", '\"Go to Dumbledore. That\\'s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we\\'ll be thrown out for sure.\"', '\"But we\\'ve got no proof!\" said Harry. \"Quirrell\\'s too scared to back us up. Snape\\'s only got to say he doesn\\'t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you think they\\'ll believe, him or us? It\\'s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore\\'ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn\\'t help us if his life depended on it, he\\'s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he\\'ll think. And don\\'t forget, we\\'re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That\\'ll take a lot of explaining.\"', \"Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't.\", '\"If we just do a bit of poking around --\"', '\"No,\" said Harry flatly, \"we\\'ve done enough poking around.\"', 'He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons.', \"The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same: Your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight. Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.\", \"Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they'd lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they'd got.\", \"At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there -- and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.\", '\"Follow me,\" said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.', 'I bet you\\'ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won\\'t you, eh?\" he said, leering at them. \"Oh yes... hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me.... It\\'s just a pity they let the old punishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I\\'ve got the chains still in my office, keep \\'em well oiled in case they\\'re ever needed.... Right, off we go, and don\\'t think of running off, now, it\\'ll be worse for you if you do.\"', \"They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted.\", \"The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's hut. Then they heard a distant shout.\", '\"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\"', 'Harry\\'s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn\\'t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his -face, because Filch said, \"I suppose you think you\\'ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy -- it\\'s into the forest you\\'re going and I\\'m much mistaken if you\\'ll all come out in one piece.\"', 'At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.', '\"The forest?\" he repeated, and he didn\\'t sound quite as cool as usual.', '\"We can\\'t go in there at night -- there\\'s all sorts of things in there -- werewolves, I heard.\"', \"Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise.\", '\"That\\'s your problem, isn\\'t it?\" said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. \"Should\\'ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn\\'t you?\"', 'Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.', '\"Abou\\' time,\" he said. \"I bin waitin\\' fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?\"', '\"I shouldn\\'t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\" said Filch coldly, they\\'re here to be punished, after all.\"', '\"That\\'s why yer late, is it?\" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \"Bin lecturin\\' them, eh? \\'Snot your place ter do that. Yeh\\'ve done yer bit, I\\'ll take over from here.\"', '\"I\\'ll be back at dawn,\" said Filch, \"for what\\'s left of them,\" he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.', 'Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.', '\"I\\'m not going in that forest, he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.', '\"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\" said Hagrid fiercely.', '\"Yeh\\'ve done wrong an\\' now yehve got ter pay fer it.\"', '\"But this is servant stuff, it\\'s not for students to do. I thought we\\'d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he\\'d tell yer that\\'s how it is at Hogwarts,\" Hagrid growled. \"Copyin\\' lines! What good\\'s that ter anyone? Yeh\\'ll do summat useful or Yeh\\'ll get out.', 'If yeh think yer father\\'d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an\\' pack. Go on\"\\' Malfoy didn\\'t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze.', '\"Right then,\" said Hagrid, \"now, listen carefully, \\'cause it\\'s dangerous what we\\'re gonna do tonight, an\\' I don\\' want no one takin\\' risks. Follow me over here a moment.\"', 'He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.', '\"Look there,\" said Hagrid, \"see that stuff shinin\\' on the ground? Silvery stuff? That\\'s unicorn blood. There\\'s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We\\'re gonna try an\\' find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.\"', '\"And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\" said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.', '\"There\\'s nothin\\' that lives in the forest that\\'ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\' keep ter the path. Right, now, we\\'re gonna split inter two parties an\\' follow the trail in diff\\'rent directions.

Get yer wands out an\\' practice now -- that\\'s it -- an\\' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an\\' we\\'ll all come an\\' find yeh -- so, be careful -- let\\'s go.\"', 'The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.', 'They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.', 'Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.', '\"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\" Harry asked.', '\"Not fast enough,\" said Hagrid. \"It\\'s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they\\'re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.\"', 'They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.', '\"You all right, Hermione?\" Hagrid whispered. \"Don\\' worry, it can\\'t\\'ve gone far if it\\'s this badly hurt, an\\' then we\\'ll be able ter -- GET BEHIND THAT TREE!\"', 'Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.', '\"I knew it, \" he murmured. \"There\\'s summat in here that shouldn\\' be.\"', '\"A werewolf?\" Harry suggested.', '\"That wasn\\' no werewolf an\\' it wasn\\' no unicorn, neither,\" said Hagrid grimly. \"Right, follow me, but careful, now.\"', 'They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound.', 'Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.', '\"Who\\'s there?\" Hagrid called. \"Show yerself -- I\\'m armed!\"', \"And into the clearing came -- was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione's jaws dropped.\", '\"Oh, it\\'s you, Ronan,\" said Hagrid in relief. \"How are yeh?\"', \"He walked forward and shook the centaur's hand.\", '\"Good evening to you, Hagrid,\" said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. \"Were you going to shoot me?\"', '\"Can\\'t be too careful, Ronan,\" said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.', '\"There\\'s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an\\' Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An\\' this is Ronan, you two. He\\'s a centaur.)) \"We\\'d noticed,\" said Hermione faintly.', '\"Good evening,\" said Ronan. \"Students, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?\"', '\"Erm --\"', '\"A bit,\" said Hermione timidly.', '\"A bit. Well, that\\'s something.\" Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. \"Mars is bright tonight.\"', '\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \"Listen, I\\'m glad we\\'ve run inter yeh, Ronan, \\'cause there\\'s a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin\\'?\"', \"Ronan didn't answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again.\", '\"Always the innocent are the first victims,\" he said. \"So it has been for ages past, so it is now.\"', '\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"but have yeh seen anythin\\', Ronan? Anythin\\' unusual?\"', '\"Mars is bright tonight,\" Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. \"Unusually bright.\"', '\"Yeah, but I was meanin\\' anythin\\' unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid. \"So yeh haven\\'t noticed anythin\\' strange?\"', 'Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, \"The forest hides many secrets.\"', 'A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.', '\"Hullo, Bane,\" said Hagrid. \"All right?\"', '\"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\"', '\"Well enough. Look, I\\'ve jus\\' bin askin\\' Ronan, you seen anythin\\' odd in here lately? There\\'s a unicorn bin injured -- would yeh know anythin\\' about it?\"', 'Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. \"Mars is bright tonight,\" he said simply.', '\"We\\'ve heard,\" said Hagrid grumpily. \"Well, if either of you do see anythin\\', let me know, won\\'t yeh? We\\'ll be off, then.\"', 'Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.', '\"Never,\" said Hagrid irritably, \"try an\\' get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin\\' closer\\'n the moon.\"', '\"Are there many of them in here?\" asked Hermione.', '\"Oh, a fair few... Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they\\'re good enough about turnin\\' up if ever I want a word. They\\'re deep, mind, centaurs... they know things... jus\\' don\\' let on much.\"', '\"D\\'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\" said Harry.', '\"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what\\'s bin killin\\' the unicorns -- never heard anythin\\' like it before.\"', 'They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them.', \"They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's arm.\", '\"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\"', '\"You two wait here!\" Hagrid shouted. \"Stay on the path, I\\'ll come back for yeh!\"', \"They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.\", '\"You don\\'t think they\\'ve been hurt, do you?\" whispered Hermione.', '\"I don\\'t care if Malfoy has, but if something\\'s got Neville... it\\'s our fault he\\'s here in the first place.\"', \"The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.\", \"What was going on? Where were the others? At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.\", '\"We\\'ll be lucky ter catch anythin\\' now, with the racket you two were makin\\'. Right, we\\'re changin\\' groups -- Neville, you stay with me an\\' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an\\' this idiot. I\\'m sorry,\" Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, \"but he\\'ll have a harder time frightenin\\' you, an\\' we\\'ve gotta get this done.\"', 'So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.', '\"Look --\" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.', 'Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.', 'It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.', 'Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered....', \"Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.\", '\"AAAAAAAAAARGH!\"', \"Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry -- he couldn't move for fear.\", \"Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.\", \"The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body.\", '\"Are you all right?\" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.', '\"Yes -- thank you -- what was that?\"', \"The centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead.\", '\"You are the Potter boy,\" he said. \"You had better get back to Hagrid.', 'The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.', '\"My name is Firenze,\" he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.', 'There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.', '\"Firenze!\" Bane thundered. \"What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\"', '\"Do you realize who this is?\" said Firenze. \"This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\"', '\"What have you been telling him?\" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?\"', 'Ronan pawed the ground nervously. \"I\\'m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, \" he said in his gloomy voice.', 'Bane kicked his back legs in anger.', '\"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\"', 'Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.', '\"Do you not see that unicorn?\" Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\"', 'And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.', \"Harry didn't have a clue what was going on.\", '\"Why\\'s Bane so angry?\" he asked. \"What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?\"', \"Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\", '\"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?\"', '\"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question. \"We\\'ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\"', '\"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said Firenze. \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\"', \"Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.\", '\"But who\\'d be that desperate?\" he wondered aloud. \"If you\\'re going to be cursed forever, deaths better, isn\\'t it?\"', '\"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die.', 'Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\"', '\"The Sorcerer\\'s Stone! Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I don\\'t understand who --\"', '\"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\"', 'It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry\\'s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \"Some say he died.', 'Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\"', '\"Do you mean,\" Harry croaked, \"that was Vol-\"', '\"Harry! Harry, are you all right?\"', 'Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.', '\"I\\'m fine,\" said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \"The unicorn\\'s dead, Hagrid, it\\'s in that clearing back there.\"', '\"This is where I leave you,\" Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \"You are safe now.\"', 'Harry slid off his back.', '\"Good luck, Harry Potter,\" said Firenze. \"The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\"', 'He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.', 'Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.', \"Harry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.\", '\"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort\\'s waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich....\"', '\"Stop saying the name!\" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.', \"Harry wasn't listening.\", '\"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn\\'t have done so.... Bane was furious...', 'he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen.... They must show that Voldemort\\'s coming back.... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me....

Well, I suppose Bane\\'ll be happy.\"', 'Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.', '\"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore\\'s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won\\'t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right?

They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night's surprises weren't over.\", 'When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it: Just in case.', 'In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.', 'It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.', 'They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox -- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.', \"Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.\", \"Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.\", \"Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest.\", '\"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn\\'t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\"', 'Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \"No more studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we\\'ve got a week before we find out how badly we\\'ve done, there\\'s no need to worry yet.\"', 'Harry was rubbing his forehead.', '\"I wish I knew what this means!\" he burst out angrily. \"My scar keeps hurting -- it\\'s happened before, but never as often as this.\"', '\"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested.', '\"I\\'m not ill,\" said Harry. \"I think it\\'s a warning... it means danger\\'s coming....\"', \"Ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot.\", '\"Harry, relax, Hermione\\'s right, the Stone\\'s safe as long as Dumbledore\\'s around. Anyway, we\\'ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he\\'s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\"', 'Harry nodded, but he couldn\\'t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he\\'d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \"That\\'s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we\\'d done that one.\"', \"Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore.\", 'Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but -- Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.', '\"Where\\'re you going?\" said Ron sleepily.', '\"I\\'ve just thought of something,\" said Harry. He had turned white.', '\"We\\'ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\"', '\"Why?\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.', '\"Don\\'t you think it\\'s a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket?

Got time fer a drink?\"', '\"Yes, please,\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off.', '\"No, we\\'re in a hurry. Hagrid, I\\'ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\"', '\"Dunno,\" said Hagrid casually, \"he wouldn\\' take his cloak off.\"', 'He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.', '\"It\\'s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o\\' funny folk in the Hog\\'s Head -- that\\'s the pub down in the village.

Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\"', '\"Mighta come up,\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.', '\"Yeah... he asked what I did, an\\' I told him I was gamekeeper here....', \"He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told him... an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon... an' then...

Harry and Ron wheeled round.', 'Snape was standing there.', '\"Good afternoon,\" he said smoothly.', 'They stared at him.', '\"You shouldn\\'t be inside on a day like this,\" he said, with an odd, twisted smile.', '\"We were --\" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.', '\"You want to be more careful,\" said Snape. \"Hanging around like this, people will think you\\'re up to something. And Gryffindor really can\\'t afford to lose any more points, can it?\"', 'Harry flushed.

Good day to you.\"', 'He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.', 'Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.', '\"Right, here\\'s what we\\'ve got to do,\" he whispered urgently. \"One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you\\'d better do that.\"', '\"Why me?\"', '\"It\\'s obvious,\" said Ron. \"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\" He put on a high voice, \"\\'Oh Professor Flitwick, I\\'m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....\\'\\x93', '\"Oh, shut up,\" said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.', '\"And we\\'d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\" Harry told Ron.', '\"Come on.\"', \"But that part of the plan didn't work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\", '\"I suppose you think you\\'re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\" she stormed. \"Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you \\'ve come anywhere near here again, I\\'ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor!

You\\'ll be expelled!\"', '\"SO WHAP\" Harry shouted. \"Don\\'t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort\\'s coming back! Haven\\'t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won\\'t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He\\'ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn\\'t matter anymore, can\\'t you see? D\\'you think he\\'ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I\\'ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it\\'s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I\\'m never going over to the Dark Side! I\\'m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\"', 'He glared at them.', '\"You\\'re right Harry,\" said Hermione in a small voice.', '\"I\\'ll use the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It\\'s just lucky I got it back.\"', '\"But will it cover all three of us?\" said Ron.', '\"All -- all three of us?\"', '\"Oh, come off it, you don\\'t think we\\'d let you go alone?\"', '\"Of course not,\" said Hermione briskly. \"How do you think you\\'d get to the Stone without us? I\\'d better go and took through my books, there might be something useful...\"', '\"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\"', '\"Not if I can help it,\" said Hermione grimly. \"Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They\\'re not throwing me out after that.\"', 'After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.', \"Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.\", 'Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.', '\"Better get the cloak,\" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn\\'t feel much like singing.', 'He ran back down to the common room.', '\"We\\'d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --\"', '\"What are you doing?\" said a voice from the corner of the room.

Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.', '\"If you want to go back, I won\\'t blame you,\" he said. \"You can take the cloak, I won\\'t need it now.\"', '\"Don\\'t be stupid,\" said Ron.', '\"We\\'re coming,\" said Hermione.', 'Harry pushed the door open.', \"As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears.

It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\", '\"Keep playing,\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog\\'s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. \"I think we\\'ll be able to pull the door open,\" said Ron, peering over the dog\\'s back. \"Want to go first, Hermione?\"', '\"No, I don\\'t!\"', '\"All right.\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog\\'s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.', '\"What can you see?\" Hermione said anxiously.', '\"Nothing -- just black -- there\\'s no way of climbing down, we\\'ll just have to drop.\"', 'Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.', '\"You want to go first? Are you sure?\" said Ron. \"I don\\'t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\"', \"Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.\", 'Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.', 'He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \"If anything happens to me, don\\'t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\"', '\"Right,\" said Ron.', '\"See you in a minute, I hope...', 'And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and -- FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.', '\"It\\'s okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \"it\\'s a soft landing, you can jump!\"', 'Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.', '\"What\\'s this stuff?\" were his first words.', '\"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it\\'s here to break the fall.', 'Come on, Hermione!\"', \"The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped.

She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.', 'Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.', '\"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is -- it\\'s Devil\\'s Snare!\"', '\"Oh, I\\'m so glad we know what it\\'s called, that\\'s a great help,\" snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \"Shut up, I\\'m trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione.', '\"Well, hurry up, I can\\'t breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.', '\"Devil\\'s Snare, Devil\\'s Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it likes the dark and the damp \"So light a fire!\" Harry choked.', '\"Yes -- of course -- but there\\'s no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her hands.', '\"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\"', '\"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.', 'Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.', '\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.', '\"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn\\'t lose his head in a crisis -- \\'there\\'s no wood,\\' honestly.\"', '\"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.', \"All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank.

A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.', '\"Do you think it\\'s a ghost?\"', '\"I don\\'t know... sounds like wings to me.\"', '\"There\\'s light ahead -- I can see something moving.\"', 'They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.', '\"Do you think they\\'ll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron.', '\"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don\\'t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there\\'s no other choice... I\\'ll run.\"', 'He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened.

They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\", '\"Now what?\" said Ron.', '\"These birds... they can\\'t be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione.', 'They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering? \"They\\'re not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They\\'re keys! Winged keys -- look carefully. So that must mean...\" he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"... yes -- look! Broomsticks! We\\'ve got to catch the key to the door!\"', '\"But there are hundreds of them!\"', 'Ron examined the lock on the door.', '\"We\\'re looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the handle.\"', 'They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.', \"Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.\", '\"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one -- there -- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\"', 'Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.', '\"We\\'ve got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I\\'ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\"', \"Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber.\", 'They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.', '\"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.', \"The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.\", 'They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces.', '\"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered.', '\"It\\'s obvious, isn\\'t it?\" said Ron. \"We\\'ve got to play our way across the room.\"', 'Behind the white pieces they could see another door.', '\"How?\" said Hermione nervously.', '\"I think,\" said Ron, \"we\\'re going to have to be chessmen.\"', \"He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life.

Ron turned to the other two.', '\"This needs thinking about he said. I suppose we\\'ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces....\"', 'Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \"Now, don\\'t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess --\"', '\"We\\'re not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\"', '\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90 next to him instead of that castle.\"', '\"What about you?\"', '\"I\\'m going to be a knight,\" said Ron.', 'The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.', '\"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board.', '\"Yes... look...\"', 'A white pawn had moved forward two squares.', 'Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry\\'s knees were trembling. What if they lost? \"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right.\"', 'Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.', '\"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken. \"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\"', 'Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.', 'Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall.', 'Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.', '\"We\\'re nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly. \"Let me think let me think...\"', 'The white queen turned her blank face toward him.', '\"Yes...\" said Ron softly, \"It\\'s the only way... I\\'ve got to be taken.\"', '\"NOF Harry and Hermione shouted.', '\"That\\'s chess!\" snapped Ron. \"You\\'ve got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she\\'ll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\"', '\"But --\"', '\"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\"', '\"Ron --\"', '\"Look, if you don\\'t hurry up, he\\'ll already have the Stone!\"', 'There was no alternative.', '\"Ready?\" Ron called, his face pale but determined. \"Here I go - now, don\\'t hang around once you\\'ve won.\"', \"He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor - Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out.\", 'Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.', \"The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.\", '\"What if he\\'s --?\"', '\"He\\'ll be all right,\" said Harry, trying to convince himself. \"What do you reckon\\'s next?\"', '\"We\\'ve had Sprout\\'s, that was the Devil\\'s Snare; Flitwick must\\'ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell\\'s spell, and Snape\\'s.\"', 'They had reached another door.', '\"All right?\" Harry whispered.', '\"Go on.\"', 'Harry pushed it open.', 'A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.', '\"I\\'m glad we didn\\'t have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \"Come on, I can\\'t breathe.\"', 'He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.', '\"Snape\\'s,\" said Harry. \"What do we have to do?\"', \"They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward.\", 'They were trapped.', '\"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, which ever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.', \"Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine's left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\", 'Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.', '\"Brilliant,\" said Hermione. \"This isn\\'t magic -- it\\'s logic -- a puzzle.', 'A lot of the greatest wizards haven\\'t got an ounce of logic, they\\'d be stuck in here forever.\"', '\"But so will we, won\\'t we?\" \"Of course not,\" said Hermione. \"Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\"', '\"But how do we know which to drink?\"', '\"Give me a minute.\"', 'Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.', '\"Got it,\" she said. \"The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire -- toward the Stone.\"', 'Harry looked at the tiny bottle.', '\"There\\'s only enough there for one of us,\" he said. \"That\\'s hardly one swallow.\"', 'They looked at each other.', '\"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\"', 'Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.', '\"You drink that,\" said Harry. \"No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying- key room, they\\'ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I\\'m no match for him, really.\"', '\"But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who\\'s with him?\"', '\"Well -- I was lucky once, wasn\\'t I?\" said Harry, pointing at his scar.', '\"I might get lucky again.\"', \"Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.\", '\"Hermione!\"', '\"Harry -- you\\'re a great wizard, you know.\"', '\"I\\'m not as good as you,\" said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.', '\"Me!\" said Hermione. \"Books! And cleverness! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!\"', '\"You drink first,\" said Harry. \"You are sure which is which, aren\\'t you?\"', '\"Positive,\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.', '\"It\\'s not poison?\" said Harry anxiously.', '\"No -- but it\\'s like ice.\"', '\"Quick, go, before it wears off.\"', '\"Good luck -- take care.\"', '\"GO!\"', 'Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.', 'Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames.', '\"Here I come,\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.', \"It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel them -- for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire -- then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.\", \"There was already someone there -- but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even Voldemort.\", '\"You!\" gasped Harry.', \"Quirrell smiled. His face wasn't twitching at all.\", '\"Me,\" he said calmly. \"I wondered whether I\\'d be meeting you here, Potter.\"', '\"But I thought -- Snape --\"', '\"Severus?\" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn\\'t his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. \"Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn\\'t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\"', \"Harry couldn't take it in. This couldn't be true, it couldn't.\", '\"But Snape tried to kill me!\"', '\"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I\\'d have got you off that broom. I\\'d have managed it before then if Snape hadn\\'t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.\"', '\"Snape was trying to save me?\"', '\"Of course,\" said Quirrell coolly. \"\\\\Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn\\'t do it again. Funny, really... he needn\\'t have bothered. I couldn\\'t do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular...', 'and what a waste of time, when after all that, I\\'m going to kill you tonight.\"', 'Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.', '\"You\\'re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you\\'d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.\"', '\"You let the troll in?\"', '\"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn\\'t even manage to bite Snape\\'s leg off properly.', '\"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.', 'It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.', 'It was the Mirror of Erised.', '\"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\" Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. \"Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this... but he\\'s in London... I\\'ll be far away by the time he gets back....\"', 'All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.', '\"I saw you and Snape in the forest --\" he blurted out.', '\"Yes,\" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. \"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I\\'d got.', 'He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me - as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side....\"', 'Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.', '\"I see the Stone... I\\'m presenting it to my master... but where is it?\"', \"Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\", '\"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\"', '\"Oh, he does,\" said Quirrell casually, \"heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn\\'t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.\"', '\"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was threatening you....\"', \"For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face.\", '\"Sometimes,\" he said, \"I find it hard to follow my master\\'s instructions -- he is a great wizard and I am weak --\"', '\"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\" Harry gasped.', '\"He is with me wherever I go,\" said Quirrell quietly. \"I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\"', 'Quirrell shivered suddenly. \"He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me....\"', \"Quirrell's voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley -how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\", 'Quirrell cursed under his breath.', '\"I don\\'t understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?\"', \"Harry's mind was racing.\", 'What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myseff finding it -- which means I\\'ll see where it\\'s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I\\'m up to? He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself. \"What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\"', 'And to Harry\\'s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself \"Use the boy... Use the boy...\"', 'Quirrell rounded on Harry.', '\"Yes -- Potter -- come here.\"', 'He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.', '\"Come here,\" Quirrell repeated. \"Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.\"', 'Harry walked toward him.', \"I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that's all.\", \"Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.\", \"He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket -- and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow -- incredibly -- he'd gotten the Stone.\", '\"Well?\" said Quirrell impatiently. \"What do you see?\"', 'Harry screwed up his courage.', '\"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\" he invented. \"I -- I\\'ve won the house cup for Gryffindor.\"', 'Quirrell cursed again.', '\"Get out of the way,\" he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer\\'s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it? But he hadn\\'t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn\\'t moving his lips.', '\"He lies... He lies...\"', '\"Potter, come back here!\" Quirrell shouted. \"Tell me the truth! What did you just see?\"', 'The high voice spoke again.', '\"Let me speak to him... face-to-face...\"', '\"Master, you are not strong enough!\"', '\"I have strength enough... for this....\"', \"Harry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn't move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell's head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.\", \"Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.\", '\"Harry Potter...\" it whispered.', \"Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move.\", '\"See what I have become?\" the face said. \"Mere shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can share another\\'s body... but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own.... Now... why don\\'t you give me that Stone in your pocket?\"', \"So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry's legs. He stumbled backward.\", '\"Don\\'t be a fool,\" snarled the face. \"Better save your own life and join me... or you\\'ll meet the same end as your parents.... They died begging me for mercy...\"', '\"LIAR!\" Harry shouted suddenly.', 'Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling.', '\"How touching...\" it hissed. \"I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your parents were brave.... I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight... but your mother needn\\'t have died... she was trying to protect you.... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.\"', '\"NEVER!\"', 'Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \"SEIZE HIM!\"', \"and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers -- they were blistering before his eyes.\", '\"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!\" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet\\' landing on top of him, both hands around Harry\\'s neck -- Harry\\'s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.', '\"Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!\"', 'And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.', '\"Then kill him, fool, and be done!\" screeched Voldemort.', 'Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell\\'s face -- \"AAAARGH!\"', \"Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.\", 'Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off -- the pain in Harry\\'s head was building -- he couldn\\'t see -- he could only hear Quirrell\\'s terrible shrieks and Voldemort\\'s yells of, \"KILL HIM! KILL HIM!\" and other voices, maybe in Harry\\'s own head, crying, \"Harry! Harry!\"', \"He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down... down...\", 'Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.', \"He blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.\", 'He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.', '\"Good afternoon, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \"Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He\\'s got the Stone! Sir, quick --\"', '\"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\" said Dumbledore. \"Quirrell does not have the Stone.\"', '\"Then who does? Sir, I --\"', '\"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.', 'Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.', '\"Tokens from your friends and admirers,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\"', '\"How long have I been in here?\"', '\"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\"', '\"But sit, the Stone I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.', '\"You got there? You got Hermione\\'s owl?\"', '\"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\"', '\"It was you.\"', '\"I feared I might be too late.\"', '\"You nearly were, I couldn\\'t have kept him off the Stone much longer --\"', '\"Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.\"', '\"Destroyed?\" said Harry blankly. \"But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel --\"', '\"Oh, you know about Nicolas?\" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted.', '\"You did do the thing properly, didn\\'t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it\\'s all for the best.\"', '\"But that means he and his wife will die, won\\'t they?\"', '\"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.\"', \"Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face.\", '\"To one as young as you, I\\'m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\" Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.', '\"Sir?\" said Harry. \"I\\'ve been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone\\'s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --\"', '\"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\"', '\"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort\\'s going to try other ways of coming back, isn\\'t he? I mean, he hasn\\'t gone, has he?\"', '\"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.', 'He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.\"', 'Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, \"Sir, there are some other things I\\'d like to know, if you can tell me... things I want to know the truth about....\"', '\"The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you\\'ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\"', '\"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?\"', 'Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.', '\"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry.', 'When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are ready, you will know.\"', 'And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.', '\"But why couldn\\'t Quirrell touch me?\"', '\"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\\'t realize that love as powerful as your mother\\'s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\"', 'Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, \"And the invisibility cloak - do you know who sent it to me?\"', '\"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\" Dumbledore\\'s eyes twinkled. \"Useful things... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\"', '\"And there\\'s something else...\"', '\"Fire away.\"', '\"Quirrell said Snape --\"', '\"Professor Snape, Harry.\" \"Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?\"', '\"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\"', '\"What?\"', '\"He saved his life.\"', '\"What?\"', '\"Yes...\" said Dumbledore dreamily. \"Funny, the way people\\'s minds work, isn\\'t it? Professor Snape couldn\\'t bear being in your father\\'s debt....', 'I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father\\'s memory in peace....\"', 'Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.', '\"And sir, there\\'s one more thing...\"', '\"Just the one?\"', '\"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\"', '\"Ah, now, I\\'m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that\\'s saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be able to get it, otherwise they\\'d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes.... Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since then I\\'m afraid I\\'ve rather lost my liking for them -- but I think I\\'ll be safe with a nice toffee, don\\'t you?\"', 'He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, \"Alas! Ear wax!\"', 'Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.', '\"Just five minutes,\" Harry pleaded.', '\"Absolutely not.\"', '\"You let Professor Dumbledore in...\"', '\"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.\"', '\"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey...\"', '\"Oh, very well,\" she said. \"But five minutes only.\"', 'And she let Ron and Hermione in.', '\"Harry!\"', 'Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.', '\"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried --\"', '\"The whole school\\'s talking about it,\" said Ron. \"What really happened?\"', \"It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\", '\"So the Stone\\'s gone?\" said Ron finally. \"Flamel\\'s just going to die?\"', '\"That\\'s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- \\'to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.', '\"I always said he was off his rocker,\" said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.', '\"So what happened to you two?\" said Harry.', '\"Well, I got back all right,\" said Hermione. \"I brought Ron round -- that took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he just said, \\'Harry\\'s gone after him, hasn\\'t he?\\' and hurtled off to the third floor.\"', '\"D\\'you think he meant you to do it?\" said Ron. \"Sending you your father\\'s cloak and everything?\"', '\"Well, \" Hermione exploded, \"if he did -- I mean to say that\\'s terrible -- you could have been killed.\"', '\"No, it isn\\'t,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He\\'s a funny man, Dumbledore.', 'I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don\\'t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It\\'s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could....\"', '\"Yeah, Dumbledore\\'s off his rocker, all right,\" said Ron proudly.', '\"Listen, you\\'ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course -- you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but the food\\'ll be good.\"', 'At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.', '\"You\\'ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT\" she said firmly.', \"After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\", 'I want to go to the feast,\" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. I can, can\\'t I?\"', '\"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\" she said stiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\\'t realize how risky feasts could be. \"And you have another visitor.\"', '\"Oh, good,\" said Harry. \"Who is it?\"', 'Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.', '\"It\\'s -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!\" he sobbed, his face in his hands.', 'I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn\\'t know, an\\' I told him! Yeh could\\'ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I\\'ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an\\' made ter live as a Muggle!\"', '\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \"Hagrid, he\\'d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we\\'re talking about, he\\'d have found out even if you hadn\\'t told him.\"', '\"Yeh could\\'ve died!\" sobbed Hagrid. \"An\\' don\\' say the name!\"', '\"VOLDEMORT!\" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. \"I\\'ve met him and I\\'m calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it\\'s gone, he can\\'t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I\\'ve got loads....\"', 'Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \"That reminds me. I\\'ve got yeh a present.\"', '\"It\\'s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\" said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. \"Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. \\'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway, got yeh this...\"', 'It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.', '\"Sent owls off ter all yer parents\\' old school friends, askin\\' fer photos... knew yeh didn\\' have any... d\\'yeh like it?\"', \"Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.\", \"Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\", 'When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.', 'Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.', '\"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble you with an old man\\'s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts....', '\"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.\"', 'A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.', 'Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.', '\"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent events must be taken into account.\"', \"The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.\", '\"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last-minute points to dish out.', 'Let me see. Yes...', '\"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley...\"', 'Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.', '\"...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"', 'Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall\\'s giant chess set!\"', 'At last there was silence again.', '\"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"', 'Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves -- they were a hundred points up. \"Third -- to Mr. Harry Potter...\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\"', 'The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points -- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.', 'Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.', '\"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\"', 'Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.', \"Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.\", '\"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we need a little change of decoration.\"', \"He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\", \"It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would never, ever forget tonight.\", \"Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.\", 'And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville\\'s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\"I always hope they\\'ll forget to give us these,\" said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King\\'s Cross Station.', \"It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\", '\"You must come and stay this summer,\" said Ron, \"both of you -- I\\'ll send you an owl.\"', '\"Thanks,\" said Harry, \"I\\'ll need something to look forward to.\" People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called: \"Bye, Harry!\"', '\"See you, Potter!\"', '\"Still famous,\" said Ron, grinning at him.', '\"Not where I\\'m going, I promise you,\" said Harry.', 'He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \"There he is, Mom, there he is, look!\"', \"It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at Ron.\", '\"Harry Potter!\" she squealed. \"Look, Mom! I can see \"Be quiet, Ginny, and it\\'s rude to point.\"', 'Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.', '\"Busy year?\" she said.', '\"Very,\" said Harry. \"Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.\"', '\"Oh, it was nothing, dear.\"', '\"Ready, are you?\"', 'It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.', '\"You must be Harry\\'s family!\" said Mrs. Weasley.', '\"In a manner of speaking,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"Hurry up, boy, we haven\\'t got all day.\" He walked away.', 'Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.', '\"See you over the summer, then.\"', '\"Hope you have -- er -- a good holiday,\" said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.', '\"Oh, I will,\" said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. \"They don\\'t know we\\'re not allowed to use magic at home. I\\'m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer....\"', 'THE END \\r\\naahhaahh hey hey hey']\n",

Rowling\\r\\n(this is BOOK 2 in the Harry Potter series)\\r\\nOriginal Scanned/OCR: Friday, April 07, 2000\\r\\nv1.0\\r\\n(edit where needed, change version number by 0.1)\\r\\nC H A P T E O N E\\r\\nTHE WORST BIRTHDAY\\r\\nNot for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at\\r\\nnumber four, Privet Drive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in\\r\\nthe early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his\\r\\nnephew Harry\\'s room.\\r\\n\"Third time this week!\" he roared across the table. \"If you can\\'t\\r\\ncontrol that owl, it\\'ll have to go!\"\\r\\nHarry tried, yet again, to explain.\\r\\n\"She\\'s bored,\" he said. \"She\\'s used to flying around outside. If I could\\r\\njust let her out at night -\"\\r\\n\"Do I look stupid?\" snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling\\r\\nfrom his bushy mustache. \"I know what\\'ll happen if that owl\\'s let\\r\\nout.\"\\r\\nHe exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.\\r\\nHarry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long,\\r\\nloud belch from the Dursleys\\' son, Dudley.\\r\\n2\\r\\n\"I want more bacon.\"\\r\\n\"There\\'s more in the frying pan, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia,\\r\\nturning misty eyes on her massive son. \"We must build you up while\\r\\nwe\\'ve got the chance .... I don\\'t like the sound of that school food\\r\\n......\\r\\n\"Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,\"\\r\\nsaid Uncle Vernon heartily. \"Dudley gets enough, don\\'t you, son?\"\\r\\nDudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the\\r\\nkitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.\\r\\n\"Pass the frying pan.\"\\r\\n\"You\\'ve forgotten the magic word,\" said Harry irritably.\\r\\nThe effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was\\r\\nincredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that\\r\\nshook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and\\r\\nclapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet,\\r\\nveins throbbing in his temples.\\r\\n\"I meant `please\\'!\" said Harry quickly. \"I didn\\'t mean -\"\\r\\n\"WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,\" thundered his uncle, spraying spit\\r\\nover the table, \"ABOUT SAYING THE `M\\' WORD IN OUR\\r\\nHOUSE?\"\\r\\n\"But I -\"\\r\\n\"HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!\" roared Uncle\\r\\nVernon, pounding the table with his fist.\\r\\n\"I just -\"\\r\\n\"I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF\\r\\nYOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!\"\\r\\nHarry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was\\r\\ntrying to heave Dudley to his feet.\\r\\n3\\r\\n\"All right,\" said Harry, \"all right. . . \"\\r\\nUncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and\\r\\nwatching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.\\r\\nEver since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle\\r\\nVernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any\\r\\nmoment, because Harry Potter wasn\\'t a normal boy. As a matter of\\r\\nfact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.\\r\\nHarry Potter was a wizard - a wizard fresh from his first year at\\r\\nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys\\r\\nwere unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how\\r\\nHarry felt.\\r\\nHe missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant\\r\\nstomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and\\r\\nghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the\\r\\nmail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his\\r\\nfour-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper,\\r\\nHagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and,\\r\\nespecially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world\\r\\n(six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on\\r\\nbroomsticks).\\r\\nAll Harry\\'s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line\\r\\nNimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard\\r\\nunder the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home.\\r\\nWhat did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House\\r\\nQuidditch team because he hadn\\'t practiced all summer? What was it\\r\\nto the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his\\r\\nhomework done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles\\r\\n(not a drop of magical blood in their veins),\\r\\nand as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was\\r\\na matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked\\r\\nHarry\\'s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying\\r\\nmessages to anyone in the wizarding world.\\r\\nHarry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was\\r\\nlarge and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia\\r\\n4\\r\\nwas horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry,\\r\\non the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and\\r\\njet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on\\r\\nhis forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.\\r\\nIt was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a\\r\\nwizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry\\'s very mysterious past, of\\r\\nthe reason he had been left on the Dursleys\\' doorstep eleven years\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\nAt the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from\\r\\nthe greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name\\r\\nmost witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry\\'s parents had\\r\\ndied in Voldemort\\'s attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning\\r\\nscar, and somehow - nobody understood why Voldemort\\'s powers had\\r\\nbeen destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.\\r\\nSo Harry had been brought up by his dead mother\\'s sister and her\\r\\nhusband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never\\r\\nunderstanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning\\r\\nto, believing the Dursleys\\' story that he had got his scar in the car\\r\\ncrash that had killed his parents.\\r\\nAnd then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry,\\r\\nand the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at\\r\\nwizard school, where he and his scar were famous ... but now the\\r\\nschool year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the\\r\\nsummer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something\\r\\nsmelly.\\r\\nThe Dursleys hadn\\'t even remembered that today happened to be\\r\\nHarry\\'s twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn\\'t been high; they\\'d\\r\\nnever given him a real present, let alone a cake - but to ignore it\\r\\ncompletely ...\\r\\nAt that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said,\\r\\n\"Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.\"\\r\\nHarry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.\\r\\n\"This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, \"\\r\\n5\\r\\nsaid Uncle Vernon.\\r\\nHarry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Un\\r\\ncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He\\'d been talk\\r\\ning of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife\\r\\nwere coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge\\r\\norder from him (Uncle Vernon\\'s company made drills).\\r\\n\"I think we should run through the schedule one more time,\" said\\r\\nUncle Vernon. \"We should all be in position at eight o\\'clock. Petunia,\\r\\nyou will be -?\"\\r\\n\"In the lounge,\" said Aunt Petunia promptly, \"waiting to welcome them\\r\\ngraciously to our home.\"\\r\\n\"Good, good. And Dudley?\"\\r\\n\"I\\'ll be waiting to open the door.\" Dudley put on a foul, simpering\\r\\nsmile. \"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\"\\r\\n\"They\\'ll love him!\" cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.\\r\\n\"Excellent, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry.\\r\\n\"And you?\"\\r\\n\"I\\'ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I\\'m not\\r\\nthere,\" said Harry tonelessly.\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" said Uncle Vernon nastily. \"I will lead them into the\\r\\nlounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them -drinks. At eightfifteen\\r\\n-\"\\r\\n\"I\\'ll announce dinner,\" said Aunt Petunia.\\r\\n\"And, Dudley, you\\'ll say -\"\\r\\n\"May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?\" said\\r\\nDudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.\\r\\n\"My perfect little gentleman!\" sniffed Aunt Petunia.\\r\\n\"And you?\" said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.\\r\\n6\\r\\n\"I\\'ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I\\'m not there,\"\\r\\nsaid Harry dully.\\r\\n\"Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at\\r\\ndinner. Petunia, any ideas?\"\\r\\n\"Vernon tells me you\\'re a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason.... Do tell me\\r\\nwhere you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason ......\\r\\n\"Perfect. . . Dudley?\"\\r\\n\"How about -\\'We had to write an essay about our hero at school,\\r\\nMr. Mason, and I wrote about you.\"\\'\\r\\nThis was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia\\r\\nburst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the\\r\\ntable so they wouldn\\'t see him laughing.\\r\\n\"And you, boy?\"\\r\\nHarry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.\\r\\n\"I\\'ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I\\'m not there,\"\\r\\nhe said.\\r\\n\"Too right, you will,\" said Uncle Vernon forcefully. \"The Ma\\r\\nsons don\\'t know anything about you and it\\'s going to stay that way.\\r\\nWhen dinner\\'s over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for\\r\\ncoffee, Petunia, and I\\'ll bring the subject around to drills. With any\\r\\nluck, I\\'ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten.\\r\\nbe shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time to\\r\\nmorrow.\\r\\nHarry couldn\\'t feel too excited about this. He didn\\'t think the\\r\\nDursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on\\r\\nPrivet Drive.\\r\\n\"Right - I\\'m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for\\r\\nDudley and me. And you,\" he snarled at Harry. \"You stay out of\\r\\nyour aunt\\'s way while she\\'s cleaning.\"\\r\\nHarry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day.\\r\\nHe crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang\\r\\nunder his breath:\\r\\n7\\r\\n\"Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me. . .\\r\\nNo cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening\\r\\npretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had\\r\\nnever felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more\\r\\neven than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron\\r\\nWeasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn\\'t seem to be\\r\\nmissing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer,\\r\\neven though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and\\r\\nstay.\\r\\nCountless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking\\r\\nHedwig\\'s cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione\\r\\nwith a letter, but it wasn\\'t worth the risk. Underage wizards weren\\'t\\r\\nallowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn\\'t told the\\r\\nDursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them\\r\\nall into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the\\r\\ncupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first\\r\\ncouple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words\\r\\nunder his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast\\r\\nas his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and\\r\\nHermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that\\r\\neven taunting Dudley had lost its appeal - and now Ron and Hermione\\r\\nhad forgotten his birthday.\\r\\nWhat wouldn\\'t he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any\\r\\nwitch or wizard? He\\'d almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy,\\r\\nDraco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn\\'t all been a dream ....\\r\\nNot that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of\\r\\nlast term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord\\r\\nVoldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but\\r\\nhe was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power.\\r\\nHarry had slipped through Voldemort\\'s clutches for a second time, but\\r\\nit had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept\\r\\nwaking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where\\r\\nVoldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes\\r\\nHarry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been\\r\\nstaring absent-mindedly into the hedge - and the hedge was staring back.\\r\\nTwo enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.\\r\\nHarry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the\\r\\n8\\r\\nlawn.\\r\\n\"I know what day it is,\" sang Dudley, waddling toward him.\\r\\nThe huge eyes blinked and vanished.\\r\\n\"What?\" said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had\\r\\nbeen.\\r\\n\"I know what day it is,\" Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.\\r\\n\"Well done,\" said Harry. \"So you\\'ve finally learned the days of the\\r\\nweek.\"\\r\\n\"Today\\'s your birthday,\" sneered Dudley. \"How come you haven\\'t got\\r\\nany cards? Haven\\'t you even got friends at that freak place?\"\\r\\n\"Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,\" said\\r\\nHarry coolly.\\r\\nDudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat\\r\\nbottom.\\r\\n\"Why\\'re you staring at the hedge?\" he said suspiciously.\\r\\n\" I , m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on\\r\\nfire,\" said Harry.\\r\\nDudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.\\r\\n\"You c-can\\'t - Dad told you you\\'re not to do m-magic - he said he\\'ll\\r\\nchuck you out of the house - and you haven\\'t got anywhere else to go -\\r\\nyou haven\\'t got any friends to take you -\"\\r\\n\"Jiggery pokery!\" said Harry in a fierce voice. \"Hocus pocus squiggly\\r\\nwiggly -\"\\r\\n\"MUUUUUUM!\" howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed\\r\\nback toward the house. \"MUUUUM! He\\'s doing you know what!\"\\r\\nHarry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor\\r\\nthe hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn\\'t really\\r\\n9\\r\\ndone magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his\\r\\nhead with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with\\r\\nthe promise he wouldn\\'t eat again until he\\'d finished.\\r\\nWhile Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry\\r\\ncleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the\\r\\nflowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden\\r\\nbench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry\\r\\nknew he shouldn\\'t have risen to Dudley\\'s bait, but Dudley had said\\r\\nthe very thing Harry had been thinking himself... maybe he didn\\'t have\\r\\nany friends at Hogwarts ....\\r\\nWish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he\\r\\nspread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running\\r\\ndown his face.\\r\\nIt was half past seven ,in the evening when at last, exhausted, he\\r\\nheard Aunt Petunia calling him.\\r\\n\"Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!\"\\r\\nHarry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of\\r\\nthe fridge stood tonight\\'s pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream\\r\\nand sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.\\r\\n\"Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!\" snapped Aunt Petunia,\\r\\npointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen\\r\\ntable. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.\\r\\nHarry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The\\r\\nmoment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate.\\r\\n\"Upstairs! Hurry!\"\\r\\nAs he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a\\r\\nglimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jack\\r\\nets. He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the door\\r\\nbell rang and Uncle Vernon\\'s furious face appeared at the foot of\\r\\nthe stairs.\\r\\n\"Remember, boy - one sound -\"\\r\\nHarry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closed\\r\\nthe door, and turned to collapse on his bed.\\r\\nThe trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.\\r\\n10\\r\\nC H-H A P T E RR T W o\\r\\nI\\r\\nDOBBY\\'S WARNING\\r\\narry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The little\\r\\ncreature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the\\r\\nsize of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been\\r\\nwatching him out of the garden hedge that morning.\\r\\nAs they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley\\'s voice from the hall.\\r\\n\"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\"\\r\\nThe creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its\\r\\nlong, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing\\r\\nwhat looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes.\\r\\n\"Er - hello,\" said Harry nervously.\\r\\n\"Harry Potter!\" said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was\\r\\nsure would carry down the stairs. \"So long has Dobby wanted to meet\\r\\nyou, sir ... Such an honor it is . . . .\"\\r\\n\"Th-thank you,\" said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his\\r\\ndesk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. He\\r\\nwanted to ask, \"What are you?\" but thought it would sound too rude,\\r\\nso instead he said, \"Who are you?\"\\r\\n\"Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,\" said the creature.\\r\\n\"Oh - really?\" said Harry. \"Er - I don\\'t want to be rude or anything,\\r\\nbut - this isn\\'t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my\\r\\nbedroom.\"\\r\\nAunt Petunias high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elf\\r\\nhung his head.\\r\\n\"Not that I\\'m not pleased to meet you,\" said Harry quickly, \"but, er,\\r\\nis there any particular reason you\\'re here?\"\\r\\n11\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, sir,\" said Dobby earnestly. \"Dobby has come to tell you,\\r\\nsir ... it is difficult, sir ... Dobby wonders where to begin . . . .\"\\r\\n\"Sit down,\" said Harry politely, pointing at the bed.\\r\\nTo his horror, the elf burst into tears - very noisy tears.\\r\\n\"S-sit down!\" he wailed. \"Never ... never ever. . . \"\\r\\nHarry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" he whispered, \"I didn\\'t mean to offend you or anything -\"\\r\\n\"Offend Dobby!\" choked the elf. \"Dobby has never been asked to sit\\r\\ndown by a wizard - like an equal-\"\\r\\nHarry, trying to say \"Shh!\" and look comforting at the same time,\\r\\nushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, looking\\r\\nlike a large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to control himself,\\r\\nand sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery\\r\\nadoration.\\r\\n\"You can\\'t have met many decent wizards,\" said Harry, trying to\\r\\ncheer him up.\\r\\nDobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and\\r\\nstarted banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, \"Bad\\r\\nDobby! Bad Dobby!\"\\r\\n\"Don\\'t - what are you doing?\" Harry hissed, springing up and pulling\\r\\nDobby back onto the bed - Hedwig had woken up with a\\r\\nparticularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the\\r\\nbars of her cage.\\r\\n\"Dobby had to punish himself, sir,\" said the elf, who had gone slightly\\r\\ncross-eyed. \"Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir . . . .\"\\r\\n\"Your family?\"\\r\\n\"The wizard family Dobby serves, sir... DOBBY\\'S is a houseelf -\\r\\nbound to serve one house and one family forever . .....\\r\\n12\\r\\n\"Do they know you\\'re here?\" asked Harry curiously.\\r\\nDobby shuddered.\\r\\n\"Oh, no, sir, no ... Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously\\r\\nfor coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the\\r\\noven door for this. If they ever knew, sir _\"\\r\\n\"But won\\'t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?\"\\r\\n\"Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for\\r\\nsomething, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they\\r\\nreminds me to do extra punishments ......\\r\\n\"But why don\\'t you leave? Escape?\"\\r\\n\"A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set\\r\\nDobby free ... Dobby will serve the family until he dies, sir . . . .\"\\r\\nHarry stared.\\r\\n\"And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,\"\\r\\nhe said. \"This makes the Dursleys sound almost human. Can\\'t anyone\\r\\nhelp you? Can\\'t I?\"\\r\\nAlmost at once, Harry wished he hadn\\'t spoken. Dobby dissolved again\\r\\ninto wails of gratitude.\\r\\n\"Please,\" Harry whispered frantically, \"please be quiet. If the Dursleys\\r\\nhear anything, if they know you\\'re here -\"\\r\\n\"Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby ... Dobby has heard of your\\r\\ngreatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew . .....\\r\\nHarry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, \"Whatever\\r\\nyou\\'ve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. I\\'m not even top\\r\\nof my year at Hogwarts; that\\'s Hermione, she -\"\\r\\nBut he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful.\\r\\n13\\r\\n\"I-Tarry Potter is humble and modest,\" said Dobby reverently, his orblike\\r\\neyes aglow. \"Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-\\r\\nMust-Not-Be-Named -\"\\r\\n\"Voldemort?\" said Harry.\\r\\nDobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, \"Ah, speak not\\r\\nthe name, sir! Speak not the name!\"\\r\\n\"Sorry\" said Harry quickly. \"I know lots of people don\\'t like it. My\\r\\nfriend Ron -\"\\r\\nHe stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.\\r\\nDobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.\\r\\n\\'Dobby heard tell,\" he said hoarsely, \"that Harry Potter met the Dark\\r\\nLord for a second time just weeks ago ... that Harry Potter escaped\\r\\nYet again. \"\\r\\nHarry nodded and Dobby\\'s eyes suddenly shone with tears.\\r\\n,Ah, sir,\" he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby\\r\\npillowcase he was wearing. \"Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has\\r\\nbraved so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect\\r\\nHarry Potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in\\r\\nthe oven door later... Harry Potter must notgo back to Hogwarts.\"\\r\\nThere was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks\\r\\nfrom downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon\\'s voice.\\r\\n\"W-what?\" Harry stammered. \"But I\\'ve got to go back - term starts\\r\\non September first. It\\'s all that\\'s keeping me going. You don\\'t know\\r\\nwhat it\\'s like here. I don\\'t belong here. I belong in your world - at\\r\\nHogwarts.\"\\r\\n\"No, no, no,\" squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears\\r\\nflapped. \"Harry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great,\\r\\ntoo good, to lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be\\r\\nin mortal danger.\"\\r\\n14\\r\\n\"Why?\" said Harry in surprise.\\r\\n\"There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things\\r\\nhappen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,\"\\r\\nwhispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over. \"Dobby has known it\\r\\nfor months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is too\\r\\nimportant, sir!\"\\r\\n\"What terrible things?\" said Harry at once. \"Who\\'s plotting them?\"\\r\\nDobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head\\r\\nfrantically against the wall.\\r\\n\"All right!\" cried Harry, grabbing the elf\\'s arm to stop him. \"You can\\'t\\r\\ntell me. I understand. But why are you warning me?\" A sudden,\\r\\nunpleasant thought struck him. \"Hang on - this hasn\\'t got anything to\\r\\ndo with Vol- - sorry - with You-Know-Who, has it?\\r\\nYou could just shake or nod,\" he added hastily as Dobby\\'s head\\r\\ntilted worryingly close to the wall again.\\r\\nSlowly, Dobby shook his head.\\r\\n\"Not -not He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir =\\'\\r\\nBut Dobby\\'s eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give\\r\\nHarry a hint. Harry, however, was completely lost.\\r\\n\"He hasn\\'t got a brother, has he?\"\\r\\nDobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.\\r\\n\"Well then, I can\\'t think who else would have a chance of making\\r\\nhorrible things happen at Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I mean, there\\'s\\r\\nDumbledore, for one thing - you know who Dumbledore is, don\\'t\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\nDobby bowed his head.\\r\\n\"Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever\\r\\nhad. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore\\'s powers\\r\\nrival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his\\r\\n15\\r\\nstrength. But, sir\" - Dobby\\'s voice dropped to an urgent whisper -\\r\\n\"there are powers Dumbledore doesn\\'t ... powers no decent wizard.\\r\\n. .\"\\r\\nAnd before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed,\\r\\nseized Harry\\'s desk lamp, and started beating himself around the\\r\\nhead with earsplitting yelps.\\r\\nA sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart\\r\\nthudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling,\\r\\n\"Dudley must have left his television on again, the little tyke!\"\\r\\n\"Quick! In the closet!\" hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting the\\r\\ndoor, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned.\\r\\n\"What - the - devil - are - you - doing?\" said Uncle Vernon through\\r\\ngritted teeth, his face horribly close to Harry\\'s. \"You\\'ve just ruined the\\r\\npunch line of my Japanese golfer joke .... One more sound and you\\'ll\\r\\nwish you\\'d never been born, boy!\"\\r\\nHe stomped flat-footed from the room.\\r\\nShaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet.\\r\\n\"See what it\\'s like here?\" he said. \"See why I\\'ve got to go back to\\r\\nHogwarts? It\\'s the only place I\\'ve got -well, I think I\\'ve got friends. \"\\r\\n\"Friends who don\\'t even write to Harry Potter?\" said Dobby slyly.\\r\\n\"I expect they\\'ve just been - wait a minute,\" said Harry, frowning.\\r\\n\"How do you know my friends haven\\'t been writing to me?\"\\r\\nDobby shuffled his feet.\\r\\n\"Harry Potter mustn\\'t be angry with Dobby. Dobby did it for the best -\\r\\n\"\\r\\n\"Have you been stopping my letters?\"\\r\\n\"Dobby has them here, sir,\" said the elf. Stepping nimbly out of Harry\\'s\\r\\nreach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the\\r\\npillowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out Hermione\\'s neat\\r\\n16\\r\\nwriting, Ron\\'s untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though\\r\\nit was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid.\\r\\nDobby blinked anxiously up at Harry.\\r\\n\"Harry Potter mustn\\'t be angry... Dobby hoped ... if Harry Potter\\r\\nthought his friends had forgotten him ... Harry Potter might not want to\\r\\ngo back to school, sir . .....\\r\\nHarry wasn\\'t listening. He made a grab for the letters, but Dobby\\r\\njumped out of reach.\\r\\n\"Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his word\\r\\nthat he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you must\\r\\nnot face! Say you won\\'t go back, sir!\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry angrily. \"Give me my friends\\' letters!\"\\r\\n\"Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,\" said the elf sadly.\\r\\nBefore Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the bedroom door,\\r\\npulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs.\\r\\nMouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying not to\\r\\nmake a sound. He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the\\r\\nhall carpet, looking around for Dobby. From the dining room he\\r\\nheard Uncle Vernon saying, \". . . tell Petunia that very funny story\\r\\nabout those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. She\\'s been dying to\\r\\nhear. . . \"\\r\\nHarry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear.\\r\\nAunt Petunia\\'s masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and\\r\\nsugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. On top of a\\r\\ncupboard in the corner crouched Dobby.\\r\\n\"No,\" croaked Harry. \"Please ... they\\'ll kill me ......\\r\\n\"Harry Potter must say he\\'s not going back to school -\"\\r\\n\"Dobby ... please ...\\r\\n17\\r\\n\"Say it, sir -\"\\r\\n\"I can\\'t -\"\\r\\nDobby gave him a tragic look.\\r\\n\"Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter\\'s own good.\"\\r\\nThe pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. Cream\\r\\nsplattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a crack\\r\\nlike a whip, Dobby vanished.\\r\\nThere were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon\\r\\nburst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head\\r\\nto foot in Aunt Petunias pudding.\\r\\nAt first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the\\r\\nwhole thing over. (\"Just our nephew - very disturbed meeting strangers\\r\\nupsets him, so we kept him upstairs) He shooed the shocked Masons\\r\\nback into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to within\\r\\nan inch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop.\\r\\nAunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry, still\\r\\nshaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean.\\r\\nUncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal - if it hadn\\'t\\r\\nbeen for the owl.\\r\\nAunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints when\\r\\na huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a\\r\\nletter on Mrs. Mason\\'s head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason\\r\\nscreamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about\\r\\nlunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his\\r\\nwife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask\\r\\nwhether this was their idea of a joke.\\r\\nHarry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as Uncle\\r\\nVernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes.\\r\\n\"Read it!\" he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered.\\r\\n\"Go on - read it!\"\\r\\n18\\r\\nHarry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings.\\r\\nDear Mr. Potter,\\r\\nWe have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your\\r\\nplace of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine.\\r\\nAs you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells\\r\\noutside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to\\r\\nexpulsion from said school (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of\\r\\nUnderage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C).\\r\\nWe would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that\\r\\nrisks notice by members of the non-magical community (Muggles) is\\r\\na serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation\\r\\nof Warlocks\\' Statute of Secrecy.\\r\\nEnjoy your holidays! Yours sincerely,\\r\\nMafalda Hopkirk\\r\\nIMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE\\r\\nMinistry of Magic\\r\\nHarry looked up from the letter and gulped.\\r\\n\"You didn\\'t tell us you weren\\'t allowed to use magic outside school,\"\\r\\nsaid Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. \"For got to\\r\\nmention it .... Slipped your mind, I daresay .....\\r\\nHe was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth\\r\\nbared. \"Well, I\\'ve got news for you, boy . ... I\\'m locking you up ....\\r\\nYou\\'re never going back to that school ... never ... and if you try and\\r\\nmagic yourself out - they\\'ll expel you!\"\\r\\nAnd laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs.\\r\\nUncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning,\\r\\n19\\r\\nhe paid a man to fit bars on Harry\\'s window. He himself fitted a catflap\\r\\nin the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be\\r\\npushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the\\r\\nbathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room\\r\\naround the clock.\\r\\nThree days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, and\\r\\nHarry couldn\\'t see any way out of his situation. He lay on his bed\\r\\nwatching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered\\r\\nmiserably what was going to happen to him.\\r\\nWhat was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts\\r\\nwould expel him for doing it? Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an\\r\\nall-time low. Now that the Dursleys knew they weren\\'t going to wake\\r\\nup as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might have saved\\r\\nHarry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were\\r\\ngoing, he\\'d probably starve to death anyway.\\r\\nThe cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowl\\r\\nof canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with\\r\\nhunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-cold, but\\r\\nhe drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig\\'s\\r\\ncage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into\\r\\nher empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of\\r\\ndeep disgust.\\r\\n\"It\\'s no good turning your beak up at it - that\\'s all we\\'ve got,\" said\\r\\nHarry grimly.\\r\\nHe put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay\\r\\nback down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been\\r\\nbefore the soup.\\r\\nSupposing he was still alive in another four weeks, what would happen\\r\\nif he didn\\'t turn up at Hogwarts? Would someone be sent to see why\\r\\nhe hadn\\'t come back? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let\\r\\nhim go?\\r\\nThe room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind\\r\\nspinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into an\\r\\nuneasy sleep.\\r\\n20\\r\\nHe dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card reading\\r\\nUNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage. People goggled through the bars\\r\\nat him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He saw\\r\\nDobby\\'s face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but Dobby\\r\\ncalled, \"Harry Potter is safe there, sir!\" and vanished. Then the\\r\\nDursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\"Stop it,\" Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head.\\r\\n\"Leave me alone ... cut it out ... I\\'m trying to sleep . . . .\"\\r\\nHe opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through the bars on the\\r\\nwindow. And someone was goggling through the bars at him: a frecklefaced,\\r\\nred-haired, long-nosed someone.\\r\\nRon Weasley was outside Harry\\'s window.\\r\\n21\\r\\nH-H A P T E RR T 11-H RR E E\\r\\nTHE BURROW\\r\\nRon.l\" breathed Harry, creeping to the window and pushing it up so\\r\\nthey could talk through the bars. \"Ron, how did you - What the -?\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit\\r\\nhim. Ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car,\\r\\nwhich was parked in midair Grinning at Harry from the front seats\\r\\nwere Fred and George, Ron\\'s elder twin brothers.\\r\\n\"All right, Harry?\" asked George.\\r\\n\"What\\'s been going on?\" said Ron. \"Why haven\\'t you been answering\\r\\nmy letters? I\\'ve asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad\\r\\ncame home and said you\\'d got an official warning for using magic in\\r\\nfront of Muggles -\"\\r\\n\"It wasn\\'t me - and how did he know?\"\\r\\n\"He works for the Ministry,\" said Ron. \"You know we\\'re not supposed\\r\\nto do spells outside school -\"\\r\\n\"You should talk,\" said Harry, staring at the floating car.\\r\\n\"Oh, this doesn\\'t count,\" said Ron. \"We\\'re only borrowing this. It\\'s\\r\\nDad\\'s, we didn\\'t enchant it. But doing magic in front of those Muggles\\r\\nyou live with -\"\\r\\n\"I told you, I didn\\'t - but it\\'ll take too long to explain now look, can you\\r\\ntell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won\\'t\\r\\nlet me come back, and obviously I can\\'t magic myself out, because the\\r\\nMinistry\\'Il think that\\'s the second spell I\\'ve done in three days, so -\"\\r\\n\"Stop gibbering,\" said Ron. \"We\\'ve come to take you home with us.\"\\r\\n\"But you can\\'t magic me out either -\"\\r\\n22\\r\\n\"We don\\'t need to,\" said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seat\\r\\nand grinning. \"You forget who I\\'ve got with me.\"\\r\\n\"Tie that around the bars,\" said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\n\"If the Dursleys wake up, I\\'m dead,\" said Harry as he tied the rope\\r\\ntightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t worry,\" said Fred, \"and stand back.\"\\r\\nHarry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to\\r\\nhave realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car\\r\\nrevved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the\\r\\nbars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in\\r\\nthe air. Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few\\r\\nfeet above the ground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car.\\r\\nHarry listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the Dursleys\\'\\r\\nbedroom.\\r\\nWhen the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed\\r\\nas close as possible to Harry\\'s window.\\r\\n\"Get in,\" Ron said.\\r\\n\"But all my Hogwarts stuff - my wand - my broomstick -\"\\r\\n\"Where is it?\"\\r\\n\"Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can\\'t get out of this\\r\\nroom -\"\\r\\n\"No problem,\" said George from the front passenger seat. \"Out of\\r\\nthe way, Harry.\"\\r\\nFred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry\\'s\\r\\nroom. You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took an\\r\\nordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock.\\r\\n\"A lot of wizards think it\\'s a waste of time, knowing this sort of\\r\\nMuggle trick,\" said Fred, \"but we feel they\\'re skills worth learning,\\r\\neven if they are a bit slow.\"\\r\\n23\\r\\nThere was a small click and the door swung open.\\r\\n\"So - we\\'ll get your trunk - you grab anything you need from your\\r\\nroom and hand it out to Ron,\" whispered George.\\r\\n\"Watch out for the bottom stair - it creaks,\" Harry whispered back\\r\\nas the twins disappeared onto the dark landing.\\r\\nHarry dashed around his room, collecting his things and passing them\\r\\nout of the window to Ron. Then he went to help Fred and George\\r\\nheave his trunk up the stairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough.\\r\\nAt last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk\\r\\nthrough Harry\\'s room to the open window. Fred climbed back into\\r\\nthe car to pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the\\r\\nbedroom side. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window.\\r\\nUncle Vernon coughed again.\\r\\n\"A bit more,\" panted Fred, who was pulling from inside the car.\\r\\n\"One good push -\"\\r\\nHarry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid\\r\\nout of the window into the back seat of the car.\\r\\n\"Okay, let\\'s go,\" George whispered.\\r\\nBut as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud\\r\\nscreech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder of\\r\\nUncle Vernon\\'s voice.\\r\\n\"THAT RUDDY OWL!\"\\r\\n\"I\\'ve forgotten Hedwig!\"\\r\\nHarry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on - he\\r\\nsnatched up Hedwig\\'s cage, dashed to the window, and passed it\\r\\nout to Ron. He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when\\r\\nUncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open.\\r\\nFor a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway; then\\r\\n24\\r\\nhe let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry, grabbing\\r\\nhim by the ankle.\\r\\nRon, Fred, and George seized Harry\\'s arms and pulled as hard as\\r\\nthey could.\\r\\n\"Petunia!\" roared Uncle Vernon. \"He\\'s getting away! HE\\'S\\r\\nGETTING AWAY!\"\\r\\nBut the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry\\'s leg slid out of\\r\\nUncle Vernon\\'s grasp - Harry was in the car - he\\'d slammed the\\r\\ndoor shut\\r\\n\"Put your foot down, Fred!\" yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly\\r\\ntoward the moon.\\r\\nHarry couldn\\'t believe it - he was free. He rolled down the\\r\\nwindow, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at the\\r\\nshrinking rooftops of Privet Drive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and\\r\\nDudley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry\\'s window.\\r\\n\"See you next summer!\" Harry yelled.\\r\\nThe Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat,\\r\\ngrinning from ear to ear.\\r\\n\"Let Hedwig out,\" he told Ron. \"She can fly behind us. She hasn\\'t had\\r\\na chance to stretch her wings for ages.\"\\r\\nGeorge handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment later, Hedwig soared\\r\\njoyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost.\\r\\n\"So - what\\'s the story, Harry?\" said Ron impatiently. \"What\\'s been\\r\\nhappening?\"\\r\\nHarry told them all about Dobby, the warning he\\'d given Harry and\\r\\nthe fiasco of the violet pudding. There was a long, shocked silence\\r\\nwhen he had finished.\\r\\n\"Very fishy,\" said Fred finally.\\r\\n25\\r\\n\"Definitely dodgy\" agreed George. \"So he wouldn\\'t even tell you who\\'s\\r\\nsupposed to be plotting all this stuff?\"\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think he could,\" said Harry. \"I told you, every time he got close\\r\\nto letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall.\"\\r\\nHe saw Fred and George look at each other.\\r\\n\"What, you think he was lying to me?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Fred, \"put it this way - house-elves have got powerful\\r\\nmagic of their own, but they can\\'t usually use it without their master\\'s\\r\\npermission. I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you com\\r\\ning back to Hogwarts. Someone\\'s idea of a joke. Can you think of\\r\\nanyone at school with a grudge against you?\"\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry and Ron together, instantly.\\r\\n\"Draco Malfoy,\" Harry explained. \"He hates me.\"\\r\\n\"Draco Malfoy?\" said George, turning around. \"Not Lucius Malfoy\\'s\\r\\nson?\"\\r\\n\"Must be, it\\'s not a very common name, is it?\" said Harry.\\r\\nY.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve heard Dad talking about him,\" said George. \"He was a big\\r\\nsupporter of You-Know-Who.\"\\r\\n\"And when You-Know-Who disappeared,\" said Fred, craning\\r\\naround to look at Harry, \"Lucius Malfoy came back saying he\\'d never\\r\\nmeant any of it. Load of dung - Dad reckons he was right in You-\\r\\nKnow-Who\\'s inner circle.\"\\r\\nHarry had heard these rumors about Malfoy\\'s family before, and they\\r\\ndidn\\'t surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look\\r\\nlike a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf said\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\n26\\r\\n\"Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they\\'ll\\r\\nbe rich,\" said Fred.\\r\\n\"Yeah, Mum\\'s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,\"\\r\\nsaid George. \"But all we\\'ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and\\r\\ngnomes all over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors\\r\\nand castles and places like that; you wouldn\\'t catch one in our house .\\r\\n. . .\"\\r\\nHarry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had\\r\\nthe best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he\\r\\ncould just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending\\r\\nthe family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also\\r\\nsounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry\\r\\nbeen stupid to take Dobby seriously?\\r\\n\"I\\'m glad we came to get you, anyway,\" said Ron. \"I was getting\\r\\nreally worried when you didn\\'t answer any of my letters. I thought it\\r\\nwas Errol\\'s fault at first\\r\\n-\"\\r\\n\"Who\\'s Errol?\"\\r\\n\"Our owl. He\\'s ancient. It wouldn\\'t be the first time he\\'d collapsed\\r\\non a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes -\"\\r\\n\"Who?\"\\r\\n\"The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect,\"\\r\\nsaid Fred from the front.\\r\\n\"But Percy wouldn\\'t lend him to me,\" said Ron. \"Said he needed\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\"Percy\\'s been acting very oddly this summer,\" said George,\\r\\nfrowning. \"And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a\\r\\nload of time shut up in his room .... I mean, there\\'s only so many\\r\\ntimes you can polish a prefect badge .... You\\'re driving too far west,\\r\\nFred,\" he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. Fred\\r\\n27\\r\\ntwiddled the steering wheel.\\r\\n\"So, does your dad know you\\'ve got the car?\" said Harry, guessing\\r\\nthe answer.\\r\\n\"Er, no,\" said Ron, \"he had to work tonight. Hopefully we\\'ll be able\\r\\nto get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.\"\\r\\n\"What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway?\"\\r\\n\"He works in the most boring department,\" said Ron. \"The Misuse\\r\\nof Muggle Artifacts Office.\"\\r\\n\"The what?\"\\r\\n\"It\\'s all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made, you\\r\\nknow, in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house. Like,\\r\\nlast year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques\\r\\nshop. This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serve\\r\\nher friends tea in it. It was a nightmare - Dad was working overtime\\r\\nfor weeks.\"\\r\\n\"What happened?\"\\r\\n\"The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place\\r\\nand one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped\\r\\nto his nose. Dad was going frantic - it\\'s only him and an old warlock\\r\\ncalled Perkins in the office -and they had to do Memory Charms and\\r\\nall sorts of stuff to cover it up -\"\\r\\n\"But your dad - this car -\"\\r\\nFred laughed. \"Yeah, Dad\\'s crazy about everything to do with\\r\\nMuggles; our shed\\'s full of Muggle stuff. He takes it apart, puts spells\\r\\non it, and puts it back together again. If he raided our house he\\'d\\r\\nhave to put himself under arrest. It drives Mum mad.\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s the main road,\" said George, peering down through the\\r\\nwindshield. \"We\\'ll be there in ten minutes .... Just as well, it\\'s getting\\r\\nlight . . . .\"\\r\\nA faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east.\\r\\n28\\r\\nFred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark patchwork of\\r\\nfields and clumps of trees.\\r\\n\"We\\'re a little way outside the village,\" said George. \"Ottery St.\\r\\nCatchpole.\"\\r\\nLower and lower went the flying car. The edge of a brilliant red sun\\r\\nwas now gleaming through the trees.\\r\\n\"Touchdown!\" said Fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground.\\r\\nThey had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and\\r\\nHarry looked out for the first time at Ron\\'s house.\\r\\nIt looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra\\r\\nrooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high\\r\\nand so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which,\\r\\nHarry reminded himself, it probably was). Four or five chimneys were\\r\\nperched on top of the red roof. A lopsided sign stuck in the ground\\r\\nnear the entrance read, THE BuRRow. Around the front door lay a jumble\\r\\nof rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron. Several fat brown chickens\\r\\nwere pecking their way around the yard.\\r\\n\"It\\'s not much,\" said Ron.\\r\\n\"It\\'s wonderful,\" said Harry happily, thinking of Privet Drive.\\r\\nThey got out of the car.\\r\\n\"Now, we\\'ll go upstairs really quietly,\" said Fred, \"and wait for Mum to\\r\\ncall us for breakfast Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going,\\r\\n`Mum, look who turned up in the night!\\' and she\\'ll be all pleased to see\\r\\nHarry and no one need ever know we flew the car.\"\\r\\n\"Right,\" said Ron. \"Come on, Harry, I sleep at the - at the top\\r\\nRon had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house. The\\r\\nother three wheeled around.\\r\\nMrs. Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, and\\r\\nfor a short, plump, kind-faced woman, it was remarkable how much\\r\\nshe looked like a saber-toothed tiger.\\r\\n29\\r\\n\"Ah, \"said Fred.\\r\\n\"Oh, dear,\" said George.\\r\\nMrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips,\\r\\nstaring from one guilty face to the next. She was wearing a flowered\\r\\napron with a wand sticking out of the pocket.\\r\\n\"So, \"she said.\\r\\n\"Morning, Mum,\" said George, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty,\\r\\nwinning voice.\\r\\n\"Have you any idea how worried I\\'ve been?\" said Mrs. Weasley in a\\r\\ndeadly whisper.\\r\\n\"Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to -\"\\r\\nAll three of Mrs. Weasley\\'s sons were taller than she was, but they\\r\\ncowered as her rage broke over them.\\r\\n\"Beds empty! No note! Cargone - could have crashed - out of my\\r\\nmind with worry - did you care? - never, as long as I\\'ve lived -\\r\\nyou wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this\\r\\nfrom Bill or Charlie or Percy -\"\\r\\n\"Perfect Percy,\" muttered Fred.\\r\\n\"YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY\\'S\\r\\nBOOK!\" yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred\\'s chest. \"You\\r\\ncould have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your\\r\\nfather his job -\"\\r\\nIt seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself\\r\\nhoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away.\\r\\n\"I\\'m very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,\" she said. \"Come in and\\r\\nhave some breakfast.\"\\r\\nShe turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous\\r\\n30\\r\\nglance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her.\\r\\nThe kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a\\r\\nscrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down\\r\\non the edge of his seat, looking around. He had never been in a wizard\\r\\nhouse before.\\r\\nThe clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers\\r\\nat all. Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time\\r\\nto feed the chickens, and You\\'re late. Books were stacked three deep on\\r\\nthe mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese,\\r\\nEnchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts - It\\'s Magic! And unless\\r\\nHarry\\'s ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just\\r\\nannounced that coming up was \"Witching Hour, with the popular\\r\\nsinging sorceress, Celestina Warbeck.\"\\r\\nMrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little\\r\\nhaphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages\\r\\ninto the frying pan. Every now and then she muttered things like \"don\\'t\\r\\nknow what you were thinking of,\" and \"never would have believed it.\"\\r\\n\"I don\\'t blame you, dear,\" she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine\\r\\nsausages onto his plate. \"Arthur and I have been worried about you,\\r\\ntoo. Just last night we were saying we\\'d come and get you ourselves if\\r\\nyou hadn\\'t written back to Ron by Friday. But really,\" (she was now\\r\\nadding three fried eggs to his plate) \"flying an illegal car halfway\\r\\nacross the country - anyone could have seen you -\"\\r\\nShe flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began to\\r\\nclean themselves, clinking gently in the background.\\r\\n\"It was cloudy, Mum!\" said Fred.\\r\\n\"You keep your mouth closed while you\\'re eating!\" Mrs. Weasley\\r\\nsnapped.\\r\\n\"They were starving him, Mum!\" said George.\\r\\n\"And you!\" said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened\\r\\nexpression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n31\\r\\nAt that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small,\\r\\nredheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen,\\r\\ngave a small squeal, and ran out again.\\r\\n\"Ginny,\" said Ron in an undertone to Harry. \"My sister. She\\'s been\\r\\ntalking about you all summer.\"\\r\\n\"Yeah, she\\'ll be wanting your autograph, Harry,\" Fred said with a grin,\\r\\nbut he caught his mother\\'s eye and bent his face over his plate without\\r\\nanother word. Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean,\\r\\nwhich took a surprisingly short time.\\r\\n\"Blimey, I\\'m tired,\" yawned Fred, setting down his knife and fork at last.\\r\\n\"I think I\\'ll go to bed and -\"\\r\\n\"You will not,\" snapped Mrs. Weasley. \"It\\'s your own fault you\\'ve\\r\\nbeen up all night. You\\'re going to de-gnome the garden for me; they\\'re\\r\\ngetting completely out of hand again -\"\\r\\n\"Oh, Mum -\"\\r\\n\"And you two,\" she said, glaring at Ron and Fred. \"You can go up to\\r\\nbed, dear,\" she added to Harry. \"You didn\\'t ask them to fly that\\r\\nwretched car -\"\\r\\nBut Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, \"I\\'ll help Ron. I\\'ve\\r\\nnever seen a de-gnoming -\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s very sweet of you, dear, but it\\'s dull work,\" said Mrs. Weasley.\\r\\n\"Now, let\\'s see what Lockhart\\'s got to say on the subject -\"\\r\\nAnd she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece.\\r\\nGeorge groaned.\\r\\n\"Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden -\"\\r\\nHarry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley\\'s book. Written across it\\r\\nin fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s Guide to\\r\\nHousehold Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very good-\\r\\nIOI)king wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As always\\r\\nin the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who\\r\\n32\\r\\nHarry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at\\r\\nthem all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him.\\r\\n\"Oh, he is marvelous,\" she said. \"He knows his household pests, all\\r\\nright, it\\'s a wonderful book . . . .\"\\r\\n\"Mum fancies him,\" said Fred, in a very audible whisper.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be so ridiculous, Fred,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks rather\\r\\npink. \"All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go\\r\\nand get on with it, and woe betide you if there\\'s a single gnome in that\\r\\ngarden when I come out to inspect it.\"\\r\\nYawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry\\r\\nbehind them. The garden was large, and in Harry\\'s eyes, exactlY\\r\\nwhat a garden should be. The Dursleys wouldn\\'t have liked it - there\\r\\nwere plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting but there were\\r\\ngnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling\\r\\nfrom every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs.\\r\\n\"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,\" Harry told Ron\\r\\nthey crossed the lawn.\\r\\n\"Yeah, I\\'ve seen those things they think are gnomes,\" said Ron, bent\\r\\ndouble with his head in a peony bush, \"like fat little Santa Clauses with\\r\\nfishing rods . . . .\"\\r\\nThere was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and\\r\\nRon straightened up. \"This is a gnome,\" he said grimly.\\r\\n\"Gerroff me! Gerroff me!\" squealed the gnome.\\r\\nIt was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery\\r\\nlooking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron held\\r\\nit at arm\\'s length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he\\r\\ngrasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down.\\r\\n\"This is what you have to do,\" he said. He raised the gnome above his\\r\\nhead (\"Gerroff me!\") and started to swing it in great circles like a\\r\\nlasso. Seeing the shocked look on Harry\\'s face, Ron added, \"It doesn\\'t\\r\\nhurt them - you\\'ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can\\'t find\\r\\n33\\r\\ntheir way back to the gnomeholes.\"\\r\\nHe let go of the gnome\\'s ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and\\r\\nlanded with a thud in the field over the hedge.\\r\\n\"Pitiful,\" said Fred. \"I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.\"\\r\\nHarry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decided\\r\\njust to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome,\\r\\nsensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry\\'s finger and he\\r\\nhad a hard job shaking it off - until\\r\\n\"Wow, Harry - that must\\'ve been fifty feet ......\\r\\nThe air was soon thick with flying gnomes.\\r\\n\"See, they\\'re not too bright,\" said George, seizing five or six gnomes at\\r\\nonce. \"The moment they know the de-gnoming\\'s going on they storm\\r\\nup to have a look. You\\'d think they\\'d have learned by now just to stay\\r\\nput.\"\\r\\nSoon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a\\r\\nstraggling line, their little shoulders hunched.\\r\\n\"They\\'ll be back,\" said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into\\r\\nthe hedge on the other side of the field. \"They love it here .... Dad\\'s\\r\\ntoo soft with them; he thinks they\\'re funny . . . .\"\\r\\nJust then, the front door slammed.\\r\\n\"He\\'s back!\" said George. \"Dad\\'s home!\"\\r\\nThey hurried through the garden and back into the house.\\r\\nMr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and\\r\\nhis eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he\\r\\nhad was as red as any of his children\\'s. He was wearing long green\\r\\nrobes, which were dusty and travel-worn.\\r\\n\"What a night,\" he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat\\r\\ndown around him. \"Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher\\r\\ntried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned ......\\r\\n34\\r\\nMr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed.\\r\\n\"Find anything, Dad?\" said Fred eagerly.\\r\\n\"All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,\" yawned\\r\\nMr. Weasley. \"There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn\\'t my\\r\\ndepartment, though. Mortlake was taken away for questioning about\\r\\nsome extremely odd ferrets, but that\\'s the Committee on Experimental\\r\\nCharms, thank goodness ......\\r\\n\"Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?\" said George.\\r\\n\"Just Muggle-baiting,\" sighed Mr. Weasley. \"Sell them a key that\\r\\nkeeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it\\r\\n.... Of course, it\\'s very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle\\r\\nwould admit their key keeps shrinking - they\\'ll insist they just keep\\r\\nlosing it. Bless them, they\\'ll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if\\r\\nit\\'s staring them in the face .... But the things our lot have taken to\\r\\nenchanting, you wouldn\\'t believe -\"\\r\\n\"LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?\"\\r\\nMrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr.\\r\\nWeasley\\'s eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife.\\r\\n\"C-cars, Molly, dear?\"\\r\\n\"Yes, Arthur, cars,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing. \"Imagine a\\r\\nwizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do\\r\\nwith it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was\\r\\nenchanting it to make it fly.\"\\r\\nMr. Weasley blinked.\\r\\n\"Well, dear, I think you\\'ll find that he would be quite within the law to\\r\\ndo that, even if - er - he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his\\r\\nwife the truth .... There\\'s a loophole in the law, you\\'ll find .... As long\\r\\nas he wasn\\'t intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly\\r\\nwouldn\\'t -\"\\r\\n\"Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you\\r\\n35\\r\\nwrote that law!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"Just so you could carry on\\r\\ntinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for your\\r\\ninformation, Harry arrived this morning in the car you weren\\'t\\r\\nintending to fly!\"\\r\\n\"Harry?\" said Mr. Weasley blankly. \"Harry who?\"\\r\\nHe looked around, saw Harry, and jumped.\\r\\n\"Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet you, Ron\\'s told us\\r\\nso much about -\"\\r\\n\"Your sons flew that car to Harry\\'s house and back last night.\"\\r\\nshouted Mrs. Weasley. \"What have you got to say about that, eh?\"\\r\\n\"Did you really?\" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \"Did it go all right? I - I\\r\\nmean,\" he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasley\\'s eyes, \"that -\\r\\nthat was very wrong, boys - very wrong indeed ......\\r\\n\"Let\\'s leave them to it,\" Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs. Weasley\\r\\nswelled like a bullfrog. \"Come on, I\\'ll show you my bedroom.\"\\r\\nThey slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an\\r\\nuneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up\\r\\nthrough the house. On the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry just\\r\\ncaught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it\\r\\nclosed with a snap.\\r\\n\"Ginny,\" said Ron. \"You don\\'t know how weird it is for her to be this\\r\\nshy. She never shuts up normally -\"\\r\\nThey climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling\\r\\npaint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALD\\'S ROOM.\\r\\nHarry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and\\r\\nblinked. It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron\\'s\\r\\nroom seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the\\r\\nwalls, even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had covered\\r\\nnearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same\\r\\nseven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying\\r\\n36\\r\\nbroomsticks, and waving energetically.\\r\\n\"Your Quidditch team?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"The Chudley Cannons,\" said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread,\\r\\nwhich was emblazoned with two giant black C\\'s and a speeding\\r\\ncannonball. \"Ninth in the league.\"\\r\\nRon\\'s school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a\\r\\npile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin\\r\\nMiggs, the Mad Muggle. Ron\\'s magic wand was lying on top of a fish\\r\\ntank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat,\\r\\nScabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun.\\r\\nHarry stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor\\r\\nand looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he could see\\r\\na gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys\\'\\r\\nhedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was watching him almost\\r\\nnervously, as though waiting for his opinion.\\r\\n\"It\\'s a bit small,\" said Ron quickly. \"Not like that room you had\\r\\nwith the Muggles. And I\\'m right underneath the ghoul in the attic;\\r\\nhe\\'s always banging on the pipes and groaning ......\\r\\nBut Harry, grinning widely, said, \"This is the best house I\\'ve ever\\r\\nbeen in.\"\\r\\nRon\\'s ears went pink. .\\r\\nC H4 A P T E R V O U R\\r\\nAT F L 0 V RR 11 $ H\\r\\nAND BLOTTS\\r\\nife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet\\r\\nDrive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys\\'\\r\\nhouse burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the\\r\\nfirst time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it\\r\\nshouted, \"Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!\" The ghoul in the attic howled\\r\\nand dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and\\r\\nsmall explosions from Fred and George\\'s bedroom were considered\\r\\nperfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron\\'s,\\r\\nhowever, wasn\\'t the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the\\r\\nfact that everybody there seemed to like him.\\r\\n37\\r\\nMrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him\\r\\nto eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit\\r\\nnext to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with\\r\\nquestions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things\\r\\nlike plugs and the postal service worked.\\r\\n42\\r\\n\"Fascinating.\" he would say as Harry talked him through using a\\r\\ntelephone. \"Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of\\r\\ngetting along without magic.\"\\r\\nHarry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he\\r\\nhad arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table.\\r\\nThe moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge\\r\\nbowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to\\r\\nknocking things over whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under\\r\\nthe table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like\\r\\nthe setting sun. Pretending he hadn\\'t noticed this, Harry sat down and\\r\\ntook the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him.\\r\\n\"Letters from school,\" said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron\\r\\nidentical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink.\\r\\n\"Dumbledore already knows you\\'re here, Harry - doesn\\'t miss a trick,\\r\\nthat man. You two\\'ve got them, too,\" he added, as Fred and George\\r\\nambled in, still in their pajamas.\\r\\nFor a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters.\\r\\nHarry\\'s told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King\\'s\\r\\nCross station on September first. There was also a list of the new\\r\\nbooks he\\'d need for the coming year.\\r\\nSECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:\\r\\nThe Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2\\r\\nby Miranda Goshawk\\r\\n38\\r\\nBreak with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart\\r\\nGadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart\\r\\nHolidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart\\r\\n4 \",3\\r\\nTravels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart\\r\\nVoyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart\\r\\nWanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart\\r\\nYear with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart\\r\\nFred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry\\'s.\\r\\n\"You\\'ve been told to get all Lockhart\\'s books, too!\" he said. \"The new\\r\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan - bet it\\'s a\\r\\nwitch.\"\\r\\nAt this point, Fred caught his mother\\'s eye and quickly busied himself\\r\\nwith the marmalade.\\r\\n\"That lot won\\'t come cheap,\" said George, with a quick look at his\\r\\nparents. \"Lockhart\\'s books are really expensive ......\\r\\n\"Well, we\\'ll manage,\" said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked worried. \"I\\r\\nexpect we\\'ll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny\\'s things secondhand.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?\" Harry asked Ginny.\\r\\nShe nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her\\r\\nelbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no one saw this except Harry,\\r\\nbecause just then Ron\\'s elder brother Percy walked in. He was\\r\\nalready dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater\\r\\nvest.\\r\\n\"Morning, all,\" said Percy briskly. \"Lovely day.\"\\r\\nHe sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost\\r\\nimmediately, pulling from underneath him a moulting, gray feather\\r\\nduster - at least, that was what Harry thought it was, until he saw that\\r\\nit was breathing.\\r\\n* 44\\r\\n39\\r\\n\"Errol!\" said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a\\r\\nletter from under its wing. \"Finally - he\\'s got Hermione\\'s answer. I\\r\\nwrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the\\r\\nDursleys.\"\\r\\nHe carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to\\r\\nstand him on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron lay him on\\r\\nthe draining board instead, muttering, \"Pathetic.\" Then he ripped\\r\\nopen Hermione\\'s letter and read it out loud:\\r\\n\"`Dear Ron, and Harry if you\\'re there,\\r\\n\"`I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that\\r\\nyou didn\\'t do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would\\r\\nget Harry into trouble, too. I\\'ve been really worried and if Harry is all\\r\\nright, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be bet\\r\\nter if you used a different owl because I think another delivery might\\r\\nfinish your one off.\\r\\n\"\\'I\\'m very busy with schoolwork, of course\\'- How can she be?\" said Ron\\r\\nin horror. \"We\\'re on vacation! - \\'and we\\'re going to London next\\r\\nWednesday to buy my new books. Why don\\'t we meet in Diago n Alley?\\r\\n\"`Let me know what\\'s happening as soon as you can. Love from Hermione.\\r\\n\"\\'\\r\\n\"Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,\"\\r\\nsaid Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. \"What\\'re you all up to\\r\\ntoday?\"\\r\\nHarry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a\\r\\nsmall paddock the Weasleys owned. It was surrounded by trees that\\r\\nblocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could\\r\\npractice Quidditch there, as long as they didn\\'t fly too high.\\r\\n* 4$\\r\\nThey couldn\\'t use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to\\r\\nexplain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead\\r\\nthey threw apples for one another to catch. They took turns riding\\r\\nHarry\\'s Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom;\\r\\n40\\r\\nRon\\'s old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies.\\r\\nFive minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over\\r\\ntheir shoulders. They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them, but\\r\\nhe had said he was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so\\r\\nfar; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time.\\r\\n\"Wish I knew what he was up to,\" said Fred, frowning. \"He\\'s not\\r\\nhimself. His exam results came the day before you did; twelve\\r\\nO.WL.s and he hardly gloated at all.\"\\r\\n\"Ordinary Wizarding Levels,\" George explained, seeing Harry\\'s\\r\\npuzzled look. \"Bill got twelve, too. If we\\'re not careful, we\\'ll have\\r\\nanother Head Boy in the family. I don\\'t think I could stand the shame.\"\\r\\nBill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next brother, Charlie,\\r\\nhad already left Hogwarts. Harry had never met either of them, but\\r\\nknew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt\\r\\nworking for the wizard\\'s bank, Gringotts.\\r\\n\"Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this\\r\\nyear,\" said George after a while. \"Five sets of Lockhart books! And\\r\\nGinny needs robes and a wand and everything ......\\r\\nHarry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an underground\\r\\nvault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had\\r\\nleft him. Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he had\\r\\nmoney; you couldn\\'t use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts\\r\\n46\\r\\nin Muggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account\\r\\nto the Dursleys; he didn\\'t think their horror of anything connected with\\r\\nmagic would stretch to a large pile of gold.\\r\\nMrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After a\\r\\nquick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats\\r\\nand Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and\\r\\npeered inside.\\r\\n\"We\\'re running low, Arthur,\" she sighed. \"We\\'ll have to buy some\\r\\nmore today... Ah well, guests first! After you, Harry dear!\"\\r\\n41\\r\\nAnd she offered him the flowerpot.\\r\\nHarry stared at them all watching him.\\r\\n\"W-what am I supposed to do?\" he stammered.\\r\\n\"He\\'s never traveled by Floo powder,\" said Ron suddenly. \"Sorry,\\r\\nHarry, I forgot.\"\\r\\n\"Never?\" said Mr. Weasley. \"But how did you get to Diagon Alley to\\r\\nbuy your school things last year?\"\\r\\n\"I went on the Underground -\"\\r\\n\"Really?\" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \"Were there escapators? How\\r\\nexactly -\"\\r\\n\"Not now, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Floo powder\\'s a lot quicker,\\r\\ndear, but goodness me, if you\\'ve never used it before -\"\\r\\n\"He\\'ll be all right, Mum,\" said Fred. \"Harry, watch us first.\"\\r\\nHe took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up\\r\\nto the fire, and threw the powder into the flames.\\r\\nWith a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred,\\r\\nwho stepped right into it, shouted, \"Diagon Alley!\" and vanished.\\r\\n* 41\\r\\n\"You must speak clearly, dear,\" Mrs. Weasley told Harry as George\\r\\ndipped his hand into the flowerpot. \"And be sure to get out at the right\\r\\ngrate ......\\r\\n\"The right what?\" said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped\\r\\nGeorge out of sight, too.\\r\\n\"Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know,\\r\\nbut as long as you\\'ve spoken clearly -\"\\r\\n\"He\\'ll be fine, Molly, don\\'t fuss,\" said Mr. Weasley, helping himself to\\r\\n42\\r\\nFloo powder, too.\\r\\n\"But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and\\r\\nuncle?\"\\r\\n\"They wouldn\\'t mind,\" Harry reassured her. \"Dudley would think it\\r\\nwas a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don\\'t worry about that -\"\\r\\n\"Well ... all right ... you go after Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Now,\\r\\nwhen you get into the fire, say where you\\'re going\\r\\n\"And keep your elbows tucked in,\" Ron advised.\\r\\n\"And your eyes shut,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"The soot -\"\\r\\n\"Don\\'t fidget,\" said Ron. \"Or you might well fall out of the wrong\\r\\nfireplace -\"\\r\\n\"But don\\'t panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and\\r\\nGeorge.\"\\r\\nTrying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a pinch of Floo powder\\r\\nand walked to the edge of the fire. He took a deep breath, scattered\\r\\nthe powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a\\r\\nwarm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot\\r\\nof hot ash.\\r\\n\"D-Dia-gon Alley,\" he coughed.\\r\\n48\\r\\nIt felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain. He seemed\\r\\nto be spinning very fast - the roaring in his ears was deafening -he\\r\\ntried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him\\r\\nfeel sick - something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in\\r\\ntightly, still spinning and spinning - now it felt as though cold hands\\r\\nwere slapping his face - squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred\\r\\nstream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond - his\\r\\nbacon sandwiches were churning inside him - he closed his eyes again\\r\\nwishing it would stop, and then\\r\\nHe fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses\\r\\n43\\r\\nsnap.\\r\\nDizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding\\r\\nhis broken glasses up to his eyes. He was -,cite alone, but where he\\r\\nwas, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in the\\r\\nstone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard\\'s shop - but\\r\\nnothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list.\\r\\nA glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained\\r\\npack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down\\r\\nfrom the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter,\\r\\nand rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, the\\r\\ndark, narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window\\r\\nwas definitely not Diagon Alley.\\r\\nThe sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it\\r\\nhad hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the\\r\\ndoor, but before he\\'d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on\\r\\nthe other side of the glass - and one of them was the\\r\\n49\\r\\nvery last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in\\r\\nsoot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.\\r\\nHarry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his\\r\\nleft; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack\\r\\nto peer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into\\r\\nthe shop.\\r\\nThe man who followed could only be Draco\\'s father. He had the same\\r\\npale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed\\r\\nthe shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the\\r\\ncounter before turning to his son and saying, \"Touch nothing, Draco.\"\\r\\nMalfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, \"I thought you were\\r\\ngoing to buy me a present.\"\\r\\n\"I said I would buy you a racing broom,\" said his father, drumming his\\r\\nfingers on the counter.\\r\\n\"What\\'s the good of that if I\\'m not on the House team?\" said Malfoy,\\r\\n44\\r\\nlooking sulky and bad-tempered. \"Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two\\r\\nThousand last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so he could\\r\\nplay for Gryffindor. He\\'s not even that good, it\\'s just because he\\'s\\r\\nfamous ... famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead . . . .\"\\r\\nMalfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.\\r\\n\". . . everyone thinks he\\'s so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and\\r\\nhis broomstick -\"\\r\\n\"You have told me this at least a dozen times already,\" said Mr.\\r\\nMalfoy, with a quelling look at his son. \"And I would remind you that it\\r\\nis not - prudent - to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when\\r\\nmost of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord\\r\\ndisappear - ah, Mr. Borgin.\"\\r\\n50\\r\\nA stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his\\r\\ngreasy hair back from his face.\\r\\n\"Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,\" said Mr. Borgin in a\\r\\nvoice as oily as his hair. \"Delighted - and young Master Malfoy, too -\\r\\ncharmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today,\\r\\nand very reasonably priced -\"\\r\\n\"I\\'m not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,\" said Mr. Malfoy.\\r\\n\"Selling?\" The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin\\'s face.\\r\\n\"You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more\\r\\nraids,\" said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside\\r\\npocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. \"I have a few - ah -\\r\\nitems at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call\\r\\n......\\r\\nMr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the\\r\\nlist.\\r\\n\"The Ministry wouldn\\'t presume to trouble you, sir, surely?\"\\r\\nMr. Malfoy\\'s lip curled.\\r\\n45\\r\\n\"I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still commands a\\r\\ncertain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. There\\r\\nare rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act - no doubt that fleabitten,\\r\\nMuggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it\\r\\nHarry felt a hot surge of anger.\\r\\n\"- and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear -\"\\r\\n\"I understand, sir, of course,\" said Mr. Borgin. \"Let me see. . .\"\\r\\n\"Can I have that?\" interrupted Draco, pointing at the withered hand on\\r\\nits cushion.\\r\\n51\\r\\n\"Ah, the Hand of Glory!\" said Mr. Borgin, abandoning Mr. Malfoy\\'s\\r\\nlist and scurrying over to Draco. \"Insert a candle and it gives light only\\r\\nto the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine\\r\\ntaste, sir.\"\\r\\n\"I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer,\\r\\nBorgin,\" said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, \"No\\r\\noffense, sir, no offense meant -\"\\r\\n\"Though if his grades don\\'t pick up,\" said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still,\\r\\n\"that may indeed be all he is fit for -\"\\r\\n\"It\\'s not my fault,\" retorted Draco. \"The teachers all have favorites,\\r\\nthat Hermione Granger -\"\\r\\n\"I would have thought you\\'d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family\\r\\nbeat you in every exam,\" snapped Mr. Malfoy.\\r\\n\"Ha!\" said Harry under his breath, pleased to see Draco looking both\\r\\nabashed and angry.\\r\\n\"It\\'s the same all over,\" said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice. \"Wizard\\r\\nblood is counting for less everywhere -\"\\r\\n\"Not with me,\" said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils flaring.\\r\\n46\\r\\n\"No, sir, nor with me, sir,\" said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow.\\r\\n\"In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,\" said Mr. Malfoy\\r\\nshortly. \"I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important\\r\\nbusiness elsewhere today -\"\\r\\nThey started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as Draco drew\\r\\nnearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale.\\r\\nDraco paused to examine a long coil of hangman\\'s rope and to read,\\r\\nsmirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals,\\r\\nCaution: Do Not Touch. Cursed - Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle\\r\\nOwners to Date.\\r\\n* 52\\r\\nDraco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him. He\\r\\nwalked forward - he stretched out his hand for the handle\\r\\n\"Done,\" said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. \"Come, Draco -\"\\r\\nHarry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away.\\r\\n\"Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. I\\'ll expect you at the manor tomorrow\\r\\nto pick up the goods.\"\\r\\nThe moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily manner.\\r\\n\"Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you\\r\\nhaven\\'t sold me half of what\\'s hidden in your manor ......\\r\\nMuttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back room. Harry\\r\\nwaited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could,\\r\\nslipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\nClutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared around. He had\\r\\nemerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of\\r\\nshops devoted to the Dark Arts. The one he\\'d just left, Borgin and\\r\\nBurkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window\\r\\ndisplay of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was\\r\\nalive with gigantic black spiders. Two shabby-looking wizards were\\r\\n47\\r\\nwatching him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other.\\r\\nFeeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight and\\r\\nhoping against hope he\\'d be able to find a way out of here.\\r\\nAn old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous\\r\\ncandles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn\\'t help, as Harry\\r\\nhad never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn\\'t spoken\\r\\nclearly enough through his mouthful of ashes\\r\\nback in the Weasleys\\' fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what to\\r\\ndo.\\r\\n\"Not lost are you, my dear?\" said a voice in his ear, making him jump.\\r\\nAn aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked\\r\\nhorribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showing\\r\\nmossy teeth. Harry backed away.\\r\\n\"I\\'m fine, thanks,\" he said. \"I\\'m just -\"\\r\\n\"HARRY! What d\\'yeh think yer doin\\' down there?\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded\\r\\ndown over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the\\r\\nHogwarts gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes\\r\\nflashing over his great bristling beard.\\r\\n\"Hagrid!\" Harry croaked in relief. \"I was lost - Floo powder -\"\\r\\nHagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away\\r\\nfrom the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. Her shrieks\\r\\nfollowed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright\\r\\nsunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the\\r\\ndistance - Gringotts Bank. Hagrid had steered him right into Diagon\\r\\nAlley.\\r\\n\"Yer a mess!\" said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off Harry so\\r\\nforcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside\\r\\nan apothecary. \"Skulkin\\' around Knockturn Alley, I dunno dodgy place,\\r\\nHarry - don\\' want no one ter see yeh down there -\"\\r\\n48\\r\\n\"I realized that,\" said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to brush him off\\r\\nagain. \"I told you, I was lost - what were you doing down there,\\r\\nanyway?\"\\r\\n* 54\\r\\n\"I was lookin\\' fer a Flesh-Eatin\\' Slug Repellent,\" growled Hagrid.\\r\\n\"They\\'re ruinin\\' the school cabbages. Yer not on yer own?\"\\r\\n\"I\\'m staying with the Weasleys but we got separated,\" Harry explained.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got to go and find them . . . .\"\\r\\nThey set off together down the street.\\r\\n\"How come yeh never wrote back ter me?\" said Hagrid as Harry\\r\\njogged alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride of\\r\\nHagrid\\'s enormous boots). Harry explained all about Dobby and the\\r\\nDursleys.\\r\\n\"Lousy Muggles,\" growled Hagrid. \"If I\\'d\\'ve known -\"\\r\\n\"Harry! Harry! Over here!\"\\r\\nHarry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the\\r\\nwhite flight of steps to Gringotts. She ran down to meet them, her\\r\\nbushy brown hair flying behind her.\\r\\n\"What happened to your glasses? Hello, Hagrid - Oh, it\\'s wonderful to\\r\\nsee you two again - Are you coming into Gringotts, Harry?\"\\r\\n\"As soon as I\\'ve found the Weasleys,\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Yeh won\\'t have long ter wait,\" Hagrid said with a grin.\\r\\nHarry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street\\r\\nwere Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and Mr. Weasley.\\r\\n\"Harry,\" Mr. Weasley panted. \"We hoped you\\'d only gone one\\r\\ngrate too far . He mopped his glistening bald patch. \"Molly\\'s\\r\\n49\\r\\nfrantic - she\\'s coming now -\"\\r\\n\"Where did you come out?\" Ron asked.\\r\\n\"Knockturn Alley,\" said Hagrid grimly.\\r\\n\"Excellent.\" said Fred and George together.\\r\\n\"We\\'ve never been allowed in,\" said Ron enviously.\\r\\n*55*\\r\\n\"I should ruddy well think not,\" growled Hagrid.\\r\\nMrs. Weasley now came galloping into view, her handbag swing\\r\\ning wildly in one hand, Ginny just clinging onto the other.\\r\\n\"Oh, Harry - oh, my dear - you could have been any\\r\\nwhere -\"\\r\\nGasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her\\r\\nbag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid hadn\\'t managed to\\r\\nbeat away. Mr. Weasley took Harry\\'s glasses, gave them a tap of his\\r\\nwand, and returned them, good as new.\\r\\n\"Well, gotta be off,\" said Hagrid, who was having his hand\\r\\nwrung by Mrs. Weasley (\"Knockturn Alley! If you hadn\\'t found\\r\\nhim, Hagrid!\"). \"See yer at Hogwarts!\" And he strode away, head\\r\\nand shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street.\\r\\n\"Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?\" Harry asked Ron and\\r\\nHermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps. \"Malfoy and his fa\\r\\nther.\"\\r\\n\"Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything?\" said Mr. Weasley sharply\\r\\nbehind them.\\r\\n\"No, he was selling =\\'\\r\\n\"So he\\'s worried,\" said Mr. Weasley with grim satisfaction. \"Oh,\\r\\nI\\'d love to get Lucius Malfoy for something ......\\r\\n\"You be careful, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley sharply as they were\\r\\nbowed into the bank by a goblin at the door. \"That family\\'s trou\\r\\nble. Don\\'t go biting off more than you can chew -\"\\r\\n\"So you don\\'t think I\\'m a match for Lucius Malfoy?\" said Mr.\\r\\nWeasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the\\r\\nsight of Hermione\\'s parents, who were standing nervously at the\\r\\ncounter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for\\r\\nHermione to introduce them.\\r\\n50\\r\\n,5 s\\r\\n\"But you\\'re Muggles!\" said Mr. Weasley delightedly. \"We must have a drink!\\r\\nWhat\\'s that you\\'ve got there? Oh, you\\'re changing Muggle money. Molly,\\r\\nlook!\" He pointed excitedly at the tenpound notes in Mr. Granger\\'s hand.\\r\\n\"Meet you back here,\" Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry\\r\\nwere led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.\\r\\nThe vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that sped\\r\\nalong miniature train tracks through the bank\\'s underground tunnels.\\r\\nHarry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys\\' vault, but felt\\r\\ndreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley, when it was opened.\\r\\nThere was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon.\\r\\nMrs. Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into\\r\\nher bag. Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault. He tried to\\r\\nblock the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a\\r\\nleather bag.\\r\\nBack outside on the marble steps, they all separated. Percy muttered\\r\\nvaguely about needing a new quill. Fred and George had spotted their\\r\\nfriend from Hogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were going to\\r\\na secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers\\r\\noff to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink.\\r\\n\"We\\'ll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks,\"\\r\\nsaid Mrs. Weasley, setting off with Ginny. \"And not one step down\\r\\nKnockturn Alley!\" she shouted at the twins\\' retreating backs.\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled street.\\r\\nThe bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully\\r\\n*57*\\r\\nin Harry\\'s pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three\\r\\nlarge strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped\\r\\nhappily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating\\r\\nshop windows. Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Can\\r\\nnon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until\\r\\nHermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door.\\r\\nIn Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George,\\r\\nand Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster\\'s Fabulous\\r\\n51\\r\\nWet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of bro\\r\\nken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion\\r\\nstains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small and deeply\\r\\nboring book called Prefects Who Gained Power.\\r\\n`A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers, \" Ron read\\r\\naloud off the back cover. \"That sounds fascinating . . . .\"\\r\\n\"Go away,\" Percy snapped.\\r\\n\"\\'Course, he\\'s very ambitious, Percy, he\\'s got it all planned\\r\\nout .... He wants to be Minister of Magic. . . \" Ron told Harry\\r\\nand Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it.\\r\\nAn hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts. They were by\\r\\nno means the only ones making their way to the bookshop. As they\\r\\napproached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling out\\r\\nside the doors, trying to get in. The reason for this was proclaimed\\r\\nby a large banner stretched across the upper windows:\\r\\nGILDEROY LOCKHART\\r\\nwill be signing copies of his autobiography\\r\\nMAGICAL ME\\r\\ntoday 12:30 P.m. to 4:30 P.m.\\r\\n\"We can actually meet him!\" Hermione squealed. \"I mean, he\\'s\\r\\nwritten almost the whole booklist!\"\\r\\nThe crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs.\\r\\nWeasley\\'s age. A harrassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying,\\r\\n\"Calmly, please, ladies .... Don\\'t push, there ... mind the books, now . .\\r\\n. . \"\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside. A long line wound\\r\\nright to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing\\r\\nhis books. They each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells,\\r\\nGrade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys\\r\\nwere standing with Mr. and Mrs. Granger.\\r\\n\"Oh, there you are, good,\" said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded breathless\\r\\nand kept patting her hair. \"We\\'ll be able to see him in a minute ......\\r\\nGilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded\\r\\nby large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly\\r\\n52\\r\\nwhite teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of\\r\\nforget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard\\'s\\r\\nhat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair.\\r\\nA short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs\\r\\nwith a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with\\r\\nevery blinding flash.\\r\\n\"Out of the way, there,\" he snarled at Ron, moving back to get a better\\r\\nshot. \"This is for the Daily Prophet -\"\\r\\n\"Big deal,\" said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had\\r\\nstepped on it.\\r\\nGilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked up. He saw Ron\\r\\n*59*\\r\\nand then he saw Harry. He stared. Then he leapt to his feet and positively\\r\\nshouted, \"It can\\'t be Harry Potter?\"\\r\\nThe crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forward, seized\\r\\nHarry\\'s arm, and pulled him to the front. The crowd burst into applause.\\r\\nHarry\\'s face burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the photographer, who\\r\\nwas clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys.\\r\\n\"Nice big smile, Harry,\" said Lockhart, through his own gleaming teeth.\\r\\n\"Together, you and I are worth the front page.\"\\r\\nWhen he finally let go of Harry\\'s hand, Harry could hardly feel his fingers.\\r\\nHe tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys, but Lockhart threw an arm\\r\\naround his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side.\\r\\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said loudly, waving for quiet. \"What an\\r\\nextraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a little\\r\\nannouncement I\\'ve been sitting on for some time!\\r\\n\"When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he only\\r\\nwanted to buy my autobiography -which I shall be happy to present him\\r\\nnow, free of charge-\" The crowd applauded again. \"He had no idea,\"\\r\\nLockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to\\r\\n53\\r\\nthe end of his nose, \"that he would shortly be getting much, much more\\r\\nthan my book, Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be getting\\r\\nthe real magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and\\r\\npride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of\\r\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft\\r\\nand Wizardry!\"\\r\\nThe crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being\\r\\n60\\r\\npresented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering\\r\\nslightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of the\\r\\nlimelight to the edge of the room, where Ginny was standing next to\\r\\nher new cauldron.\\r\\n\"You have these,\" Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into the\\r\\ncauldron. \"I\\'ll buy my own -\"\\r\\n\"Bet you loved that, didn\\'t you, Potter?\" said a voice Harry had no\\r\\ntrouble recognizing. He straightened up and found himself face-to-face\\r\\nwith Draco Malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer.\\r\\n\"Famous Harry Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"Can\\'t even go into a bookshop\\r\\nwithout making the front page.\"\\r\\n\"Leave him alone, he didn\\'t want all that!\" said Ginny. It was the first\\r\\ntime she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Malfoy.\\r\\n\"Potter, you\\'ve got yourself a girlfriend!\" drawled Malfoy. Ginny went\\r\\nscarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching\\r\\nstacks of Lockhart\\'s books.\\r\\n\"Oh, it\\'s you,\" said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something\\r\\nunpleasant on the sole of his shoe. \"Bet you\\'re surprised to see Harry\\r\\nhere, eh?\"\\r\\n\"Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,\" retorted\\r\\nMalfoy. \"I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for\\r\\nall those.\"\\r\\nRon went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into the cauldron,\\r\\n54\\r\\ntoo, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione grabbed the\\r\\nback of his jacket.\\r\\n\"Ron!\" said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Fred and George.\\r\\n\"What are you doing? It\\'s too crowded in here, let\\'s go outside.\"\\r\\n61\\r\\n\"Well, well, well - Arthur Weasley.\"\\r\\nIt was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco\\'s shoulder,\\r\\nsneering in just the same way.\\r\\n\"Lucius,\" said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly.\\r\\n\"Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,\" said Mr. Malfoy. \"All those raids\\r\\n... I hope they\\'re paying you overtime?\"\\r\\nHe reached into Ginny\\'s cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossy\\r\\nLockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner\\'s Guide\\r\\nto Transfiguration.\\r\\n\"Obviously not,\" Mr. Malfoy said. \"Dear me, what\\'s the use of being a\\r\\ndisgrace to the name of wizard if they don\\'t even pay you well for it?\"\\r\\nMr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny.\\r\\n\"We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard,\\r\\nMalfoy,\" he said.\\r\\n\"Clearly,\" said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGranger, who were watching apprehensively. \"The company you\\r\\nkeep, Weasley ... and I thought your family could sink no lower =\\'\\r\\nThere was a thud of metal as Ginny\\'s cauldron went flying; Mr.\\r\\nWeasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backward\\r\\ninto a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down\\r\\non all their heads; there was a yell of, \"Get him, Dad!\" from Fred or\\r\\nGeorge; Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, \"No, Arthur, no!\"; the crowd\\r\\nstampeded backward, knocking more shelves over; \"Gentlemen,\\r\\nplease - please!\" cried the assistant, and then, louder than all\\r\\n55\\r\\n\"Break it up, there, gents, break it up -\"\\r\\n62\\r\\nHagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books. In an instant he had\\r\\npulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart. Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr.\\r\\nMalfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools. He was still\\r\\nholding Ginny\\'s old Transfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyes\\r\\nglittering with malice.\\r\\n\"Here, girl - take your book - it\\'s the best your father can give you -\" Pulling\\r\\nhimself out of Hagrid\\'s grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop.\\r\\n\"Yeh should\\'ve ignored him, Arthur,\" said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr. Weasley\\r\\noff his feet as he straightened his robes. \"Rotten ter the core, the whole family,\\r\\neveryone knows that - no Malfoy\\'s worth listenin\\' ter - bad blood, that\\'s what it\\r\\nis - come on now - let\\'s get outta here.\"\\r\\nThe assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely\\r\\ncame up to Hagrid\\'s waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried up the\\r\\nstreet, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs. Weasley beside herself with\\r\\nfury.\\r\\n\"A fine example to set for your children . . . brawling in public . . . what\\r\\nGilderoy Lockhart must\\'ve thought -\"\\r\\n\"He was pleased,\" said Fred. \"Didn\\'t you hear him as we were leaving? He was\\r\\nasking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he\\'d be able to work the fight into\\r\\nhis report - said it was all publicity -\"\\r\\nBut it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the Leaky\\r\\nCauldron, where Harry, the Weasleys, and all their shopping would be\\r\\ntraveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder. They said good-bye to the\\r\\nGrangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side;\\r\\nMr. Weasley started to ask\\r\\n63\\r\\nthem how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs.\\r\\nWeasley\\'s face.\\r\\nHarry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before\\r\\n56\\r\\nhelping himself to Floo powder. It definitely wasn\\'t his favorite way to\\r\\ntravel.\\r\\nC H-H A P T E RR F I v E\\r\\nTHE WHOMPING\\r\\nWILLOW\\r\\nhe end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry\\'s liking.\\r\\nHe was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month\\r\\nat the Burrow had been the happiest of his life. It was difficult not to\\r\\nfeel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of\\r\\nwelcome he could expect next time he turned up on Privet Drive.\\r\\nOn their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner\\r\\nthat included all of Harry\\'s favorite things, ending with a\\r\\nmouthwatering treacle pudding. Fred and George rounded off the\\r\\nevening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they fiIled the kitchen\\r\\nwith red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least\\r\\nhalf an hour. Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and\\r\\nbed.\\r\\nIt took a long while to get started next morning. They were up at\\r\\ndawn, but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do.\\r\\n65\\r\\nMrs. Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and\\r\\nquills; people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of toast\\r\\nin their hands; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke his neck, tripping over a\\r\\nstray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying Ginny\\'s trunk to the car.\\r\\nHarry couldn\\'t see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a\\r\\nrat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia. He had reckoned, of\\r\\ncourse, without the special features that Mr. Weasley had added.\\r\\n\"Not a word to Molly,\" he whispered to Harry as he opened the. trunk\\r\\nand showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the\\r\\nluggage fitted easily.\\r\\n57\\r\\nWhen at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into the\\r\\nback seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting\\r\\ncomfortably side by side, and said, \"Muggles do know more than we\\r\\ngive them credit for, don\\'t they?\" She and Ginny got into the front seat,\\r\\nwhich had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench. \"I mean,\\r\\nyou\\'d never know it was this roomy from the outside, would you?\"\\r\\nMr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard,\\r\\nHarry turning back for a last look at the house. He barely had time to\\r\\nwonder when he\\'d see it again when they were back George had\\r\\nforgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes after that, they\\r\\nskidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run in for his\\r\\nbroomstick. They had almost reached the highway when Ginny\\r\\nshrieked that she\\'d left her diary. By the time she had clambered back\\r\\ninto the car, they were running very late, and tempers were running\\r\\nhigh.\\r\\n* 66\\r\\nMr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife.\\r\\n\"Molly, dear -\"\\r\\n\"No, Arthur -\"\\r\\n\"No one would see - this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I\\r\\ninstalled - that\\'d get us up in the air - then we fly above the clouds.\\r\\nWe\\'d be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser -\"\\r\\n\"I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight -\"\\r\\nThey reached King\\'s Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr. Weasley\\r\\ndashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all\\r\\nhurried into the station.\\r\\nHarry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The tricky\\r\\npart was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn\\'t\\r\\nvisible to the Muggle eye. What you had to do was walk through the\\r\\nsolid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. It didn\\'t hurt, but it had to\\r\\nbe done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing.\\r\\n\"Percy first,\" said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at the clock\\r\\n58\\r\\noverhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappear\\r\\ncasually through the barrier.\\r\\nPercy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr. Weasley went next;\\r\\nFred and George followed.\\r\\n\"I\\'ll take Ginny and you two come right after us,\" Mrs. Weasley told\\r\\nHarry and Ron, grabbing Ginny\\'s hand and setting off. In the blink of\\r\\nan eye they were gone.\\r\\n\"Let\\'s go together, we\\'ve only got a minute,\" Ron said to Harry.\\r\\nHarry made sure that Hedwig\\'s cage was safely wedged on top of his\\r\\ntrunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier. He felt\\r\\n61\\r\\nperfectly confident; this wasn\\'t nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo\\r\\npowder. Both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and\\r\\nwalked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed. A few feet\\r\\naway from it, they broke into a run and\\r\\nCRASH.\\r\\nBoth trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron\\'s trunk fell\\r\\noff with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig\\'s\\r\\ncage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking\\r\\nindignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled,\\r\\n\"What in blazes d\\'you think you\\'re doing?\"\\r\\n\"Lost control of the trolley,\" Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he\\r\\ngot up. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scene\\r\\nthat there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the\\r\\nsurrounding crowd.\\r\\n\"Why can\\'t we get through?\" Harry hissed to Ron.\\r\\n\"I dunno -\"\\r\\nRon looked wildly around. A dozen curious people were still\\r\\nwatching them.\\r\\n59\\r\\n\"We\\'re going to miss the train,\" Ron whispered. \"I don\\'t understand\\r\\nwhy the gateway\\'s sealed itself -\"\\r\\nHarry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit\\r\\nof his stomach. Ten seconds ... nine seconds ...\\r\\nHe wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the\\r\\nbarrier and pushed with all his might. The metal remained solid.\\r\\nThree seconds . . . two seconds ... one second ...\\r\\n\"It\\'s gone,\" said Ron, sounding stunned. \"The train\\'s left. What if\\r\\nMum and Dad can\\'t get back through to us? Have you got any\\r\\nMuggle money?\"\\r\\n68\\r\\nAnd they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of\\r\\nthe station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was\\r\\nparked.\\r\\nRon unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand.\\r\\nThey heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and\\r\\ngot into the front.\\r\\n\"Check that no one\\'s watching,\" said Ron, starting the ignition with\\r\\nanother tap of his wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window:\\r\\nTraffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was\\r\\nempty.\\r\\n\"Okay,\" he said.\\r\\nRon pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around\\r\\nthem vanished - and so did they. Harry could feel the seat vibrating\\r\\nbeneath him, hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his\\r\\nglasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had become a pair of\\r\\neyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of\\r\\nparked cars.\\r\\n\"Let\\'s go,\" said Ron\\'s voice from his right.\\r\\nAnd the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away,\\r\\n60\\r\\ndropping out of sight as the car rose; in seconds, the whole of London\\r\\nlay, smoky and glittering, below them.\\r\\nThen there was a popping noise and the car, Harry, and Ron\\r\\nreappeared.\\r\\n\"Uh-oh,\" said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. \"It\\'s faulty -\"\\r\\nBoth of them pummeled it. The car vanished. Then it flickered back\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\"Hold on!\" Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the acceler\\r\\n* 7 0\\r\\nator; they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everything\\r\\nturned dull and foggy.\\r\\n\"Now what?\" said Harry, blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing\\r\\nin on them from all sides.\\r\\n\"We need to see the train to know what direction to go in,\" said Ron.\\r\\n\"Dip back down again - quickly -\"\\r\\nThey dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their\\r\\nseats, squinting at the ground.\\r\\n\"I can see it!\" Harry yelled. \"Right ahead - there!\"\\r\\nThe Hogwarts Express was streaking along below them like a scarlet\\r\\nsnake.\\r\\n\"Due north,\" said Ron, checking the compass on the dashboard.\\r\\n\"Okay, we\\'ll just have to check on it every half hour or so - hold on\\r\\nAnd they shot up through the clouds. A minute later, they burst out\\r\\ninto a blaze of sunlight.\\r\\nIt was a different world. The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of\\r\\nfluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun.\\r\\n61\\r\\n\"All we\\'ve got to worry about now are airplanes,\" said Ron.\\r\\nThey looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, they\\r\\ncouldn\\'t stop.\\r\\nIt was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream. This,\\r\\nthought Harry, was surely the only way to travel - past swirls and\\r\\nturrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat\\r\\npack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeing\\r\\nFred\\'s and George\\'s jealous faces when they\\r\\n* 71\\r\\nlanded smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of\\r\\nHogwarts castle.\\r\\nThey made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and\\r\\nfarther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different\\r\\nview. London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat green\\r\\nfields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive\\r\\nwith cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches.\\r\\nSeveral uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit that\\r\\nsome of the fun was wearing off. The toffees had made them\\r\\nextremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink. He and Ron had\\r\\npulled off their sweaters, but Harry\\'s T-shirt was sticking to the back\\r\\nof his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty\\r\\nnose. He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and\\r\\nwas thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could buy\\r\\nice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch. Why\\r\\nhadn\\'t they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters?\\r\\n\"Can\\'t be much further, can it?\" croaked Ron, hours later still, as the\\r\\nsun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink.\\r\\n\"Ready for another check on the train?\"\\r\\nIt was still right below them, winding its way past a snowcapped\\r\\nmountain. It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds.\\r\\nRon put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again,\\r\\nbut as he did so, the engine began to whine.\\r\\n62\\r\\nHarry and Ron exchanged nervous glances.\\r\\n\"It\\'s probably just tired,\" said Ron. \"It\\'s never been this far before\\r\\n......\\r\\n12\\r\\nAnd they both pretended not to notice the whining growing\\r\\nlouder and louder as the sky became steadily darker. Stars were\\r\\nblossoming in the blackness. Harry pulled his sweater back on, try\\r\\ning to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving fee\\r\\nbly, as though in protest.\\r\\n\"Not far,\" said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, \"not far\\r\\nnow,\" and he patted the dashboard nervously.\\r\\nWhen they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, they\\r\\nhad to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew.\\r\\n\"There!\" Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig jump.\\r\\n\"Straight ahead!\"\\r\\nSilhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake,\\r\\nstood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle.\\r\\nBut the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed.\\r\\n\"Come on,\" Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a lit\\r\\ntle shake, \"nearly there, come on -\"\\r\\nThe engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were issuing from un\\r\\nder the hood. Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat\\r\\nvery hard as they flew toward the lake.\\r\\nThe car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his window, Harry\\r\\nsaw the smooth, black, glassy surface of the water, a mile below.\\r\\nRon\\'s knuckles were white on the steering wheel. The car wobbled\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\"Come on,\" Ron muttered.\\r\\nThey were over the lake - the castle was right ahead - Ron\\r\\nput his foot down.\\r\\nThere was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died com\\r\\npletely.\\r\\n\"Uh-oh,\" said Ron, into the silence.\\r\\nThe nose of the car dropped. They were falling, gathering speed,\\r\\nheading straight for the solid castle wall.\\r\\n\"Noooooo!\" Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they\\r\\n63\\r\\nmissed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc,\\r\\nsoaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then\\r\\nout over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time.\\r\\nRon let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of\\r\\nhis back pocket\\r\\n\"STOP! STOP!\" he yelled, whacking the dashboard and the\\r\\nwindshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up toward\\r\\nthem\\r\\n\"WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!\" Harry bellowed, lunging for the\\r\\nsteering wheel, but too late\\r\\nCRUNCH.\\r\\nWith an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick tree\\r\\ntrunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt. Steam was\\r\\nbillowing from under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in\\r\\nterror; a golfball-size lump was throbbing on Harry\\'s head where he\\r\\nhad hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron let out a low, despairing\\r\\ngroan.\\r\\n\"Are you okay?\" Harry said urgently.\\r\\n\"My wand,\" said Ron, in a shaky voice. \"Look at my wand -\"\\r\\nIt had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by a\\r\\nfew splinters.\\r\\nHarry opened his mouth to say he was sure they\\'d be able to mend it\\r\\nup at the school, but he never even got started. At that very moment,\\r\\nsomething hit his side of the car with the force of a\\r\\n* Y4 *\\r\\ncharging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an\\r\\nequally heavy blow hit the roof.\\r\\n\"What\\'s happen -?\"\\r\\nRon gasped, staring through the windshield, and Harry looked around\\r\\n64\\r\\njust in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it. The tree\\r\\nthey had hit was attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost double, and\\r\\nits gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could\\r\\nreach.\\r\\n\"Aaargh!\" said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into\\r\\nhis door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from\\r\\nknuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was\\r\\npounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving\\r\\n\"Run for it!\" Ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door, but\\r\\nnext second he had been knocked backward into Harry\\'s lap by a\\r\\nvicious uppercut from another branch.\\r\\n\"We\\'re done for!\" he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the\\r\\nfloor of the car was vibrating - the engine had restarted.\\r\\n\"Reverse!\" Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still\\r\\ntrying to hit them; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped\\r\\nitself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach.\\r\\n\"That,\" panted Ron, \"was close. Well done, car -\"\\r\\nThe car, however, had reached the end of its tether. With two sharp\\r\\nclunks, the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways: Next\\r\\nthing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground. Loud thuds told\\r\\nhim that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk; Hedwig\\'s\\r\\ncage flew through the air and burst open; she rose out of it with an\\r\\nangry screech and sped off toward the castle\\r\\nY5\\r\\nwithout a backward look. Then, dented, scratched, and steaming,\\r\\nthe car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily.\\r\\n\"Come back!\" Ron yelled after it, brandishing his broken wand.\\r\\n\"Dad\\'ll kill me!\"\\r\\nBut the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its\\r\\nexhaust.\\r\\n\"Can you believe our luck?\" said Ron miserably, bending down to\\r\\n65\\r\\npick up Scabbers. \"Of all the trees we could\\'ve hit, we had to get\\r\\none that hits back.\"\\r\\nHe glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still\\r\\nflailing its branches threateningly.\\r\\n\"Come on,\" said Harry wearily, \"we\\'d better get up to the school\\r\\n......\\r\\nIt wasn\\'t at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured. Stiff, cold,\\r\\nand bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging\\r\\nthem up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors.\\r\\n\"I think the feast\\'s already started,\" said Ron, dropping his trunk at\\r\\nthe foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a\\r\\nbrightly lit window. \"Hey - Harry - come and look - it\\'s the Sorting!\"\\r\\nHarry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the Great\\r\\nHall.\\r\\nInnumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long,\\r\\ncrowded tables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle.\\r\\nOverhead, the bewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the sky\\r\\noutside, sparkled with stars.\\r\\nThrough the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, Harry saw a long\\r\\nline of scared-looking first years fiIing into the Hall. Ginny\\r\\n* 76\\r\\nwas among them, easily visible because of her vivid Weasley ha-ir.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair\\r\\nin a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a\\r\\nstool before the newcomers.\\r\\nEvery year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new\\r\\nstudents into the four Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff,\\r\\nRavenclaw, and Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on,\\r\\nexactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it\\r\\nmuttered aloud in his ear. For a few horrible seconds he had feared\\r\\nthat the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the house that had\\r\\nturned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other -but he had\\r\\n66\\r\\nended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the\\r\\nWeasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the\\r\\nHouse Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven\\r\\nyears.\\r\\nA very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the\\r\\nhat on his head. Harry\\'s eyes wandered past him to where Professor\\r\\nDumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff\\r\\ntable, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the\\r\\ncandlelight. Several seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart,\\r\\ndressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was Hagrid,\\r\\nhuge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet.\\r\\n\"Hang on. . . \" Harry muttered to Ron. \"There\\'s an empty chair at the\\r\\nstaff table .... Where\\'s Snape?\"\\r\\nProfessor Severus Snape was Harry\\'s least favorite teacher. Harry\\r\\nalso happened to be Snape\\'s least favorite student. Cruel, sarcastic,\\r\\nand disliked by everybody except the students from his own house\\r\\n(Slytherin), Snape taught Potions.\\r\\n\"Maybe he\\'s ill!\" said Ron hopefully.\\r\\n\"Maybe he\\'s left,\" said Ha-rry, \"because he missed out on the Defense\\r\\nAgainst Dark Arts job again!\"\\r\\n\"Or he might have been sacked!\" said Ron enthusiastically. \"I mean,\\r\\neveryone hates him -\"\\r\\n\"Or maybe,\" said a very cold voice right behind them, \"he\\'s waiting to\\r\\nhear why you two didn\\'t arrive on the school train.\"\\r\\nHarry spun around. There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze,\\r\\nstood Severus Snape. He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked\\r\\nnose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he\\r\\nwas smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep\\r\\ntrouble.\\r\\n\"Follow me,\" said Snape.\\r\\nNot daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron followed Snape\\r\\nup the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with\\r\\n67\\r\\nflaming torches. A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great\\r\\nHall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and light, down a\\r\\nnarrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons.\\r\\n\"In!\" he said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and\\r\\npointing.\\r\\nThey entered Snape\\'s office, shivering. The shadowy walls were lined\\r\\nwith shelves of large glass) ars, in which floated all manner of\\r\\nrevolting things Harry didn\\'t really want to know the name of at the\\r\\nmoment. The fireplace was dark and empty. Snape closed the door\\r\\nand turned to look at them.\\r\\n\"So,\" he said softly, \"the train isn\\'t good enough for the famous Harry\\r\\nPotter and his faithful sidekick Weasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang,\\r\\ndid we, boys?\"\\r\\n\"No, sir, it was the barrier at King\\'s Cross, it -\"\\r\\n78\\r\\n\"Silence!\" said Snape coldly. \"What have you done with the\\r\\ncar?\"\\r\\nRon gulped. This wasn\\'t the first time Snape had given Harry the\\r\\nimpression of being able to read minds. But a moment later, he un\\r\\nderstood, as Snape unrolled today\\'s issue of the Evening Prophet.\\r\\n\"You were seen,\" he hissed, showing them the headline: FLY\\r\\nING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. He began to read\\r\\naloud: \"Two Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old car\\r\\nflying over the Post Office tower ... at noon in Norfolk, Mrs.\\r\\nHetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing ... Mr. Angus Fleet,\\r\\nof Peebles, reported to police ... Six or seven Muggles in all. I be\\r\\nlieve your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?\"\\r\\nhe said, looking up at Ron and smiling still more nastily. \"Dear,\\r\\ndear ... his own son. . . \"\\r\\nHarry felt as though he\\'d just been walloped in the stomach by\\r\\none of the mad tree\\'s larger branches. If anyone found out Mr.\\r\\nWeasley had bewitched the car ... he hadn\\'t thought of that ....\\r\\n\"I noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable damage\\r\\nseems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow,\"\\r\\nSnape went on.\\r\\n\"That tree did more damage to us than we -\" Ron blurted out.\\r\\n68\\r\\n\"Silence!\" snapped Snape again. \"Most unfortunately, you are\\r\\nnot in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with\\r\\nme. I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power.\\r\\nYou will wait here.\"\\r\\nHarry and Ron stared at each other, white-faced. Harry didn\\'t\\r\\nfeel hungry any more. He now felt extremely sick. He tried not to\\r\\nlook at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a\\r\\nshelf behind Snape\\'s desk. If Snape had gone to fetch Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, they were hardly any better\\r\\noff. She might be fairer than Snape, but she was still extremely strict.\\r\\nTen minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall who accompanied him. Harry had seen Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall angry on several occasions, but either he had forgotten\\r\\njust how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen her this angry\\r\\nbefore. She raised her wand the moment she entered; Harry and Ron\\r\\nboth flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where\\r\\nflames suddenly erupted.\\r\\n\"Sit,\" she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire.\\r\\n\"Explain,\" she said, her glasses glinting ominously.\\r\\nRon launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the station\\r\\nrefusing to let them through.\\r\\n\"\\r\\n-so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn\\'t get on the train.\"\\r\\n\"Why didn\\'t you send us a letter by owl? I believe you have an owl?\"\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall said coldly to Harry.\\r\\nHarry gaped at her. Now she said it, that seemed the obvious thing to\\r\\nhave done.\\r\\n\"I - I didn\\'t think -\"\\r\\n\"That,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"is obvious.\"\\r\\nThere was a knock on the office door and Snape, now looking happier\\r\\n69\\r\\nthan ever, opened it. There stood the headmaster, Professor\\r\\nDumbledore.\\r\\nHarry\\'s whole body went numb. Dumbledore was looking unusually\\r\\ngrave. He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and\\r\\n*80*\\r\\nHarry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still being\\r\\nbeaten up by the Whomping Willow.\\r\\nThere was a long silence. Then Dumbledore said, \"Please explain why\\r\\nyou did this.\"\\r\\nIt would have been better if he had shouted. Harry hated the\\r\\ndisappointment in his voice. For some reason, he was unable to look\\r\\nDumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees. He told\\r\\nDumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley owned the\\r\\nbewitched car, making it sound as though he and Ron had happened to\\r\\nfind a flying car parked outside the station. He knew Dumbledore\\r\\nwould see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no questions\\r\\nabout the car. When Harry had finished, he merely continued to peer\\r\\nat them through his spectacles.\\r\\n\"We\\'ll go and get our stuff,\" said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice.\\r\\n\"What are you talking about, Weasley?\" barked Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall.\\r\\n\"Well, you\\'re expelling us, aren\\'t you?\" said Ron.\\r\\nHarry looked quickly at Dumbledore.\\r\\n\"Not today, Mr. Weasley,\" said Dumbledore. \"But I must impress upon\\r\\nboth of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to\\r\\nboth your families tonight. I must also warn you that if you do anything\\r\\nlike this again, I will have no choice but to expel you.\"\\r\\nSnape looked as though Christmas had been canceled. He cleared his\\r\\nthroat and said, \"Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the\\r\\nDecree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious\\r\\ndamage to an old and valuable tree - surely acts of this nature -\"\\r\\n70\\r\\n* 8i\\r\\n\"It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys\\'\\r\\npunishments, Severus,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"They are in her\\r\\nHouse and are therefore her responsibility.\" He turned to Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall. \"I must go back to the feast, Minerva, I\\'ve got to give\\r\\nout a few notices. Come, Severus, there\\'s a delicious-looking cus\\r\\ntard tart I want to sample -\"\\r\\nSnape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as he allowed\\r\\nhimself to be swept out of his office, leaving them alone with Pro\\r\\nfessor McGonagall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle.\\r\\n\"You\\'d better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you\\'re\\r\\nbleeding.\"\\r\\n\"Not much,\" said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye with\\r\\nhis sleeve. \"Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted -\"\\r\\n\"The Sorting Ceremony is over,\" said Professor McGonagall.\\r\\n\"Your sister is also in Gryffindor.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, good,\" said Ron.\\r\\n\"And speaking of Gryffindor -\" Professor McGonagall said\\r\\nsharply, but Harry cut in: \"Professor, when we took the car, term\\r\\nhadn\\'t started, so - so Gryffindor shouldn\\'t really have points\\r\\ntaken from it - should it?\" he finished, watching her anxiously.\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall gave him a piercing look, but he was sure\\r\\nshe had almost smiled. Her mouth looked less thin, anyway.\\r\\n\"I will not take any points from Gryffindor,\" she said, and\\r\\nHarry\\'s heart lightened considerably. \"But you will both get a de\\r\\ntention.\"\\r\\nIt was better than Harry had expected. As for Dumbledore\\'s\\r\\nwriting to the Dursleys, that was nothing. Harry knew perfectly\\r\\nwell they\\'d just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn\\'t\\r\\nsquashed him flat.\\r\\n82\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape\\'s\\r\\ndesk. A large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of-iced\\r\\npumpkin juice appeared with a pop.\\r\\n\"You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory,\" she\\r\\nsaid. \"I must also return to the feast.\"\\r\\n71\\r\\nWhen the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a long, low whistle.\\r\\n\"I thought we\\'d had it,\" he said, grabbing a sandwich.\\r\\n\"So did I,\" said Harry, taking one, too.\\r\\n\"Can you believe our luck, though?\" said Ron thickly through a\\r\\nmouthful of chicken and ham. \"Fred and George must\\'ve flown that\\r\\ncar five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them.\" He swallowed\\r\\nand took another huge bite. \"Why couldn\\'t we get through the barrier?\"\\r\\nHarry shrugged. \"We\\'ll have to watch our step from now on, though,\"\\r\\nhe said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice. \"Wish we could\\'ve\\r\\ngone up to the feast ......\\r\\n\"She didn\\'t want us showing off,\" said Ron sagely. \"Doesn\\'t want\\r\\npeople to think it\\'s clever, arriving by flying car.\"\\r\\nWhen they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could (the plate\\r\\nkept refilling itself) they rose and left the office, treading the familiar\\r\\npath to Gryffindor Tower. The castle was quiet; it seemed that the\\r\\nfeast was over. They walked past muttering portraits and creaking\\r\\nsuits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at last\\r\\nthey reached the passage where the secret entrance to Gryffindor\\r\\nTower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a\\r\\npink silk dress.\\r\\n\"Password?\" she said as they approached.\\r\\n\"Er -\" said Harry.\\r\\nThey didn\\'t know the new year\\'s password, not having met a\\r\\nGryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost immediately; they heard\\r\\nhurrying feet behind them and turned to see Hermione dashing toward\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\"There you are! Where have you been? The most ridiculous rumors -\\r\\nsomeone said you\\'d been expelled for crashing a flying car\\r\\n\"Well, we haven\\'t been expelled,\" Harry assured her.\\r\\n\"You\\'re not telling me you did fly here?\" said Hermione, sounding\\r\\n72\\r\\nalmost as severe as Professor McGonagall.\\r\\n\"Skip the lecture,\" said Ron impatiently, \"and tell us the new\\r\\npassword.\"\\r\\n\"It\\'s `wattlebird,\"\\' said Hermione impatiently, \"but that\\'s not the point -\\r\\n\"\\r\\nHer words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady\\r\\nswung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. It looked as\\r\\nthough the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into\\r\\nthe circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and\\r\\nsquashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive. Arms reached through\\r\\nthe portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to\\r\\nscramble in after then-t.\\r\\n\"Brilliant!\" yelled Lee Jordan. \"Inspired! What an entrance! Flying a\\r\\ncar right into the Whomping Willow, people\\'ll be talking about that\\r\\none for years -\"\\r\\n\"Good for you,\" said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone\\r\\nwas patting him on the back as though he\\'d just won a marathon;\\r\\nFred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said\\r\\ntogether, \"Why couldn\\'t we\\'ve come in the car, eh?\"\\r\\n84\\r\\nRon was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could\\r\\nsee one person who didn\\'t look happy at all. Percy was visible over\\r\\nthe heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying to\\r\\nget near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged Ron in the\\r\\nribs and nodded in Percy\\'s direction. Ron got the point at once.\\r\\n\"Got to get upstairs - bit tired,\" he said, and the two of them started\\r\\npushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room,\\r\\nwhich led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories.\\r\\n\"\\'Night,\" Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl\\r\\njust like Percy\\'s.\\r\\nThey managed to get to the other side of the common room, still\\r\\nhaving their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase.\\r\\n73\\r\\nThey hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of\\r\\ntheir old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS.\\r\\nThey entered the familiar, circular room, with its five four-posters\\r\\nhung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows. Their trunks had\\r\\nbeen brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds.\\r\\nRon grinned guiltily at Harry.\\r\\n\"I know I shouldn\\'t\\'ve enjoyed that or anything, but =\\'\\r\\nThe dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year\\r\\nGryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville\\r\\nLongbottom.\\r\\n\"Unbelievable!\" beamed Seamus.\\r\\n\"Cool,\" said Dean.\\r\\n\"Amazing,\" said Neville, awestruck.\\r\\nHarry couldn\\'t help it. He grinned, too.\\r\\n* 85 *\\r\\nH-H A P T E RR s 1 x\\r\\nGILDEROY LOCKHART\\r\\nhe next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to go\\r\\ndownhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long house tables\\r\\nwere laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of\\r\\ntoast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling\\r\\n(today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor\\r\\ntable next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires\\r\\npropped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the\\r\\nway she said \"Morning,\" which told Harry that she was still\\r\\ndisapproving of the way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the\\r\\nother hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a round-faced and\\r\\naccident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever\\r\\nmet.\\r\\n\"Mail\\'s due any minute - I think Gran\\'s sending a few things I forgot.\"\\r\\n74\\r\\nHarry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was\\r\\na rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls\\r\\n86\\r\\nstreamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the\\r\\nchattering crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville\\'s head\\r\\nand, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione\\'s jug,\\r\\nspraying them all with milk and feathers.\\r\\n\"Enrol!\" said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errol\\r\\nslumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red\\r\\nenvelope in his beak.\\r\\n\"Oh, no -\" Ron gasped.\\r\\n\"It\\'s all right, he\\'s still alive,\" said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with\\r\\nthe tip of her finger.\\r\\n\"It\\'s not that - it\\'s that.\"\\r\\nRon was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to\\r\\nHarry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they\\r\\nexpected it to explode.\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"She\\'s - she\\'s sent me a Howler,\" said Ron faintly.\\r\\n\"You\\'d better open it, Ron,\" said Neville in a timid whisper. \"It\\'ll be\\r\\nworse if you don\\'t My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and\" -\\r\\nhe gulped - \"it was horrible.\"\\r\\nHarry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope.\\r\\n\"What\\'s a Howler?\" he said.\\r\\nBut Ron\\'s whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to\\r\\nsmoke at the corners.\\r\\n75\\r\\n\"Open it,\" Neville urged. \"It\\'ll all be over in a few minutes -\"\\r\\nRon stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol\\'s\\r\\nbeak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears. A split\\r\\nsecond later, Harry knew why. He thought for a moment it had\\r\\nexploded; a roar of sound fiIled the huge hall, shaking dust from the\\r\\nceiling.\\r\\n8 _\\r\\n\"- E CAR, I WO ULDN\\'T HAVE BEEN S URSTEALING\\r\\nTHE\\r\\nPRISED IF THEY\\'D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET\\r\\nHOLD OF YOU, I DON\\'T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO\\r\\nTHINK WHAT YOUR FATHERAND I WENT THROUGH WHEN\\r\\nWE SAW IT WAS GONE -\"\\r\\nMrs. Weasleys yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the\\r\\nplates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the\\r\\nstone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see\\r\\nwho had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that\\r\\nonly his crimson forehead could be seen.\\r\\n\"- LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT\\r\\nYOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN\\'T BRING\\r\\nYOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD\\r\\nBOTH HAVE DIED -\"\\r\\nHarry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up. He\\r\\ntried very hard to look as though he couldn\\'t hear the voice that was\\r\\nmaking his eardrums throb.\\r\\n\"-ABSOLUTELYDISGUSTED - YOUR FATHER\\'S FACING AN\\r\\nINQUIRY AT WORK, IT\\'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF\\r\\nYOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE\\'LL BRING YOU\\r\\nSTRAIGHT BACK HOME.\"\\r\\nA ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron\\'s\\r\\nhand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat\\r\\n76\\r\\nstunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few\\r\\npeople laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again.\\r\\nHermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top\\r\\nof Ron\\'s head.\\r\\n* 88\\r\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know what you expected, Ron, but you -\"\\r\\n\"Don\\'t tell me I deserved it,\" snapped Ron.\\r\\nHarry pushed his porridge away. His insides were burning with guilt.\\r\\nMr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nWeasley had done for him over the summer ...\\r\\nBut he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was\\r\\nmoving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules.\\r\\nHarry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the\\r\\nHufepuffs first.\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the\\r\\nvegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical\\r\\nplants were kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing:\\r\\nHermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and\\r\\nwas being perfectly friendly again.\\r\\nAs they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class\\r\\nstanding outside, waiting for Professor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and\\r\\nHermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view\\r\\nacross the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. Professor\\r\\nSprout\\'s arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt,\\r\\nHarry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its\\r\\nbranches now in slings.\\r\\nProfessor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over\\r\\nher flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her\\r\\nclothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint.\\r\\nGilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes of\\r\\nturquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise\\r\\nhat with gold trimming.\\r\\n77\\r\\n\"Oh, hello there!\" he called, beaming around at the assembled\\r\\n89\\r\\nstudents. \"Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor\\r\\na Whomping Willow! But I don\\'t want you running away with the idea\\r\\nthat I\\'m better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to have met\\r\\nseveral of these exotic plants on my travels . . .\"\\r\\n\"Greenhouse three today, chaps!\" said Professor Sprout, who was\\r\\nlooking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self.\\r\\nThere was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in\\r\\ngreenhouse one before - greenhouse three housed far more interesting\\r\\nand dangerous plants. Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt\\r\\nand unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and\\r\\nfertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrellasized\\r\\nflowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron\\r\\nand Hermione inside when Lockhart\\'s hand shot out.\\r\\n\"Harry! I\\'ve been wanting a word - you don\\'t mind if he\\'s a couple of\\r\\nminutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?\"\\r\\nJudging by Professor Sprout\\'s scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said,\\r\\n\"That\\'s the ticket,\" and closed the greenhouse door in her face.\\r\\n\"Harry,\" said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight\\r\\nas he shook his head. \"Harry, Harry, Harry.\"\\r\\nCompletely nonplussed, Harry said nothing.\\r\\n\"When I heard -well, of course, it was all my fault. Could have kicked\\r\\nmyself.\"\\r\\nHarry had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to say so\\r\\nwhen Lockhart went on, \"Don\\'t know when I\\'ve been more shocked.\\r\\nFlying a car to Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you\\'d\\r\\ndone it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry.\"\\r\\nIt was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant\\r\\nteeth even when he wasn\\'t talking.\\r\\n78\\r\\n90\\r\\n\"Gave you a taste for publicity, didn\\'t I?\" said Lockhart. \"Gave\\r\\nyou the bug. You got onto the front page of the paper with me and\\r\\nyou couldn\\'t wait to do it again.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, no, Professor, see -\"\\r\\n\"Harry, Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping\\r\\nhis shoulder. \"I understand. Natural to want a bit more once you\\'ve\\r\\nhad that first taste - and I blame myself for giving you that, be\\r\\ncause it was bound to go to your head - but see here, young man,\\r\\nyou can\\'t start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calm\\r\\ndown, all right? Plenty of time for all that when you\\'re older. Yes,\\r\\nyes, I know what you\\'re thinking! \\'It\\'s all right for him, he\\'s an in\\r\\nternationally famous wizard already!\\' But when I was twelve, I was\\r\\njust as much of a nobody as you are now. In fact, Id say I was even\\r\\nmore of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven\\'t\\r\\nthey? All that business with He-\\\\\"o-Must-Not-Be-Named!\" He\\r\\nglanced at the lightning scar on Harry\\'s forehead. \"I know, I\\r\\nknow - it\\'s not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly\\'s Most\\r\\nCharming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have - but it\\'s a\\r\\nstart, Harry, it\\'s a start.\"\\r\\nHe gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood\\r\\nstunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to\\r\\nbe in the greenhouse, he opened the door and slid inside.\\r\\nProfessor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the cen\\r\\nter of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored ear\\r\\nmuffs were lying on the bench. When Harry had taken his place\\r\\nbetween Ron and Hermione, she said, \"We\\'ll be repotting Man\\r\\ndrakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Man\\r\\ndrake?\"\\r\\nTo nobody\\'s surprise, Hermione\\'s hand was first into the air.\\r\\ns1\\r\\n\"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,\" said Hermione,\\r\\nsounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. \"It is\\r\\nused to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their\\r\\noriginal state.\"\\r\\n\"Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,\" said Professor Sprout. \"The\\r\\nMandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. It is also,\\r\\nhowever, dangerous. Who can tell me why?\"\\r\\n79\\r\\nHermione\\'s hand narrowly missed Harry\\'s glasses as it shot up again.\\r\\n\"The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,\" she said\\r\\npromptly.\\r\\n\"Precisely. Take another ten points,\" said Professor Sprout. \"Now, the\\r\\nMandrakes we have here are still very young.\"\\r\\nShe pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone\\r\\nshuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants,\\r\\npurplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite\\r\\nunremarkable to Harry, who didn\\'t have the slightest idea what\\r\\nHermione meant by the \"cry\" of the Mandrake.\\r\\n\"Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,\" said Professor Sprout.\\r\\nThere was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn\\'t\\r\\npink and fluffy.\\r\\n\"When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely\\r\\ncovered,\" said Professor Sprout. \"When it is safe to remove them, I\\r\\nwill give you the thumbs-up. Right - earmuffs on.\"\\r\\nHarry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound\\r\\ncompletely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own\\r\\nears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants\\r\\nfirmly, and pulled hard.\\r\\n*92*\\r\\nHarry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.\\r\\nInstead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out\\r\\nof the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had\\r\\npale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his\\r\\nlungs.\\r\\nProfessor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and\\r\\nplunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until\\r\\nonly the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her\\r\\nhands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs.\\r\\n80\\r\\n\"As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won\\'t kill yet,\" she\\r\\nsaid calmly as though she\\'d just done nothing more exciting than water\\r\\na begonia. \"However, they will knock you out for several hours, and as\\r\\nI\\'m sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your\\r\\nearmuffs are securely in place while you work. I will attract your\\r\\nattention when it is time to pack up.\\r\\n\"Four to a tray - there is a large supply of pots here - compost in the\\r\\nsacks over there - and be careful of the Venemous Tentacula, it\\'s\\r\\nteething.\"\\r\\nShe gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making\\r\\nit draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her\\r\\nshoulder.\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-haired\\r\\nHufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to.\\r\\n\"Justin Finch-Fletchley,\" he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand.\\r\\n\"Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter... And you\\'re\\r\\nHermione Granger - always top in everything\"\\r\\n* 9%\\r\\n(Hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too) \"- and Ron\\r\\nWeasley. Wasn\\'t that your flying car?\"\\r\\nRon didn\\'t smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind.\\r\\n\"That Lockhart\\'s something, isn\\'t he?\" said Justin happily as they\\r\\nbegan fiIling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. \"Awfully\\r\\nbrave chap. Have you read his books? Id have died of fear if Id been\\r\\ncornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and -\\r\\nzap - just fantastic.\\r\\n\"My name was down for Eton, you know. I can\\'t tell you how glad I\\r\\nam I came here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed,\\r\\nbut since I made her read Lockhart\\'s books I think she\\'s begun to see\\r\\nhow useful it\\'ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family . . . .\"\\r\\nAfter that they didn\\'t have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs were\\r\\n81\\r\\nback on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor\\r\\nSprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn\\'t. The Mandrakes\\r\\ndidn\\'t like coming out of the earth, but didn\\'t seem to want to go back\\r\\ninto it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and\\r\\ngnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a\\r\\nparticularly fat one into a pot.\\r\\nBy the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty,\\r\\naching, and covered in earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for\\r\\na quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration.\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall\\'s classes were always hard work, but today\\r\\nwas especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year\\r\\nseemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. He was\\r\\nsupposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed\\r\\n* 94\\r\\nto do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the\\r\\ndesktop avoiding his wand.\\r\\nRon was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand\\r\\nwith some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond\\r\\nrepair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time\\r\\nRon tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke\\r\\nthat smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron\\r\\naccidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a\\r\\nnew one. Professor McGonagall wasn\\'t pleased.\\r\\nHarry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a wrung\\r\\nsponge. Everyone fiIed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who\\r\\nwas whacking his wand furiously on the desk.\\r\\n\"Stupid - useless - thing -\"\\r\\n\"Write home for another one,\" Harry suggested as the wand let off a\\r\\nvolley of bangs like a firecracker.\\r\\n\"Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,\" said Ron, stuffing the now\\r\\nhissing wand into his bag. \" `It\\'s your own fault your wand got snapped -\\r\\n\\'\"\\r\\n82\\r\\nThey went down to lunch, where Ron\\'s mood was not improved by\\r\\nHermione\\'s showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had\\r\\nproduced in Transfiguration.\\r\\n\"What\\'ve we got this afternoon?\" said Harry, hastily changing the\\r\\nsubject.\\r\\n\"Defense Against the Dark Arts,\" said Hermione at once.\\r\\n\"Why, \"demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, \"have you outlined all\\r\\nLockhart\\'s lessons in little hearts?\"\\r\\nHermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously.\\r\\n* 95 *\\r\\nThey finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard.\\r\\nHermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages\\r\\nwith Vampires again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for\\r\\nseveral minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely\\r\\nwatched. Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he\\'d\\r\\nseen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though\\r\\ntransfixed. He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle\\r\\ncamera, and the moment Harry looked at him, he went bright red.\\r\\n\"All right, Harry? I\\'m -I\\'m Colin Creevey,\" he said breathlessly, taking\\r\\na tentative step forward. \"I\\'m in Gryffindor, too. D\\'you think - would it\\r\\nbe all right if - can I have a picture?\" he said, raising the camera\\r\\nhopefully.\\r\\n\"A picture?\" Harry repeated blankly.\\r\\n\"So I can prove I\\'ve met you,\" said Colin Creevey eagerly, edging\\r\\nfurther forward. \"I know all about you. Everyone\\'s told me. About\\r\\nhow you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he\\r\\ndisappeared and everything and how you\\'ve still got a lightning scar on\\r\\nyour forehead\" (his eyes raked Harry\\'s hairline) \"and a boy in my\\r\\ndormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures\\'ll\\r\\nmove.\" Colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said,\\r\\n\"It\\'s amazing here, isn\\'t it? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do\\r\\nwas magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts. My dad\\'s a milkman, he\\r\\ncouldn\\'t believe it either. So I\\'m taking loads of pictures to send home\\r\\n83\\r\\nto him. And it\\'d be really good if I had one of you\" - he looked\\r\\nimploringly at Harry - \"maybe your friend could take it and I could\\r\\nstand next to you? And then, could you sign it?\"\\r\\n96\\r\\n\"Signed photos? You\\'re giving out signed photos, Potter?\"\\r\\nLoud and scathing, Draco Malfoy\\'s voice echoed around the\\r\\ncourtyard. He had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he always\\r\\nwas at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and\\r\\nGoyle.\\r\\n\"Everyone line up!\" Malfoy roared to the crowd. \"Harry Potter\\'s\\r\\ngiving out signed photos!\"\\r\\n\"No, I\\'m not,\" said Harry angrily, his fists clenching. \"Shut up,\\r\\nMalfoy.\"\\r\\n\"You\\'re just jealous,\" piped up Colin, whose entire body was about\\r\\nas thick as Crabbe\\'s neck.\\r\\n`jealous?\"said Malfoy, who didn\\'t need to shout anymore: half the\\r\\ncourtyard was listening in. \"Of what? I don\\'t want a foul scar right\\r\\nacross my head, thanks. I don\\'t think getting your head cut open\\r\\nmakes you that special, myself.\"\\r\\nCrabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly.\\r\\n\"Eat slugs, Malfoy,\" said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped laughing and\\r\\nstarted rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way.\\r\\n\"Be careful, Weasley,\" sneered Malfoy. \"You don\\'t want to start any\\r\\ntrouble or your Mommy\\'ll have to come and take you away from\\r\\nschool.\" He put on a shrill, piercing voice. \"Ifyou put another toe\\r\\nout of line\\' - \"\\r\\nA knot of Slytherin fifth-years nearby laughed loudly at this.\\r\\n\"Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,\" smirked Malfoy. \"It\\'d\\r\\nbe worth more than his family\\'s whole house -\"\\r\\n84\\r\\nRon whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut Voyages\\r\\nwith Vampires with a snap and whispered, \"Look out!\"\\r\\n\"What\\'s all this, what\\'s all this?\" Gilderoy Lockhart was striding\\r\\n* 97\\r\\ntoward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him. \"Who\\'s giv\\r\\ning out signed photos?\"\\r\\nHarry started to speak but he was cut short as Lockhart flung an\\r\\narm around his shoulders and thundered jovially, \"Shouldn\\'t have\\r\\nasked! We meet again, Harry!\"\\r\\nPinned to Lockhart\\'s side and burning with humiliation, Harry\\r\\nsaw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd.\\r\\n\"Come on then, Mr. Creevey,\" said Lockhart, beaming at Colin.\\r\\n\"A double portrait, can\\'t do better than that, and we\\'ll both sign it\\r\\nfor you.\"\\r\\nColin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell\\r\\nrang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes.\\r\\n\"Off you go, move along there,\" Lockhart called to the crowd,\\r\\nand he set off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing he\\r\\nknew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to his side.\\r\\n\"A word to the wise, Harry,\" said Lockhart paternally as they\\r\\nentered the building through a side door. \"I covered up for you\\r\\nback there with young Creevey - if he was photographing me,\\r\\ntoo, your schoolmates won\\'t think you\\'re setting yourself up so\\r\\nmuch . . . .\"\\r\\nDeaf to Harry\\'s stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor\\r\\nlined with staring students and up a staircase.\\r\\n\"Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of\\r\\nyour career isn\\'t sensible - looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be\\r\\nfrank. There may well come a time when, like me, you\\'ll need to\\r\\nkeep a stack handy wherever you go, but\" - he gave a little chor\\r\\ntle - \"I don\\'t think you\\'re quite there yet.\"\\r\\nThey had reached Lockhart\\'s classroom and he let Harry go at\\r\\n98\\r\\nlast. Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very\\r\\nback of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven of\\r\\nLockhart\\'s books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at the\\r\\nreal thing.\\r\\n85\\r\\nThe rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Hermione sat\\r\\ndown on either side of Harry.\\r\\n\"You could\\'ve fried an egg on your face\" said Ron. \"You\\'d better hope\\r\\nCreevey doesn\\'t meet Ginny, or they\\'ll be starting a Harry Potter fan\\r\\nclub.\"\\r\\n\"Shut up,\" snapped Harry. The last thing he needed was for Lockhart\\r\\nto hear the phrase \"Harry Potter fan club.\"\\r\\nWhen the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared his throat loudly\\r\\nand silence fell. He reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom\\'s\\r\\ncopy of Travels with Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winking\\r\\nportrait on the front.\\r\\n\"Me,\" he said, pointing at it and winking as well. \"Gilderoy Lockhart,\\r\\nOrder of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force\\r\\nDefense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly\\'s Most-\\r\\nCharming-Smile Award - but I don\\'t talk about that. I didn\\'t get rid of\\r\\nthe Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!\"\\r\\nHe waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly.\\r\\n\"I see you\\'ve all bought a complete set of my books -well done. I\\r\\nthought we\\'d start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about\\r\\njust to check how well you\\'ve read them, how much you\\'ve taken in -\"\\r\\nWhen he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of\\r\\nthe class and said, \"You have thirty minutes - start - now!\"\\r\\nHarry looked down at his paper and read:\\r\\n1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart \\'s favorite color?\\r\\n2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s secret ambition?\\r\\n3. What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s greatest\\r\\nachievement to date?\\r\\n86\\r\\nOn and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to:\\r\\n54. When is Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s birthday, and what would his\\r\\nideal gift be?\\r\\nHalf an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through\\r\\nthem in front of the class.\\r\\n\"Tut, tut - hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is\\r\\nlilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. And a few of you need to read\\r\\nWanderings with Werewolves more carefully - I clearly state in chapter\\r\\ntwelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all\\r\\nmagic and non-magic peoples - though I wouldn\\'t say no to a large\\r\\nbottle of Ogdeds Old Firewhisky!\"\\r\\nHe gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring at\\r\\nLockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face; Seamus\\r\\nFinnigan and Dean Thomas, who were sitting in front, were shaking\\r\\nwith silent laughter. Hermione, on the other hand, was listening to\\r\\nLockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her\\r\\nname.\\r\\n\". . . but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the\\r\\nworld of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions - good\\r\\ngirl! In fact\" - he flipped her paper over - \"full marks! Where is Miss\\r\\nHermione Granger?\"\\r\\n*100*\\r\\nHermione raised a trembling hand.\\r\\n\"Excellent!\" beamed Lockhart. \"Quite excellent! Take ten points for\\r\\nGryffindor! And so - to business -\"\\r\\nHe bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it.\\r\\n\"Now - be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest\\r\\ncreatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing your\\r\\nworst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst\\r\\nI am here. All I ask is that you remain calm.\"\\r\\nIn spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of books for a better\\r\\n87\\r\\nlook at the cage. Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean and\\r\\nSeamus had stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering in his front\\r\\nrow seat.\\r\\n\"I must ask you not to scream,\" said Lockhart in a low voice. \"It might\\r\\nprovoke them.\"\\r\\nAs the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the cover.\\r\\n\"Yes,\" he said dramatically. \"Freshly caught Cornish pixies. \"\\r\\nSeamus Finnigan couldn\\'t control himself. He let out a snort of\\r\\nlaughter that even Lockhart couldn\\'t mistake for a scream of terror.\\r\\n\"Yes?\" He smiled at Seamus.\\r\\n\"Well, they\\'re not - they\\'re not very - dangerous, are they?\" Seamus\\r\\nchoked.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be so sure!\" said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at\\r\\nSeamus. \"Devilish tricky little blighters they can be!\"\\r\\nThe pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed\\r\\nfaces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies\\r\\narguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they\\r\\n*101*\\r\\nhad started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and\\r\\nmaking bizarre faces at the people nearest them.\\r\\n\"Right, then,\" Lockhart said loudly. \"Let\\'s see what you make of\\r\\nthem!\" And he opened the cage.\\r\\nIt was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like rockets.\\r\\nTwo of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air.\\r\\nSeveral shot straight through the window, showering the back row\\r\\nwith broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more\\r\\neffectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and\\r\\nsprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures\\r\\nfrom the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books\\r\\nand threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the\\r\\n88\\r\\nclass was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the\\r\\niron chandelier in the ceiling.\\r\\n\"Come on now - round them up, round them up, they\\'re only pixies,\"\\r\\nLockhart shouted.\\r\\nHe rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed,\\r\\n\"Peskipiksi Pesternomi!\"\\r\\nIt had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and\\r\\nthrew it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his\\r\\nown desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a\\r\\nsecond later as the chandelier gave way.\\r\\nThe bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relative\\r\\ncalm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry,\\r\\nRon, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, \"Well, I\\'ll\\r\\nask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.\" He\\r\\nswept past them and shut the door quickly behind him.\\r\\n*102*\\r\\n\"Can you believe him?\" roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit\\r\\nhim painfully on the ear.\\r\\n\"He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,\" said Hermione,\\r\\nimmobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and\\r\\nstuffing them back into their cage.\\r\\n\"Hands on? \"said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of\\r\\nreach with its tongue out. \"Hermione, he didn\\'t have a clue what he\\r\\nwas doing -\"\\r\\n\"Rubbish,\" said Hermione. \"You\\'ve read his books - look at all those\\r\\namazing things he\\'s done -\"\\r\\n\"He says he\\'s done,\" Ron muttered.\\r\\narry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight\\r\\nwhenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder\\r\\n89\\r\\nto avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry\\'s\\r\\nschedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, \"All\\r\\nright, Harry?\" six or seven times a day and hear, \"Hello, Colin,\" back,\\r\\nhowever exasperated Harry sounded when he said it.\\r\\nHedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey\\r\\nand Ron\\'s wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday\\r\\nmorning by shooting out of Ron\\'s hand in Charms and hitting tiny old\\r\\nProfessor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large,\\r\\nthrobbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and\\r\\nanother, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and\\r\\nHermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry,\\r\\nhowever, was shaken awake several hours earlier\\r\\n*104*\\r\\nthan he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor\\r\\nQuidditch team.\\r\\n\"Whassamatter?\" said Harry groggily.\\r\\n\"Quidditch practice!\" said Wood. \"Come on!\"\\r\\nHarry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across\\r\\nthe pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn\\'t\\r\\nunderstand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were\\r\\nmaking.\\r\\n\"Oliver,\" Harry croaked. \"It\\'s the crack of dawn.\"\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the\\r\\nmoment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. \"It\\'s part\\r\\nof our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let\\'s go,\"\\r\\nsaid Wood heartily. \"None of the other teams have started training yet;\\r\\nwe\\'re going to be first off the mark this year -\"\\r\\nYawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to\\r\\nfind his Quidditch robes.\\r\\n\"Good man,\" said Wood. \"Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.\\r\\n90\\r\\nWhen he\\'d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for\\r\\nwarmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he\\'d gone and\\r\\nwent down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two\\r\\nThousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the portrait hole when\\r\\nthere was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down\\r\\nthe spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and\\r\\nsomething clutched in his hand.\\r\\n\"I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look what\\r\\nI\\'ve got here! I\\'ve had it developed, I wanted to show you -\"\\r\\n*105*\\r\\nHarry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing\\r\\nunder his nose.\\r\\nA moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm\\r\\nHarry recognized as his own. He was pleased to see that his\\r\\nphotographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be\\r\\ndragged into view. As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and\\r\\nslumped, panting, against the white edge of the picture.\\r\\n\"Will you sign it?\" said Colin eagerly.\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was\\r\\nreally deserted. \"Sorry, Colin, I\\'m in a hurry - Quidditch practice -\"\\r\\nHe climbed through the portrait hole.\\r\\n\"Oh, wow! Wait for me! I\\'ve never watched a Quidditch game\\r\\nbefore!\"\\r\\nColin scrambled through the hole after him.\\r\\n\"It\\'ll be really boring,\" Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his\\r\\nface shining with excitement.\\r\\n\"You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren\\'t\\r\\nyou, Harry? Weren\\'t you?\" said Colin, trotting alongside him. \"You\\r\\nmust be brilliant. I\\'ve never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own\\r\\nbroom? Is that the best one there is?\"\\r\\n91\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t know how to get rid of him. It was like having an\\r\\nextremely talkative shadow.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t really understand Quidditch,\" said Colin breathlessly. \"Is it\\r\\ntrue there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock\\r\\npeople off their brooms?\"\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated\\r\\nrules of Quidditch. \"They\\'re called Bludgers. There are two Beaters\\r\\n), *106*\\r\\non each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their\\r\\nside. Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.\"\\r\\n\"And what are the other balls for?\" Colin asked, tripping down a\\r\\ncouple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry.\\r\\n\"Well, the Quafe - that\\'s the biggish red one - is the one that scores\\r\\ngoals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other\\r\\nand try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch -\\r\\nthey\\'re three long poles with hoops on the end.\"\\r\\n\"And the fourth ball -\"\\r\\n\"- is the Golden Snitch,\" said Harry, \"and it\\'s very small, very fast, and\\r\\ndifficult to catch. But that\\'s what the Seeker\\'s got to do, because a\\r\\ngame of Quidditch doesn\\'t end until the Snitch has been caught. And\\r\\nwhichever team\\'s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra\\r\\nhundred and fifty points.\"\\r\\n\"And you\\'re the Gryffindor Seeker, aren\\'t you?\" said Colin in awe.\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dewdrenched\\r\\ngrass. \"And there\\'s the Keeper, too. He guards the goal\\r\\nposts. That\\'s it, really.\"\\r\\nBut Colin didn\\'t stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping\\r\\nlawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he\\r\\nreached the changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice,\\r\\n\"I\\'ll go and get a good seat, Harry!\" and hurried off to the stands.\\r\\n92\\r\\nThe rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room.\\r\\nWood was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George\\r\\nWeasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and touslehaired, next to fourth year\\r\\nAlicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind\\r\\nher. Her fellow Chasers, Katie\\r\\n*107*\\r\\nBell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\"There you are, Harry, what kept you?\" said Wood briskly. \"Now, I\\r\\nwanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field,\\r\\nbecause I spent the summer devising a whole new training program,\\r\\nwhich I really think will make all the difference ....\\r\\nWood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which\\r\\nwere drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in differentcolored inks.\\r\\nHe took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to\\r\\nwiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood launched into a\\r\\nspeech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley\\'s head drooped right\\r\\nonto Alicia Spinnet\\'s shoulder and he began to snore.\\r\\nThe first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was\\r\\nanother board under that, and a third under that one. Harry sank into\\r\\na stupor as Wood droned on and on.\\r\\n\"So,\" said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy\\r\\nabout what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up\\r\\nat the castle. \"Is that clear? Any questions?\"\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got a question, Oliver,\" said George, who had woken with a\\r\\nstart. \"Why couldn\\'t you have told us all this yesterday when we\\r\\nwere awake?\"\\r\\nWood wasn\\'t pleased.\\r\\n\"Now, listen here, you lot,\" he said, glowering at them all. \"We\\r\\nshould have won the Quidditch cup last year. We\\'re easily the best\\r\\nteam. But unfortunately -owing to circumstances beyond our control -\\r\\n\"\\r\\n93\\r\\n*108*\\r\\nHarry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the\\r\\nhospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that\\r\\nGryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst\\r\\ndefeat in three hundred years.\\r\\nWood took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeat\\r\\nwas clearly still torturing him.\\r\\n\"So this year, we train harder than ever before .... Okay, let\\'s go and\\r\\nput our new theories into practice!\" Wood shouted, seizing his\\r\\nbroomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms. Stifflegged\\r\\nand still yawning, his team followed.\\r\\nThey had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up\\r\\ncompletely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the\\r\\nstadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione\\r\\nsitting in the stands.\\r\\n\"Aren\\'t you finished yet?\" called Ron incredulously.\\r\\n\"Haven\\'t even started,\" said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and\\r\\nmarmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall.\\r\\n\"Wood\\'s been teaching us new moves.\"\\r\\nHe mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into\\r\\nthe air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more\\r\\neffectively than Wood\\'s long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the\\r\\nQuidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed,\\r\\nracing Fred and George.\\r\\n\"What\\'s that funny clicking noise?\" called Fred as they hurtled around\\r\\nthe corner.\\r\\nHarry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highest\\r\\nseats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound\\r\\nstrangely magnified in the deserted stadium.\\r\\n*io9*\\r\\n94\\r\\n\"Look this way, Harry! This way!\" he cried shrilly.\\r\\n\"Who\\'s that?\" said Fred.\\r\\n\"No idea,\" Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far\\r\\naway as possible from Colin.\\r\\n\"What\\'s going on?\" said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the\\r\\nair toward them. \"Why\\'s that first year taking pictures? I don\\'t like it.\\r\\nHe could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training\\r\\nprogram.\"\\r\\n\"He\\'s in Gryffindor,\" said Harry quickly.\\r\\n\"And the Slytherins don\\'t need a spy, Oliver,\" said George.\\r\\n\"What makes you say that?\" said Wood testily.\\r\\n\"Because they\\'re here in person,\" said George, pointing.\\r\\nSeveral people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks\\r\\nin their hands.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe it!\" Wood hissed in outrage. \"I booked the field for\\r\\ntoday! We\\'ll see about this!\"\\r\\nWood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to\\r\\nin his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harry, Fred, and\\r\\nGeorge followed.\\r\\n\"Flint!\" Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. \"This is our practice\\r\\ntime! We got up specially! You can clear off now!\"\\r\\nMarcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a look of trollish\\r\\ncunning on his face as he replied, \"Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.\"\\r\\nAngelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls\\r\\non the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the\\r\\nGryffindors, leering to a man.\\r\\n\"But I booked the field!\" said Wood, positively spitting with rage. \"I\\r\\nbooked it!\"\\r\\n95\\r\\n*110*\\r\\n\"Ah,\" said Flint. \"But I\\'ve got a specially signed note here from\\r\\nProfessor Snape. `I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team\\r\\npermission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to\\r\\ntrain their new Seeker.\"\\'\\r\\n\"You\\'ve got a new Seeker?\" said Wood, distracted. \"Where?\"\\r\\nAnd from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh,\\r\\nsmaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was Draco\\r\\nMalfoy.\\r\\n\"Aren\\'t you Lucius Malfoy\\'s son?\" said Fred, looking at Malfoy with\\r\\ndislike.\\r\\n\"Funny you should mention Draco\\'s father,\" said Flint as the whole\\r\\nSlytherin team smiled still more broadly. \"Let me show you the\\r\\ngenerous gift he\\'s made to the Slytherin team.\"\\r\\nAll seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished,\\r\\nbrand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the\\r\\nwords Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors\\'\\r\\nnoses in the early morning sun.\\r\\n\"Very latest model. Only came out last month,\" said Flint carelessly,\\r\\nflicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. \"I believe it outstrips\\r\\nthe old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the old\\r\\nCleansweeps\" - he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both\\r\\nclutching Cleansweep Fives - \"sweeps the board with them.\"\\r\\nNone of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a\\r\\nmoment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced\\r\\nto slits.\\r\\n\"Oh, look,\" said Flint. \"A field invasion.\"\\r\\nRon and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on.\\r\\n*111*\\r\\n96\\r\\n\"What\\'s happening?\" Ron asked Harry. \"Why aren\\'t you playing? And\\r\\nwhat\\'s he doing here?\"\\r\\nHe was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes.\\r\\n\"I\\'m the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,\" said Malfoy, smugly.\\r\\n\"Everyone\\'s just been admiring the brooms my father\\'s bought our\\r\\nteam.\\r\\nRon gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\"Good, aren\\'t they?\" said Malfoy smoothly. \"But perhaps the\\r\\nGryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms,\\r\\ntoo. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum\\r\\nwould bid for them.\"\\r\\nThe Slytherin team howled with laughter.\\r\\n\"At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,\" said\\r\\nHermione sharply. \"They got in on pure talent.\"\\r\\nThe smug look on Malfoy\\'s face flickered.\\r\\n\"No one asked your opinion, you fiIthy little Mudblood,\" he spat.\\r\\nHarry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad\\r\\nbecause there was an instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive in\\r\\nfront of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia\\r\\nshrieked, \"How dare you!\" ; and Ron plunged his hand into his robes,\\r\\npulled out his wand, yelling, \"You\\'ll pay for that one, Malfoy!\" and\\r\\npointed it furiously under Flint\\'s arm at Malfoys face.\\r\\nA loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot\\r\\nout of the wrong end of Ron\\'s wand, hitting him in the stomach and\\r\\nsending him reeling backward onto the grass.\\r\\n12\\r\\n\"Ron! Ron! Are you all right?\" squealed Hermione.\\r\\nRon opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead he\\r\\n97\\r\\ngave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth\\r\\nonto his lap.\\r\\nThe Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. Flint was doubled\\r\\nup, hanging onto his new broomstick for support. Malfoy was on all\\r\\nfours, banging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were\\r\\ngathered around Ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs.\\r\\nNobody seemed to want to touch him.\\r\\n\"We\\'d better get him to Hagrid\\'s, it\\'s nearest,\" said Harry to\\r\\nHermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up\\r\\nby the arms.\\r\\n\"What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? But you can\\r\\ncure him, can\\'t you?\" Colin had run down from his seat and was now\\r\\ndancing alongside them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave\\r\\nand more slugs dribbled down his front.\\r\\n\"Oooh,\" said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. \"Can you hold\\r\\nhim still, Harry?\"\\r\\n\"Get out of the way, Colin!\" said Harry angrily. He and Hermione\\r\\nsupported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward\\r\\nthe edge of the forest.\\r\\n\"Nearly there, Ron,\" said Hermione as the gamekeeper\\'s cabin came\\r\\ninto view. \"You\\'ll be all right in a minute - almost there -\"\\r\\nThey were within twenty feet of Hagrid\\'s house when the front door\\r\\nopened, but it wasn\\'t Hagrid who emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart,\\r\\nwearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out.\\r\\n\"Quick, behind here,\" Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearby\\r\\nbush. Hermione followed, somewhat reluctantly.\\r\\n*113* *\\r\\n\"It\\'s a simple matter if you know what you\\'re doing!\" Lockhart was\\r\\nsaying loudly to Hagrid. \"If you need help, you know where I am! I\\'ll\\r\\nlet you have a copy of my book. I\\'m surprised you haven\\'t already got\\r\\none - I\\'ll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!\" And he\\r\\nstrode away toward the castle.\\r\\n98\\r\\nHarry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled Ron out of\\r\\nthe bush and up to Hagrid\\'s front door. They knocked urgently.\\r\\nHagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression\\r\\nbrightened when he saw who it was.\\r\\n\"Bin wonderin\\' when you\\'d come ter see me - come in, come in -\\r\\nthought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again -\"\\r\\nHarry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the oneroomed\\r\\ncabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire\\r\\ncrackling merrily in the other. Hagrid didn\\'t seem perturbed by Ron\\'s\\r\\nslug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he lowered Ron into a\\r\\nchair.\\r\\n\"Better out than in,\" he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in\\r\\nfront of him. \"Get \\'em all up, Ron.\"\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think there\\'s anything to do except wait for it to stop,\" said\\r\\nHermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin. \"That\\'s a\\r\\ndifficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand -\"\\r\\nHagrid was bustling around making them tea. His boarhound, Fang,\\r\\nwas slobbering over Harry.\\r\\n\"What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?\" Harry asked, scratching\\r\\nFang\\'s ears.\\r\\n\"Givin\\' me advice on gettin\\' kelpies out of a well,\" growled\\r\\n*114*\\r\\nHagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off his scrubbed table and\\r\\nsetting down the teapot. \"Like I don\\' know. An\\' bangin\\' on about\\r\\nsome banshee he banished. If one word of it was true, I\\'ll eat my\\r\\nkettle.\"\\r\\nIt was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts\\' teacher, and Harry\\r\\nlooked at him in surprise. Hermione, however, said in a voice\\r\\nsomewhat higher than usual, \"I think you\\'re being a bit unfair.\\r\\nProfessor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for\\r\\n99\\r\\nthe job -\"\\r\\n\"He was the on\\' man for the job,\" said Hagrid, offering them a Y\\r\\nplate of treacle fudge, while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin.\\r\\n\"An\\' I mean the on\\' one. Gettin\\' very difficult ter find anyone fer Y\\r\\nthe Dark Arts job. People aren\\'t too keen ter take it on, see. They\\'re\\r\\nstartin\\' ter think it\\'s jinxed. No one\\'s lasted long fer a while now. So\\r\\ntell me,\" said Hagrid, jerking his head at Ron. \"Who was he tryin\\' ter\\r\\ncurse?\"\\r\\n\"Malfoy called Hermione something - it must\\'ve been really bad,\\r\\nbecause everyone went wild.\"\\r\\n\"It was bad,\" said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking\\r\\npale and sweaty. \"Malfoy called her `Mudblood,\\' Hagrid -\"\\r\\nRon dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their\\r\\nappearance. Hagrid looked outraged.\\r\\n\"He didn\\'!\" he growled at Hermione.\\r\\n\"He did,\" she said. \"But I don\\'t know what it means. I could tell it\\r\\nwas really rude, of course -\"\\r\\n\"It\\'s about the most insulting thing he could think of,\" gasped Ron,\\r\\ncoming back up. \"Mudblood\\'s a really foul name for someone who is\\r\\nMuggle-born - you know, non-magic parents. There are\\r\\n*115*\\r\\nsome wizards - like Malfoy\\'s family - who think they\\'re better than\\r\\neveryone else because they\\'re what people call pure-blood.\" He\\r\\ngave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand. He\\r\\nthrew it into the basin and continued, \"I mean, the rest of us know it\\r\\ndoesn\\'t make any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom -\\r\\nhe\\'s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way\\r\\nup.\"\\r\\n\"An\\' they haven\\'t invented a spell our Hermione can\\' do,\" said Hagrid\\r\\nproudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta.\\r\\n100\\r\\n\"It\\'s a disgusting thing to call someone,\" said Ron, wiping his sweaty\\r\\nbrow with a shaking hand. \"Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It\\'s\\r\\nridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we\\r\\nhadn\\'t married Muggles we\\'d\\'ve died out.\"\\r\\nHe retched and ducked out of sight again.\\r\\n\"Well, I don\\' blame yeh fer tryin\\' ter curse him, Ron,\" said Hagrid\\r\\nloudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin. \"Bu\\' maybe it\\r\\nwas a good thing yer wand backfired. \\'Spect Lucius Malfoy\\r\\nwould\\'ve come marchin\\' up ter school if yeh\\'d cursed his son. Least\\r\\nyer not in trouble.\"\\r\\nHarry would have pointed out that trouble didn\\'t come much worse\\r\\nthan having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn\\'t; Hagrid\\'s\\r\\ntreacle fudge had cemented his jaws together.\\r\\n\"Harry,\" said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought.\\r\\n\"Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I\\'ve heard you\\'ve bin givin\\' out signed\\r\\nphotos. How come I haven\\'t got one?\"\\r\\nFurious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart.\\r\\n\"I have not been giving out signed photos,\" he said hotly. \"If\\r\\nLockhart\\'s still spreading that around -\"\\r\\n*116*\\r\\nBut then he saw that Hagrid was laughing.\\r\\n\"I\\'m on\\'y jokin\\',\" he said, patting Harry genially on the back and\\r\\nsending him face first into the table. \"I knew yeh hadn\\'t really. I told\\r\\nLockhart yeh didn\\' need teh. Yer more famous than him without\\r\\ntryin\\'.\"\\r\\n\"Bet he didn\\'t like that,\" said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin.\\r\\n\"Don\\' think he did,\" said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling. \"An\\' then I told\\r\\nhim Id never read one o\\' his books an\\' he decided ter go. Treacle\\r\\nfudge, Ron?\" he added as Ron reappeared.\\r\\n101\\r\\n\"No thanks,\" said Ron weakly. \"Better not risk it.\"\\r\\n\"Come an\\' see what I\\'ve bin growin\\',\" said Hagrid as Harry and\\r\\nHermione finished the last of their tea.\\r\\nIn the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid\\'s house were a dozen of\\r\\nthe largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen. Each was the size of a\\r\\nlarge boulder.\\r\\n\"Gettin\\' on well, aren\\'t they?\" said Hagrid happily. \"Fer the Halloween\\r\\nfeast ... should be big enough by then.\"\\r\\n\"What\\'ve you been feeding them?\" said Harry.\\r\\nHagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone.\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'ve bin givin\\' them - you know - a bit o\\' help -\"\\r\\nHarry noticed Hagrid\\'s flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back\\r\\nwall of the cabin. Harry had had reason to believe before now that\\r\\nthis umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong\\r\\nimpression that Hagrid\\'s old school wand was concealed inside it.\\r\\nHagrid wasn\\'t supposed to use magic. He had been expelled from\\r\\nHogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why -any\\r\\nmention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his\\r\\n*117*\\r\\nthroat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was\\r\\nchanged.\\r\\n\"An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?\" said Hermione, halfway\\r\\nbetween disapproval and amusement. \"Well, you\\'ve done a good job on\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s what yer little sister said,\" said Hagrid, nodding at Ron. \"Met\\r\\nher jus\\' yesterday.\" Hagrid looked sideways at Harry, his beard\\r\\ntwitching. \"Said she was jus\\' lookin\\' round the grounds, but I reckon\\r\\nshe was hopin\\' she might run inter someone else at my house.\" He\\r\\nwinked at Harry. \"If yeh ask me, she wouldn\\' say no ter a signed -\"\\r\\n\"Oh, shut up,\" said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter and the ground\\r\\n102\\r\\nwas sprayed with slugs.\\r\\n\"Watch it!\" Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious\\r\\npumpkins.\\r\\nIt was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle\\r\\nfudge since dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat. They said\\r\\ngood-bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing\\r\\noccasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs.\\r\\nThey had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang\\r\\nout, \"There you are, Potter - Weasley.\" Professor McGonagall was\\r\\nwalking toward them, looking stern. \"You will both do your detentions\\r\\nthis evening.\"\\r\\n\"What\\'re we doing, Professor?\" said Ron, nervously suppressing a\\r\\nburp.\\r\\n\"You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch,\"\\r\\nsaid Professor McGonagall. \"And no magic, Weasley - elbow grease.\"\\r\\n*118*\\r\\nRon gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student\\r\\nin the school.\\r\\n\"And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan\\r\\nmail,\" said Professor McGonagall.\\r\\n\"Oh n - Professor, can\\'t I go and do the trophy room, too?\" said Harry\\r\\ndesperately.\\r\\n\"Certainly not,\" said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows.\\r\\n\"Professor Lockhart requested you particularly. Eight o\\'clock sharp,\\r\\nboth of you.\"\\r\\nHarry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest\\r\\ngloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-schoolrules\\r\\nsort of expression. Harry didn\\'t enjoy his shepherd\\'s pie as\\r\\nmuch as he\\'d thought. Both he and Ron felt they\\'d got the worse deal.\\r\\n\"Filch\\'ll have me there all night,\" said Ron heavily. \"No magic! There\\r\\n103\\r\\nmust be about a hundred cups in that room. I\\'m no good at Muggle\\r\\ncleaning.\"\\r\\n\"I\\'d swap anytime,\" said Harry hollowly. \"I\\'ve had loads of practice\\r\\nwith the Dursleys. Answering Lockhart\\'s fan mail ... he\\'ll be a\\r\\nnightmare ......\\r\\nSaturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no\\r\\ntime, it was five minutes to eight, and Harry was dragging his feet\\r\\nalong the second-floor corridor to Lockhart\\'s office. He gritted his\\r\\nteeth and knocked.\\r\\nThe door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at him.\\r\\n\"Ah, here\\'s the scalawag!\" he said. \"Come in, Harry, come in -\"\\r\\nShining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were\\r\\ncountless framed photographs of Lockhart. He had even signed a few\\r\\nof them. Another large pile lay on his desk.\\r\\n\"You can address the envelopes!\" Lockhart told Harry, as though\\r\\nthis was a huge treat. \"This first one\\'s to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her -\\r\\nhuge fan of mine -\"\\r\\nThe minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart\\'s voice wash over him,\\r\\noccasionally saying, \"Mmm\" and \"Right\" and \"Yeah.\" Now and then\\r\\nhe caught a phrase like, \"Fame\\'s a fickle friend, Harry,\" or \"Celebrity\\r\\nis as celebrity does, remember that.\"\\r\\nThe candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the\\r\\nmany moving faces of Lockhart watching him. Harry moved his\\r\\naching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out\\r\\nVeronica Smethley\\'s address. It must be nearly time to leave, Harry\\r\\nthought miserably, please let it be nearly time...\\r\\nAnd then he heard something - something quite apart from the\\r\\nspitting of the dying candles and Lockhart\\'s prattle about his fans.\\r\\nIt was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of\\r\\nbreathtaking, ice-cold venom.\\r\\n104\\r\\n\"Come ... come to me.... Let me rip you.... Let me tear you .... Let me kill you . .\\r\\n. .\"\\r\\nHarry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica\\r\\nSmethley\\'s street.\\r\\n\"What?\" he said loudly.\\r\\n\"I know!\" said Lockhart. \"Six solid months at the top of the bestseller\\r\\nlist! Broke all records!\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry frantically. \"That voice!\"\\r\\n\"Sorry?\" said Lockhart, looking puzzled. \"What voice?\"\\r\\n\"That - that voice that said - didn\\'t you hear it?\"\\r\\nLockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment.\\r\\n* 3-2o *\\r\\n\"What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you\\'re getting a litde\\r\\ndrowsy? Great Scott - look at the time! We\\'ve been here nearly four\\r\\nhours! Id never have believed it - the time\\'s flown, hasn\\'t it?\"\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t answer. He was straining his ears to hear the voice again,\\r\\nbut there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn\\'t\\r\\nexpect a treat like this every time he got detention. Feeling dazed,\\r\\nHarry left.\\r\\nIt was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty.\\r\\nHarry went straight up to the dormitory. Ron wasn\\'t back yet. Harry\\r\\npulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, Ron\\r\\narrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into\\r\\nthe darkened room.\\r\\n\"My muscles have all seized up,\" he groaned, sinking on his bed.\\r\\n\"Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch cup before he was\\r\\nsatisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award\\r\\nfor Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off... How was\\r\\nit with Lockhart?\"\\r\\n105\\r\\nKeeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Seamus,\\r\\nHarry told Ron exactly what he had heard.\\r\\n\"And Lockhart said he couldn\\'t hear it?\" said Ron. Harry could see\\r\\nhim frowning in the moonlight. \"D\\'you think he was lying? But I don\\'t\\r\\nget it - even someone invisible would\\'ve had to open the door.\"\\r\\n\"I know,\" said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the\\r\\ncanopy above him. \"I don\\'t get it either.\"\\r\\n* 12-1 *\\r\\n122\\r\\nOctober arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle.\\r\\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among\\r\\nthe staff and students. Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left\\r\\nthe drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley,\\r\\nwho had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The\\r\\nsteam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole\\r\\nhead was on fire.\\r\\nRaindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on\\r\\nend; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid\\'s\\r\\npumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood\\'s enthusiasm for\\r\\nregular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry\\r\\nwas to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before\\r\\nHalloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and\\r\\nsplattered with mud..\\r\\n123\\r\\nEven aside from the rain and wind it hadn\\'t been a happy practice session.\\r\\nFred and George, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for\\r\\nthemselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They\\r\\nreported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs,\\r\\nshooting through the air like missiles.\\r\\nAs Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody\\r\\nwho looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost\\r\\nof Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering\\r\\nunder his breath, \". . . don\\'t fulfill their requirements . . . half an inch, if that .\\r\\n. .\"\\r\\n\"Hello, Nick,\" said Harry.\\r\\n106\\r\\n\"Hello, hello,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He\\r\\nwore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff,\\r\\nwhich concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He\\r\\nwas pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky\\r\\nand torrential rain outside.\\r\\n\"You look troubled, young Potter,\" said Nick, folding a transparent letter as\\r\\nhe spoke and tucking it inside his doublet.\\r\\n\"So do you,\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Ah,\" Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, \"a matter of no\\r\\nimportance. . . . It\\'s not as though I really wanted to join. . . . Thought I\\'d\\r\\napply, but apparently I \\'don\\'t fulfill requirements\\' -\"\\r\\nIn spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.\\r\\n\"But you would think, wouldn\\'t you,\" he erupted suddenly, pulling the letter\\r\\nback out of his pocket, \"that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a\\r\\nblunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?\"\\r\\n124\\r\\n\"Oh - yes,\" said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree.\\r\\n\"I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean,\\r\\nand my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great\\r\\ndeal of pain and ridicule. However -\" Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter\\r\\nopen and read furiously: \"\\'We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have\\r\\nparted company with their bodies. You will appreciate that it would be\\r\\nimpossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as\\r\\nHorseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret,\\r\\ntherefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements.\\r\\nWith very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.\\'\"\\r\\nFuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away.\\r\\n\"Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people\\r\\nwould think that\\'s good and beheaded, but oh, no, it\\'s not enough for Sir\\r\\nProperly Decapitated-Podmore.\"\\r\\nNearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far\\r\\ncalmer tone, \"So - what\\'s bothering you? Anything I can do?\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"Not unless you know where we can get seven free\\r\\nNimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly -\"\\r\\nThe rest of Harry\\'s sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling\\r\\nfrom somewhere near his ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing\\r\\ninto a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat\\r\\nwho was used by the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his\\r\\nendless battle against students.\\r\\n\"You\\'d better get out of here, Harry,\" said Nick quickly. \"Filch isn\\'t in a\\r\\n107\\r\\ngood mood - he\\'s got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog\\r\\nbrains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He\\'s been cleaning all morning,\\r\\nand if he sees you dripping mud all over the place -\"\\r\\n.125\\r\\n\"Right,\" said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris,\\r\\nbut not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that\\r\\nseemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through\\r\\na tapestry to Harry\\'s right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-breaker.\\r\\nThere was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose\\r\\nwas unusually purple.\\r\\n\"Filth!\" he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he\\r\\npointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry\\'s Quidditch robes.\\r\\n\"Mess and muck everywhere! I\\'ve had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me,\\r\\nPotter!\"\\r\\nSo Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed\\r\\nFilch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the\\r\\nfloor.\\r\\nHarry had never been inside Filch\\'s office before; it was a place most\\r\\nstudents avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil\\r\\nlamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about\\r\\nthe place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels,\\r\\nHarry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever\\r\\npunished. Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A\\r\\nhighly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind\\r\\nFilch\\'s desk. It was common knowledge that he was always begging\\r\\nDumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.\\r\\nFilch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around\\r\\nlooking for parchment.\\r\\n\"Dung,\" he muttered furiously, \"great sizzling dragon bogies . . . frog brains\\r\\n. . . rat intestines . . . I\\'ve had enough of it . . . make an example . . . where\\'s\\r\\nthe form . . . yes . . .\"\\r\\n.126\\r\\nHe retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it\\r\\nout in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot.\\r\\n\"Name . . . Harry Potter. Crime . . .\"\\r\\n\"It was only a bit of mud!\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"It\\'s only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it\\'s an extra hour scrubbing!\"\\r\\nshouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose.\\r\\n\"Crime . . . befouling the castle . . . suggested sentence . . .\"\\r\\nDabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry who\\r\\n108\\r\\nwaited with bated breath for his sentence to fall.\\r\\nBut as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of\\r\\nthe office, which made the oil lamp rattle.\\r\\n\"PEEVES!\" Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage. \"I\\'ll\\r\\nhave you this time, I\\'ll have you!\"\\r\\nAnd without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the\\r\\noffice, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him.\\r\\nPeeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to\\r\\ncause havoc and distress. Harry didn\\'t much like Peeves, but couldn\\'t help\\r\\nfeeling grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and it\\r\\nsounded as though he\\'d wrecked something very big this time) would\\r\\ndistract Filch from Harry.\\r\\nThinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank\\r\\ninto a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart\\r\\nfrom his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver\\r\\nlettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch\\r\\nwasn\\'t on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read: kwikspell A\\r\\nCorrespondence Course in Beginners\\' Magic.\\r\\n127\\r\\nIntrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of\\r\\nparchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said: Feel out\\r\\nof step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not to\\r\\nperform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork? There\\r\\nis an answer! Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn\\r\\ncourse. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell\\r\\nmethod! Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: \"I had no memory for\\r\\nincantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell\\r\\ncourse, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of\\r\\nmy Scintillation Solution!\" Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: \"My wife\\r\\nused to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous\\r\\nKwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak! Thank you,\\r\\nKwikspell!\"\\r\\nFascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope\\'s contents. Why\\r\\non earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn\\'t a\\r\\nproper wizard? Harry was just reading \"Lesson One: Holding Your Wand\\r\\n(Some Useful Tips)\" when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was\\r\\ncoming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it\\r\\nback onto the desk just as the door opened.\\r\\nFilch was looking triumphant.\\r\\n\"That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!\" he was saying gleefully to\\r\\nMrs. Norris. \"We\\'ll have Peeves out this time, my sweet -\"\\r\\n109\\r\\nHis eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which,\\r\\nHarry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started.\\r\\nFilch\\'s pasty face went brick red. Harry braced himself for a tidal wave of\\r\\nfury. Filch hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it\\r\\ninto a drawer.\\r\\n\"Have you - did you read -?\" he sputtered.\\r\\n.128\\r\\n\"No,\" Harry lied quickly.\\r\\nFilch\\'s knobbly hands were twisting together.\\r\\n\"If I thought you\\'d read my private - not that it\\'s mine - for a friend - be that\\r\\nas it may - however -\"\\r\\nHarry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder. His eyes\\r\\nwere popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan\\r\\nscarf didn\\'t help.\\r\\n\"Very well - go - and don\\'t breathe a word - not that - however, if you didn\\'t\\r\\nread - go now, I have to write up Peeves\\' report - go -\"\\r\\nAmazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back\\r\\nupstairs. To escape from Filch\\'s office without punishment was probably\\r\\nsome kind of school record.\\r\\n\"Harry! Harry! Did it work?\"\\r\\nNearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. Behind him, Harry\\r\\ncould see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to\\r\\nhave been dropped from a great height.\\r\\n\"I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch\\'s office,\" said Nick eagerly.\\r\\n\"Thought it might distract him -\"\\r\\n\"Was that you?\" said Harry gratefully. \"Yeah, it worked, I didn\\'t even get\\r\\ndetention. Thanks, Nick!\"\\r\\nThey set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed,\\r\\nwas still holding Sir Patrick\\'s rejection letter..\\r\\n129\\r\\n\"I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,\"\\r\\nHarry said.\\r\\nNearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right through\\r\\nhim. He wished he hadn\\'t; it was like stepping through an icy shower.\\r\\n\"But there is something you could do for me,\" said Nick excitedly. \"Harry -\\r\\nwould I be asking too much - but no, you wouldn\\'t want -\"\\r\\n\"What is it?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,\" said Nearly\\r\\nHeadless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified.\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this.\\r\\n110\\r\\n\"Right.\"\\r\\n\"I\\'m holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be\\r\\ncoming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would\\r\\nattend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, of\\r\\ncourse - but I daresay you\\'d rather go to the school feast?\" He watched Harry\\r\\non tenterhooks.\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry quickly, \"I\\'ll come -\"\\r\\n\"My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! And\" - he hesitated,\\r\\nlooking excited - \"do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick\\r\\nhow very frightening and impressive you find me?\"\\r\\n\"Of - of course,\" said Harry.\\r\\nNearly Headless Nick beamed at him. \"A deathday party?\" said Hermione\\r\\nkeenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in the\\r\\ncommon room. \"I bet there aren\\'t many living people who can say they\\'ve\\r\\nbeen to one of those - it\\'ll be fascinating!\".\\r\\n130\\r\\n\"Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?\" said Ron, who\\r\\nwas halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy. \"Sounds dead\\r\\ndepressing to me. . . .\"\\r\\nRain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside\\r\\nall looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countless\\r\\nsquashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in\\r\\nthe case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen\\r\\nif you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had \"rescued\" the\\r\\nbrilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class\\r\\nand it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of\\r\\ncurious people.\\r\\nHarry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the\\r\\nKwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air,\\r\\nemitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The\\r\\nsight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular\\r\\ndisplay of tangerine stars showering from the salamander\\'s mouth, and its\\r\\nescape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the\\r\\nKwikspell envelope from Harry\\'s mind. By the time Halloween arrived,\\r\\nHarry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest of\\r\\nthe school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had\\r\\nbeen decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid\\'s vast pumpkins had been\\r\\ncarved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were\\r\\nrumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the\\r\\nentertainment.\\r\\n\"A promise is a promise,\" Hermione reminded Harry bossily. \"You said\\r\\n111\\r\\nyou\\'d go to the deathday party.\"\\r\\nSo at seven o\\'clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the\\r\\ndoorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold\\r\\nplates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons.\\r\\n.131\\r\\nThe passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick\\'s party had been lined\\r\\nwith candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long,\\r\\nthin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light\\r\\neven over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step\\r\\nthey took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he\\r\\nheard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous\\r\\nblackboard.\\r\\n\"Is that supposed to be music?\" Ron whispered. They turned a corner and\\r\\nsaw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet\\r\\ndrapes.\\r\\n\"My dear friends,\" he said mournfully. \"Welcome, welcome . . . so pleased\\r\\nyou could come. . . .\"\\r\\nHe swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside.\\r\\nIt was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white,\\r\\ntranslucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor,\\r\\nwaltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by\\r\\nan orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead\\r\\nblazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose\\r\\nin a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer.\\r\\n\"Shall we have a look around?\" Harry suggested, wanting to warm up his\\r\\nfeet.\\r\\n\"Careful not to walk through anyone,\" said Ron nervously, and they set off\\r\\naround the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a\\r\\nragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost,\\r\\nwho was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry\\r\\nwasn\\'t surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin\\r\\nghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the\\r\\nother ghosts.\\r\\n.132\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said Hermione, stopping abruptly. \"Turn back, turn back, I don\\'t\\r\\nwant to talk to Moaning Myrtle -\"\\r\\n\"Who?\" said Harry as they backtracked quickly.\\r\\n\"She haunts one of the toilets in the girls\\' bathroom on the first floor,\" said\\r\\nHermione.\\r\\n\"She haunts a toilet?\"\\r\\n112\\r\\n\"Yes. It\\'s been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and\\r\\nflooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it\\'s awful\\r\\ntrying to have a pee with her wailing at you -\"\\r\\n\"Look, food!\" said Ron.\\r\\nOn the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black\\r\\nvelvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their\\r\\ntracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish were laid\\r\\non handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on\\r\\nsalvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry\\r\\ngreen mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a\\r\\ntombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-\\r\\nPorpington\\r\\ndied 31st October, 1492\\r\\nHarry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched\\r\\nlow, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through\\r\\none of the stinking salmon.\\r\\n\"Can you taste it if you walk though it?\" Harry asked him.\\r\\n\"Almost,\" said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away.\\r\\n.133\\r\\n\"I expect they\\'ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,\" said Hermione\\r\\nknowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid\\r\\nhaggis.\\r\\n\"Can we move? I feel sick,\" said Ron.\\r\\nThey had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped\\r\\nsuddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them.\\r\\n\"Hello, Peeves,\" said Harry cautiously.\\r\\nUnlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse\\r\\nof pale and transparent. He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a\\r\\nrevolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face.\\r\\n\"Nibbles?\" he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in\\r\\nfungus.\\r\\n\"No thanks,\" said Hermione.\\r\\n\"Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,\" said Peeves, his eyes dancing.\\r\\n\"Rude you was about poor Myrtle.\" He took a deep breath and bellowed,\\r\\n\"OY! MYRTLE!\"\\r\\n\"Oh, no, Peeves, don\\'t tell her what I said, she\\'ll be really upset,\" Hermione\\r\\nwhispered frantically. \"I didn\\'t mean it, I don\\'t mind her - er, hello, Myrtle.\"\\r\\nThe squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face Harry\\r\\nhad ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.\\r\\n\"What?\" she said sulkily.\\r\\n\"How are you, Myrtle?\" said Hermione in a falsely bright voice. \"It\\'s nice to\\r\\n113\\r\\nsee you out of the toilet.\"\\r\\n.134\\r\\nMyrtle sniffed.\\r\\n\"Miss Granger was just talking about you -\" said Peeves slyly in Myrtle\\'s\\r\\near.\\r\\n\"Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight,\" said Hermione, glaring\\r\\nat Peeves.\\r\\nMyrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously.\\r\\n\"You\\'re making fun of me,\" she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her\\r\\nsmall, see-through eyes.\\r\\n\"No - honestly - didn\\'t I just say how nice Myrtle\\'s looking?\" said\\r\\nHermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs.\\r\\n\"Oh, yeah -\"\\r\\n\"She did -\"\\r\\n\"Don\\'t lie to me,\" Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down her face, while\\r\\nPeeves chuckled happily over her shoulder. \"D\\'you think I don\\'t know what\\r\\npeople call me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle! Miserable,\\r\\nmoaning, moping Myrtle!\"\\r\\n\"You\\'ve forgotten pimply,\" Peeves hissed in her ear.\\r\\nMoaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon.\\r\\nPeeves shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, \"Pimply!\\r\\nPimply!\"\\r\\n\"Oh, dear,\" said Hermione sadly.\\r\\nNearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd.\\r\\n.135\\r\\n\"Enjoying yourselves?\"\\r\\n\"Oh, yes,\" they lied.\\r\\n\"Not a bad turnout,\" said Nearly Headless Nick proudly. \"The Wailing\\r\\nWidow came all the way up from Kent. . . . It\\'s nearly time for my speech,\\r\\nI\\'d better go and warn the orchestra. . . .\"\\r\\nThe orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. They, and\\r\\neveryone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a\\r\\nhunting horn sounded.\\r\\n\"Oh, here we go,\" said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly.\\r\\nThrough the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a\\r\\nheadless horseman. The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too,\\r\\nbut stopped quickly at the sight of Nick\\'s face.\\r\\nThe horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing\\r\\nand plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his\\r\\nbearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the horn.\\r\\n114\\r\\nThe ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the\\r\\ncrowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick,\\r\\nsquashing his head back onto his neck.\\r\\n\"Nick!\" he roared. \"How are you? Head still hanging in there?\"\\r\\nHe gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder.\\r\\n\"Welcome, Patrick,\" said Nick stiffly.\\r\\n\"Live \\'uns!\" said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving\\r\\na huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd\\r\\nhowled with laughter).\\r\\n.136\\r\\n\"Very amusing,\" said Nearly Headless Nick darkly.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t mind Nick!\" shouted Sir Patrick\\'s head from the floor. \"Still upset we\\r\\nwon\\'t let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say - look at the fellow -\"\\r\\n\"I think,\" said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, \"Nick\\'s very\\r\\n- frightening and - er -\"\\r\\n\"Ha!\" yelled Sir Patrick\\'s head. \"Bet he asked you to say that!\"\\r\\n\"If I could have everyone\\'s attention, it\\'s time for my speech!\" said Nearly\\r\\nHeadless Nick loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy\\r\\nblue spotlight.\\r\\n\"My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow . . .\"\\r\\nBut nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt\\r\\nhad just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to\\r\\nwatch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his audience, but gave\\r\\nup as Sir Patrick\\'s head went sailing past him to loud cheers.\\r\\nHarry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry.\\r\\n\"I can\\'t stand much more of this,\" Ron muttered, his teeth chattering, as the\\r\\norchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance\\r\\nfloor.\\r\\n\"Let\\'s go,\" Harry agreed.\\r\\nThey backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked\\r\\nat them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of\\r\\nblack candles.\\r\\n\"Pudding might not be finished yet,\" said Ron hopefully, leading the way\\r\\ntoward the steps to the entrance hall.\\r\\n.137\\r\\nAnd then Harry heard it.\\r\\n\". . . rip . . . tear . . . kill . . .\"\\r\\nIt was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in\\r\\nLockhart\\'s office.\\r\\nHe stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his\\r\\n115\\r\\nmight, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway.\\r\\n\"Harry, what\\'re you -?\"\\r\\n\"It\\'s that voice again - shut up a minute -\"\\r\\n\". . . soo hungry . . . for so long . . .\"\\r\\n\"Listen!\" said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching him.\\r\\n\". . . kill . . . time to kill . . .\"\\r\\nThe voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was moving away -\\r\\nmoving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared\\r\\nat the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, to\\r\\nwhom stone ceilings didn\\'t matter?\\r\\n\"This way,\" he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance\\r\\nhall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the\\r\\nHalloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. Harry sprinted up the\\r\\nmarble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him.\\r\\n\"Harry, what\\'re we -\"\\r\\n\"SHH!\"\\r\\n.138\\r\\nHarry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter\\r\\nstill, he heard the voice: \". . . I smell blood. . . . I SMELL BLOOD!\"\\r\\nHis stomach lurched -\\r\\n\"It\\'s going to kill someone!\" he shouted, and ignoring Ron\\'s and Hermione\\'s\\r\\nbewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to\\r\\nlisten over his own pounding footsteps -\\r\\nHarry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione\\r\\npanting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last,\\r\\ndeserted passage.\\r\\n\"Harry, what was that all about?\" said Ron, wiping sweat off his face. \"I\\r\\ncouldn\\'t hear anything. . . .\"\\r\\nBut Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor.\\r\\n\"Look!\"\\r\\nSomething was shining on the wall ahead. They approached slowly,\\r\\nsquinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the\\r\\nwall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming\\r\\ntorches. the chamber of secrets has been opened. enemies of the heir,\\r\\nbeware.\\r\\n\"What\\'s that thing - hanging underneath?\" said Ron, a slight quiver in his\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\nAs they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped - there was a large puddle of\\r\\nwater on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward\\r\\nthe message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All three of them\\r\\nrealized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash..Mrs. Norris,\\r\\n116\\r\\nthe caretaker\\'s cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch\\r\\nbracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring.\\r\\nFor a few seconds, they didn\\'t move. Then Ron said, \"Let\\'s get out of here.\"\\r\\n\"Shouldn\\'t we try and help -\" Harry began awkwardly.\\r\\n\"Trust me,\" said Ron. \"We don\\'t want to be found here.\"\\r\\nBut it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that\\r\\nthe feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stood\\r\\ncame the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy\\r\\ntalk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the\\r\\npassage from both ends.\\r\\nThe chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted\\r\\nthe hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the\\r\\ncorridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see\\r\\nthe grisly sight.\\r\\nThen someone shouted through the quiet.\\r\\n\"Enemies of the Heir, beware! You\\'ll be next, Mudbloods!\"\\r\\nIt was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes\\r\\nalive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the\\r\\nhanging, immobile cat.\\r\\nC H A P T X IR N I N E\\r\\nTHE WRTITING\\r\\nON THE WALL\\r\\nWhat\\'s going on here? What\\'s going on?\" Attracted no doubt by\\r\\nMalfoy\\'s shout, Argus Filch came shouldering his way through the\\r\\ncrowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face in\\r\\nhorror.\\r\\n\"My cat! My cat! What\\'s happened to Mrs. Norris?\" he shrieked.\\r\\nAnd his popping eyes fell on Harry.\\r\\n\"You!\"he screeched. \"You! You\\'ve murdered my cat! You\\'ve\\r\\nkilled her! I\\'ll kill you! I\\'ll -\"\\r\\n\"Argus!\"\\r\\nDumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other\\r\\n117\\r\\nteachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, and Hermione\\r\\nand detached Mrs. Norris from the torch bracket.\\r\\n\"Come with me, Argus,\" he said to Filch. \"You, too, Mr. Potter, Mr.\\r\\nWeasley, Miss Granger.\"\\r\\nLockhart stepped forward eagerly.\\r\\n*140*\\r\\n\"My office is nearest, Headmaster - just upstairs - please feel free -\"\\r\\n\"Thank you, Gilderoy,\" said Dumbledore.\\r\\nThe silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockhart, looking excited and\\r\\nimportant, hurried after Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall\\r\\nand Snape.\\r\\nAs they entered Lockhart\\'s darkened office there was a flurry of\\r\\nmovement across the walls; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in the\\r\\npictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. The real Lockhart lit\\r\\nthe candles on his desk and stood back. Dumbledore lay Mrs. Norris\\r\\non the polished surface and began to examine her. Harry, Ron, and\\r\\nHermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool\\r\\nof candlelight, watching.\\r\\nThe tip of Dumbledore\\'s long, crooked nose was barely an inch from\\r\\nMrs. Norris\\'s fur. He was looking at her closely through his half-moon\\r\\nspectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking. Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed. Snape\\r\\nloomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar\\r\\nexpression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile. And\\r\\nLockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions.\\r\\n\"It was definitely a curse that killed her - probably the Transmogrifian\\r\\nTorture - I\\'ve seen it used many times, so unlucky I wasn\\'t there, I\\r\\nknow the very countercurse that would have saved her . .....\\r\\nLockhart\\'s comments were punctuated by Filch\\'s dry, racking sobs.\\r\\nHe was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris,\\r\\n118\\r\\nhis face in his hands. Much as he detested Filch, Harry\\r\\n*141*\\r\\ncouldn\\'t help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as\\r\\nhe felt for himself If Dumbledore believed Filch, he would be expelled\\r\\nfor sure.\\r\\nDumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and\\r\\ntapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but nothing happened: She\\r\\ncontinued to look as though she had been recently stuffed.\\r\\n\". . . I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou,\"\\r\\nsaid Lockhart, \"a series of attacks, the full story\\'s in my\\r\\nautobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with various\\r\\namulets, which cleared the matter up at once ......\\r\\nThe photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in\\r\\nagreement as he talked. One of them had forgotten to remove his hair\\r\\nnet.\\r\\nAt last Dumbledore straightened up.\\r\\n\"She\\'s not dead, Argus,\" he said softly.\\r\\nLockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of\\r\\nmurders he had prevented.\\r\\n\"Not dead?\" choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris.\\r\\n\"But why\\'s she all - all stiff and frozen?\"\\r\\n\"She has been Petrified,\" said Dumbledore (\"Ah! I thought so!\" said\\r\\nLockhart). \"But how, I cannot say . . . .\"\\r\\n\"Ask him!\" shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face to\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\n\"No second year could have done this,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"it\\r\\nwould take Dark Magic of the most advanced -\"\\r\\n\"He did it, he did it!\" Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling. \"You saw\\r\\nwhat he wrote on the wall! He found - in my office - he knows I\\'m a -\\r\\n119\\r\\nI\\'m a -\" Filch\\'s face worked horribly. \"He knows I\\'m a Squib!\" he\\r\\nfinished.\\r\\n142\\r\\n\"I never touched Mrs. Norris!\" Harry said loudly, uncomfortably\\r\\naware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the\\r\\nwalls. \"And I don\\'t even know what a Squib is.\"\\r\\n\"Rubbish!\" snarled Filch. \"He saw my Kwikspell letter!\"\\r\\n\"If I might speak, Headmaster,\" said Snape from the shadows, and\\r\\nHarry\\'s sense of forboding increased; he was sure nothing Snape had\\r\\nto say was going to do him any good.\\r\\n\"Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the\\r\\nwrong time,\" he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he\\r\\ndoubted it. \"But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here.\\r\\nWhy was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn\\'t he at the\\r\\nHalloween feast?\"\\r\\nHarry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the\\r\\ndeathday party. \". . . there were hundreds of ghosts, theyll tell you we were\\r\\nthere -\"\\r\\n\"But why not join the feast afterward?\" said Snape, his black eyes\\r\\nglittering in the candlelight. \"Why go up to that corridor?\"\\r\\nRon and Hermione looked at Harry.\\r\\n\"Because - because -\" Harry said, his heart thumping very fast;\\r\\nsomething told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he\\r\\nhad been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear,\\r\\n\"because we were tired and wanted to go to bed,\" he said.\\r\\n\"Without any supper?\" said Snape, a triumphant smile flickering across\\r\\nhis gaunt face. \"I didn\\'t think ghosts provided food fit for living people\\r\\nat their parties.\"\\r\\n\"We weren\\'t hungry,\" said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge\\r\\nrumble.\\r\\n120\\r\\nSnape\\'s nasty smile widened.\\r\\n*143*\\r\\n\"I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful,\" he\\r\\nsaid. \"It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges\\r\\nuntil he is ready to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should\\r\\nbe taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be\\r\\nhonest.\"\\r\\n\"Really, Severus,\" said Professor McGonagall sharply, \"I see no\\r\\nreason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn\\'t hit over the\\r\\nhead with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter has\\r\\ndone anything wrong.\"\\r\\nDumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His twinkling lightblue\\r\\ngaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed.\\r\\n\"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus,\" he said firmly.\\r\\nSnape looked furious. So did Filch.\\r\\n\"My cat has been Petrified!\" he shrieked, his eyes popping. \"I want to\\r\\nsee some punishment!\"\\r\\n\"We will be able to cure her, Argus,\" said Dumbledore patiently.\\r\\n\"Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As\\r\\nsoon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that\\r\\nwill revive Mrs. Norris.\"\\r\\n\"I\\'ll make it,\" Lockhart butted in. \"I must have done it a hundred times.\\r\\nI could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep -\"\\r\\n\"Excuse me,\" said Snape icily. \"But I believe I am the Potions master\\r\\nat this school.\"\\r\\nThere was a very awkward pause.\\r\\n\"You may go,\" Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\\r\\nThey went, as quickly as they could without actually running. When\\r\\nthey were a floor up from Lockhart\\'s office, they turned into\\r\\n121\\r\\n*144*\\r\\nan empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. Harry\\r\\nsquinted at his friends\\' darkened faces.\\r\\n\"D\\'you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Ron, without hesitation. \"Hearing voices no one else can\\r\\nhear isn\\'t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\"\\r\\nSomething in Ron\\'s voice made Harry ask, \"You do believe me, don\\'t\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\"\\'Course I do,\" said Ron quickly. \"But -you must admit it\\'s weird ......\\r\\n\"I know it\\'s weird,\" said Harry. \"The whole thing\\'s weird. What was\\r\\nthat writing on the wall about? The Cbamber Has Been Opened...\\r\\nWhat\\'s that supposed to mean?\"\\r\\n\"You know, it rings a sort of bell,\" said Ron slowly. \"I think someone\\r\\ntold me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once ... might\\'ve\\r\\nbeen Bill . . . .\"\\r\\n\"And what on earth\\'s a Squib?\" said Harry.\\r\\nTo his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger.\\r\\n\"Well - it\\'s not funny really - but as it\\'s Filch, he said. \"A Squib is\\r\\nsomeone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn\\'t got any\\r\\nmagic powers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but\\r\\nSquibs are quite unusual. If Filch\\'s trying to learn magic from a\\r\\nKwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would explain a lot.\\r\\nLike why he hates students so much.\" Ron gave a satisfied smile.\\r\\n\"He\\'s bitter.\"\\r\\nA clock chimed somewhere.\\r\\n\"Midnight,\" said Harry. \"We\\'d better get to bed before Snape comes\\r\\nalong and tries to frame us for something else.\"\\r\\n*145*\\r\\n122\\r\\nFor a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on\\r\\nMrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in everyone\\'s minds by pacing the spot\\r\\nwhere she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might\\r\\ncome back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall\\r\\nwith Mrs. Skower\\'s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no\\r\\neffect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When\\r\\nFilch wasn\\'t guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking redeyed\\r\\nthrough the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and\\r\\ntrying to put them in detention for things like \"breathing loudly\\' and\\r\\n\"looking happy.\"\\r\\nGinny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris\\'s fate.\\r\\nAccording to Ron, she was a great cat lover.\\r\\n\"But you haven\\'t really got to know Mrs. Norris,\" Ron told her\\r\\nbracingly. \"Honestly, we\\'re much better off without her.\" Ginny\\'s lip\\r\\ntrembled. \"Stuff like this doesn\\'t often happen at Hogwarts,\" Ron\\r\\nassured her. \"They\\'ll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of\\r\\nhere in no time. I just hope he\\'s got time to Petrify Filch before he\\'s\\r\\nexpelled. I\\'m only joking -\" Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched.\\r\\nThe attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was quite usual for\\r\\nHermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doing\\r\\nalmost nothing else. Nor could Harry and Ron get much response\\r\\nfrom her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the\\r\\nfollowing Wednesday did they find out.\\r\\nHarry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay\\r\\nbehind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, he\\r\\nwent upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch-\\r\\nFletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming\\r\\n*146*\\r\\ntoward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin\\r\\ncaught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite\\r\\ndirection.\\r\\nHarry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of\\r\\n123\\r\\nMagic homework. Professor Binns had asked for a threefoot-long\\r\\ncomposition on \"The Medieval Assembly of European\\r\\nWizards.\"\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe it, I\\'m still eight inches short said Ron fu\\r\\nriously, letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll.\\r\\n\"And Hermione\\'s done four feet seven inches and her writing\\'s\\r\\ntiny. \"\\r\\n\"Where is she?\" asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling\\r\\nhis own homework.\\r\\n\"Somewhere over there,\" said Ron, pointing along the shelves. \"Looking\\r\\nfor another book. I think she\\'s trying to read the whole library before\\r\\nChristmas.\"\\r\\nHarry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him.\\r\\n\"Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an idiot,\" said Ron,\\r\\nscribbling away, making his writing as large as possible. \"All that junk\\r\\nabout Lockhart being so great -\"\\r\\nHermione emerged from between the bookshelves. She looked irritable\\r\\nand at last seemed ready to talk to them.\\r\\n\"All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,\" she said,\\r\\nsitting down next to Harry and Ron. \"And there\\'s a two-week waiting\\r\\nlist. I wish I hadn\\'t left my copy at home, but I couldn\\'t fit it in my trunk\\r\\nwith all the Lockhart books.\"\\r\\n\"Why do you want it?\" said Harry.\\r\\n*141*\\r\\n\"The same reason everyone else wants it,\" said Hermione, \"to read\\r\\nup on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.\"\\r\\n\"What\\'s that?\" said Harry quickly.\\r\\n\"That\\'s just it. I can\\'t remember,\" said Hermione, biting her lip. \"And\\r\\nI can\\'t find the story anywhere else -\"\\r\\n124\\r\\n\"Hermione, let me read your composition,\" said Ron desperately,\\r\\nchecking his watch.\\r\\n\"No, I won\\'t,\" said Hermione, suddenly severe. \"You\\'ve had ten\\r\\ndays to finish it -\"\\r\\n\"I only need another two inches, come on -\"\\r\\nThe bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic,\\r\\nbickering.\\r\\nHistory of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. Professor\\r\\nBinns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most\\r\\nexciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the\\r\\nroom through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled, many people\\r\\nsaid he hadn\\'t noticed he was dead. He had simply got up to teach\\r\\none day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the\\r\\nstaff room fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since.\\r\\nToday was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened his notes and\\r\\nbegan to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly\\r\\neveryone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to\\r\\nlong enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again.\\r\\nHe had been speaking for half an hour when something happened\\r\\nthat had never happened before. Hermione put up her hand.\\r\\nProfessor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lec\\r\\n*148*\\r\\nture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed.\\r\\n\"Miss - er -?\"\\r\\n\"Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anything\\r\\nabout the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Hermione in a clear voice.\\r\\nDean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open,\\r\\ngazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown\\'s\\r\\nhead came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom\\'s elbow slipped\\r\\noff his desk.\\r\\n125\\r\\nProfessor Binns blinked.\\r\\n\"My subject is History of Magic,\" he said in his dry, wheezy voice. \"I\\r\\ndeal with facts, Miss Granger, not myths and legends.\" He cleared his\\r\\nthroat with a small noise like chalk s!-ping and continued, \"In\\r\\nSeptember of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers\\r\\n\"\\r\\nHe stuttered to a halt. Hermione\\'s hand was waving in the air again.\\r\\n\"Miss Grant?\"\\r\\n\"Please, sir, don\\'t legends always have a basis in fact?\"\\r\\nProfessor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, Harry was\\r\\nsure no student had ever interrupted him before, alive or dead.\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Professor Binns slowly, \"yes, one could argue that, I\\r\\nsuppose.\" He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a\\r\\nstudent properly before. \"However, the legend of which you speak is\\r\\nsuch a very sensational, even ludicrous tale -\"\\r\\nBut the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns\\'s every\\r\\nword. He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry\\r\\n*149*\\r\\ncould tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of\\r\\ninterest.\\r\\n\"Oh, very well,\" he said slowly. \"Let me see ... the Chamber of\\r\\nSecrets ...\\r\\n\"You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand\\r\\nyears ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches\\r\\nand wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after\\r\\nthem: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and\\r\\nSalazar Slytherin. They built this castle together, far from prying\\r\\nMuggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common\\r\\npeople, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.\"\\r\\n126\\r\\nHe paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.\\r\\n\"For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking\\r\\nout youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the\\r\\ncastle to be educated. But then disagreements sprang up between\\r\\nthem. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin\\r\\nwished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He\\r\\nbelieved that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.\\r\\nHe disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be\\r\\nuntrustworthy. After a while, there was a serious argument on the\\r\\nsubject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left the\\r\\nschool.\"\\r\\nProfessor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled\\r\\nold tortoise.\\r\\n\"Reliable historical sources tell us this much,\" he said. \"But these\\r\\nhonest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the\\r\\nChamber of Secrets. The story goes that Slytherin had built a\\r\\n*150*\\r\\nhidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew\\r\\nnothing.\\r\\n\"Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets\\r\\nso that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at\\r\\nthe school. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of\\r\\nSecrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of\\r\\nall who were unworthy to study magic.\"\\r\\nThere was silence as he finished telling the story, but it wasn\\'t the\\r\\nusual, sleepy silence that filled Professor Binns\\'s classes. There was\\r\\nunease in the air as everyone continued to watch him, hoping for\\r\\nmore. Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed.\\r\\n\"The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,\" he said. \"Naturally,\\r\\nthe school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, many\\r\\ntimes, by the most learned witches and wizards. It does not exist. A\\r\\ntale told to frighten the gullible.\"\\r\\n127\\r\\nHermione\\'s hand was back in the air.\\r\\n\"Sir - what exactly do you mean by the `horror within\\' the\\r\\nChamber?\"\\r\\n\"That is believed to be some sort of monster, which the Heir of\\r\\nSlytherin alone can control,\" said Professor Binns in his dry, reedy\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\nThe class exchanged nervous looks.\\r\\n\"I tell you, the thing does not exist,\" said Professor Binns, shuffling his\\r\\nnotes. \"There is no Chamber and no monster.\"\\r\\n\"But, sir,\" said Seamus Finnigan, \"if the Chamber can only be opened\\r\\nby Slytherin\\'s true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would\\r\\nthey?\"\\r\\n\"Nonsense, O\\'Flaherty,\" said Professor Binns in an aggravated\\r\\n*151*\\r\\ntone. \"If a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and\\r\\nheadmistresses haven\\'t found the thing -\"\\r\\n\"But, Professor,\" piped up Parvati Patil, \"you\\'d probably have to use\\r\\nDark Magic to open it -\"\\r\\n\"Just because a wizard doesn\\'t use Dark Magic doesn\\'t mean he\\r\\ncan\\'t, Miss Pennyfeather,\" snapped Professor Binns. \"I repeat, if the\\r\\nlikes of Dumbledore -\"\\r\\n\"But maybe you\\'ve got to be related to Slytherin, so Dumbledore\\r\\ncouldn\\'t -\" began Dean Thomas, but Professor Binns had had\\r\\nenough.\\r\\n\"That will do,\" he said sharply. \"It is a myth! It does not exist! There\\r\\nis not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a\\r\\nsecret broom cupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! We\\r\\nwill return, if you please, to history, to solid, believable, verifiable\\r\\nfact!\"\\r\\n128\\r\\nAnd within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor.\\r\\n\"I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,\" Ron told\\r\\nHarry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming\\r\\ncorridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before\\r\\ndinner. \"But I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t be in his house if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat\\r\\nhad tried to put me in Slytherin, I\\'d\\'ve got the train straight back\\r\\nhome ......\\r\\nHermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn\\'t say anything. His\\r\\nstomach had just dropped unpleasantly.\\r\\nHarry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat\\r\\n*152*\\r\\nhad seriously considered putting him in Slytherin. He could remember,\\r\\nas though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear\\r\\nwhen he\\'d placed the hat on his head a year before: You could be great,\\r\\nyou know, it\\'s all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the\\r\\nway to greatness, no doubt about that...\\r\\nBut Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House\\'s reputa\\r\\ntion for turning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, Not\\r\\nSlytherin! and the hat had said, Oh, well, if you\\'re sure ... better be\\r\\nGryffindor...\\r\\nAs they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevy went past.\\r\\n\"Hiya, Harry!\"\\r\\n\"Hullo, Colin,\" said Harry automatically.\\r\\n\"Harry - Harry - a boy in my class has been saying you\\'re\\r\\nBut Colin was so small he couldn~t fight against the tide of people\\r\\nbearing him toward the Great Hall; they heard him squeak, \"See you,\\r\\nHarry!\" and he was gone.\\r\\n\"What\\'s a boy in his class saying about you?\" Hermione wondered.\\r\\n129\\r\\n\"That I\\'m Slytherin\\'s heir, I expect,\" said Harry, his stomach dropping\\r\\nanother inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch-\\r\\nFletchley had run away from him at lunchtime.\\r\\n\"People here\\'ll believe anything,\" said Ron in disgust.\\r\\nThe crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase\\r\\nwithout difficulty.\\r\\n\"D\\'you really think there\\'s a Chamber of Secrets?\" Ron asked\\r\\nHermione.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" she said, frowning. \"Dumbledore couldn\\'t cure\\r\\n* 1,5 % *\\r\\nMrs. Norris, and that makes me think that whatever attacked her\\r\\nmight not be - well - human.\"\\r\\nAs she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the end\\r\\nof the very corridor where the attack had happened. They stopped\\r\\nand looked. The scene was just as it had been that night, except that\\r\\nthere was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an empty\\r\\nchair stood against the wall bearing the message \"The Chamber of\\r\\nSecrets has been Opened.\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s where Filch has been keeping guard,\" Ron muttered.\\r\\nThey looked at each other. The corridor was deserted.\\r\\n\"Can\\'t hurt to have a poke around,\" said Harry, dropping his bag and\\r\\ngetting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searching\\r\\nfor clues.\\r\\n\"Scorch marks!\" he said. \"Here - and here -\"\\r\\n\"Come and look at this!\" said Hermione. \"This is funny . . . .\"\\r\\nHarry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the\\r\\nwall. Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane, where around\\r\\ntwenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a\\r\\n130\\r\\nsmall crack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as though\\r\\nthey had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside.\\r\\n\"Have you ever seen spiders act like that?\" said Hermione\\r\\nwonderingly.\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry, \"have you, Ron? Ron?\"\\r\\nHe looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well back and seemed\\r\\nto be fighting the impulse to run.\\r\\n\"What\\'s up?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"I - don\\'t - like - spiders,\" said Ron tensely.\\r\\n\"I never knew that,\" said Hermione, looking at Ron in surprise.\\r\\n\"You\\'ve used spiders in Potions loads of times ......\\r\\n*154*\\r\\n\"I don\\'t mind them dead,\" said Ron, who was carefully looking\\r\\nanywhere but at the window. \"I just don\\'t like the way they move ....\\r\\nHermione giggled.\\r\\n\"It\\'s not funny,\" said Ron, fiercely. \"If you must know, when I was\\r\\nthree, Fred turned my - my teddy bear into a great big fiIthy spider\\r\\nbecause I broke his toy broomstick .... You wouldn\\'t like them either if\\r\\nyou\\'d been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and. .\\r\\n. \"\\r\\nHe broke off, shuddering. Hermione was obviously still trying not to\\r\\nlaugh. Feeling they had better get off the subject, Harry said,\\r\\n\"Remember all that water on the floor? Where did that come from?\\r\\nSomeone\\'s mopped it up.\"\\r\\n\"It was about here,\" said Ron, recovering himself to walk a few paces\\r\\npast Filch\\'s chair and pointing. \"Level with this door.\"\\r\\nHe reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as\\r\\nthough he\\'d been burned.\\r\\n131\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Can\\'t go in there,\" said Ron gruffly. \"That\\'s a girls\\' toilet.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, Ron, there won\\'t be anyone in there,\" said Hermione, standing up\\r\\nand coming over. \"That\\'s Moaning Myrtle\\'s place. Come on, let\\'s have\\r\\na look.\"\\r\\nAnd ignoring the large OUT of ORDER sign, she opened the door.\\r\\nIt was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set\\r\\nfoot in. Under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row of\\r\\nchipped sinks. The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given\\r\\noff by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders; the\\r\\nwooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of\\r\\nthem was dangling off its hinges.\\r\\n* -L 5,5\\r\\nHermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall.\\r\\nWhen she reached it she said, \"Hello, Myrtle, how are you?\"\\r\\nHarry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was floating above the\\r\\ntank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin.\\r\\n\"This is a girls\\' bathroom,\" she said, eyeing Ron and Harry suspiciously.\\r\\n\"They\\'re not girls.\"\\r\\n\"No,\" Hermione agreed. \"I just wanted to show them how er - nice it is\\r\\nin here.\"\\r\\nShe waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor.\\r\\n\"Ask her if she saw anything,\" Harry mouthed at Hermione.\\r\\n\"What are you whispering?\" said Myrtle, staring at him.\\r\\n\"Nothing,\" said Harry quickly. \"We wanted to ask -\"\\r\\n\"I wish people would stop talking behind my back!\" said Myrtle, in a\\r\\nvoice choked with tears. \"I do have feelings, you know, even if I am\\r\\ndead -\"\\r\\n132\\r\\n\"Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,\" said Hermione. \"Harry only -\"\\r\\n\"No one wants to upset me! That\\'s a good one!\" howled Myrtle. \"My\\r\\nlife was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along\\r\\nruining my death!\"\\r\\n\"We wanted to ask you if you\\'ve seen anything funny lately,\" said\\r\\nHermione quickly. \"Because a cat was attacked right outside your\\r\\nfront door on Halloween.\"\\r\\n\"Did you see anyone near here that night?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"I wasn\\'t paying attention,\" said Myrtle dramatically. \"Peeves upset me\\r\\nso much I came in here and tried to kill myself Then, of course, I\\r\\nremembered that I\\'m - that I\\'m \"\\r\\n\"Already dead,\" said Ron helpfully.\\r\\n* IL 56*\\r\\nMyrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived\\r\\nheadfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing\\r\\nfrom sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had\\r\\ncome to rest somewhere in the U-bend.\\r\\nHarry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shrugged\\r\\nwearily and said, \"Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle ....\\r\\nCome on, let\\'s go.\"\\r\\nHarry had barely closed the door on Myrtle\\'s gurgling sobs when a\\r\\nloud voice made all three of them jump.\\r\\n\"RON!\"\\r\\nPercy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefect\\r\\nbadge agleam, an expression of complete shock on his face.\\r\\n\"That\\'s a girls\\' bathroom!\" he gasped. \"What were you -?\"\\r\\n\"Just having a look around,\" Ron shrugged. \"Clues, you know -\"\\r\\n133\\r\\nPercy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry forcefully of Mrs.\\r\\nWeasley.\\r\\n\"Get - away - from - there -\" Perry said, striding toward them and\\r\\nstarting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. \"Don\\'t you care what\\r\\nthis looks like? Coming back here while everyone\\'s at dinner -\"\\r\\n\"Why shouldn\\'t we be here?\" said Ron hotly, stopping short and glaring\\r\\nat Percy. \"Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s what I told Ginny,\" said Percy fiercely, \"but she still seems to\\r\\nthink you\\'re going to be expelled, I\\'ve never seen her so upset, crying\\r\\nher eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly\\r\\noverexcited by this business -\"\\r\\n\"You don\\'t care about Ginny,\" said Ron, whose ears were now\\r\\n*157*\\r\\nreddening. \"You\\'re just worried I\\'m going to mess up your chances of\\r\\nbeing Head Boy -\"\\r\\n\"Five points from Gryffindor!\" Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect\\r\\nbadge. \"And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more detective work, or\\r\\nI\\'ll write to Mum!\"\\r\\nAnd he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron\\'s ears.\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy\\r\\nin the common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and\\r\\nkept blotting his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his\\r\\nwand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost\\r\\nas much as his homework, Ron slammed The Standard Book of Spells,\\r\\nGrade 2 shut. To Harry\\'s surprise, Hermione followed suit.\\r\\n\"Who can it be, though?\" she said in a quiet voice, as though\\r\\ncontinuing a conversation they had just been having. \"Who\\'d want to\\r\\nfrighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?\"\\r\\n\"Let\\'s think,\" said Ron in mock puzzlement. \"Who do we know who\\r\\nthinks Muggle-borns are scum?\"\\r\\n134\\r\\nHe looked at Hermione. Hermione looked back, unconvinced.\\r\\n\"If you\\'re talking about Malfoy -\"\\r\\n\"Of course I am!\" said Ron. \"You heard him - `You\\'ll be next,\\r\\nMudbloods!\\'- come on, you\\'ve only got to look at his foul rat face to\\r\\nknow it\\'s him -\"\\r\\n\"Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?\" said Hermione skeptically.\\r\\n\"Look at his family,\" said Harry, closing his books, too. \"The whole lot\\r\\nof them have been in Slytherin; he\\'s always boasting about it. They\\r\\ncould easily be Slytherin\\'s descendants. His father\\'s definitely evil\\r\\nenough.\"\\r\\n*158*\\r\\n\"They couldve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries!\"\\r\\nsaid Ron. \"Handing it down, father to son ......\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Hermione cautiously, \"I suppose it\\'s possible ......\\r\\n\"But how do we prove it?\" said Harry darkly.\\r\\n\"There might be a way,\" said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice still\\r\\nfurther with a quick glance across the room at Percy. \"Of course, it\\r\\nwould be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We\\'d be breaking\\r\\nabout fifty school rules, I expect -\"\\r\\n\"If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know,\\r\\nwon\\'t you?\" said Ron irritably.\\r\\n\"All right,\" said Hermione coldly. \"What we\\'d need to do is to get\\r\\ninside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions\\r\\nwithout him realizing it\\'s us.\"\\r\\n\"But that\\'s impossible,\" Harry said as Ron laughed.\\r\\n\"No, it\\'s not,\" said Hermione. \"All we\\'d need would be some Polyjuice\\r\\nPotion.\"\\r\\n\"What\\'s that?\" said Ron and Harry together.\\r\\n135\\r\\n\"Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago -\"\\r\\n\"D\\'you think we\\'ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to\\r\\nSnape?\" muttered Ron.\\r\\n\"It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could\\r\\nchange into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us.\\r\\nMalfoy would probably tell us anything. He\\'s probably boasting about it\\r\\nin the Slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him.\"\\r\\n\"This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,\" said Ron, frowning.\\r\\n\"What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?\"\\r\\n\"It wears off after a while,\" said Hermione, waving her hand\\r\\n*159*\\r\\nimpatiently. \"But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult.\\r\\nSnape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it\\'s\\r\\nbound to be in the Restricted Section of the library.\"\\r\\nThere was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted\\r\\nSection: You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher.\\r\\n\"Hard to see why we\\'d want the book, really,\" said Ron, \"if we\\r\\nweren\\'t going to try and make one of the potions.\"\\r\\n\"I think,\" said Hermione, \"that if we made it sound as though\\r\\nwe were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance ......\\r\\n\"Oh, come on, no teacher\\'s going to fall for that,\" said Ron.\\r\\n\"They\\'d have to be really thick . . . .\"\\r\\nC H-H A P T V It T 1\\' N\\r\\nTHE ROGUE BLUDGER\\r\\nince the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart had not\\r\\nbrought live creatures to class. Instead, he read passages from his\\r\\nbooks to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic\\r\\nbits. He usually picked Harry to help him with these reconstructions;\\r\\nso far, Harry had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager\\r\\nwhom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head\\r\\ncold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except\\r\\nlettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him.\\r\\n136\\r\\nHarry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next\\r\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf If\\r\\nhe hadn\\'t had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good\\r\\nmood, he would have refused to do it.\\r\\n\"Nice loud howl, Harry - exactly - and then, if you\\'ll believe it, I\\r\\npounced - like this - slammed him to the floor - thus with one hand, I\\r\\nmanaged to hold him down - with my other, I\\r\\n*161*\\r\\nput my wand to his throat -I then screwed up my remaining strength\\r\\nand performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm - he let\\r\\nout a piteous moan - go on, Harry - higher than that - good - the fur\\r\\nvanished - the fangs shrank - and he turned back into a man. Simple,\\r\\nyet effective - and another village will remember me forever as the\\r\\nhero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf\\r\\nattacks.\"\\r\\nThe bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet.\\r\\n\"Homework - compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga\\r\\nWagga Werewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the\\r\\nbest one!\"\\r\\nThe class began to leave. Harry returned to the back of the room,\\r\\nwhere Ron and Hermione were waiting.\\r\\n\"Ready?\" Harry muttered.\\r\\n\"Wait till everyone\\'s gone,\" said Hermione nervously. \"All right . . . \"\\r\\nShe approached Lockhart\\'s desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in\\r\\nher hand, Harry and Ron right behind her.\\r\\n\"Er - Professor Lockhart?\" Hermione stammered. \"I wanted to - to\\r\\nget this book out of the library. Just for background reading.\" She\\r\\nheld out the piece of paper, her hand shaking slightly. \"But the thing\\r\\nis, it\\'s in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to\\r\\n137\\r\\nsign for it - I\\'m sure it would help me understand what you say in\\r\\nGadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms\\r\\n\"Ah, Gadding with Ghouls!\" said Lockhart, taking the note from\\r\\nHermione and smiling widely at her. \"Possibly my very favorite\\r\\nbook. You enjoyed it?\"\\r\\n-162\\r\\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Hermione eagerly. \"So clever, the way you trapped that\\r\\nlast one with the tea-strainer -\"\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'m sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year\\r\\na little extra help,\" said Lockhart warmly, and he pulled out an\\r\\nenormous peacock quill. \"Yes, nice, isn\\'t it?\" he said, misreading the\\r\\nrevolted look on Ron\\'s face. \"I usually save it for book-signings.\"\\r\\nHe scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it\\r\\nback to Hermione.\\r\\n\"So, Harry,\" said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the note with\\r\\nfumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag. \"Tomorrow\\'s the first\\r\\nQuidditch match of the season, I believe? Gryffindor against Slytherin,\\r\\nis it not? I hear you\\'re a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. I was\\r\\nasked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life\\r\\nto the eradication of the Dark Forces. Still, if ever you feel the need\\r\\nfor a little private training, don\\'t hesitate to ask. Always happy to pass\\r\\non my expertise to less able players ......\\r\\nHarry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after\\r\\nRon and Hermione.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe it,\" he said as the three of them examined the signature\\r\\non the note. \"He didn\\'t even look at the book we wanted.\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s because he\\'s a brainless git,\" said Ron. \"But who cares, we\\'ve\\r\\ngot what we needed -\"\\r\\n\"He is not a brainless git,\" said Hermione shrilly as they half ran\\r\\ntoward the library.\\r\\n\"Just because he said you were the best student of the year -\"\\r\\n138\\r\\nThey dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the\\r\\nlibrary. Madam Pince, the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman who\\r\\nlooked like an underfed vulture.\\r\\n*163*\\r\\n\"Moste Potente Potions?\" she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the\\r\\nnote from Hermione; but Hermione wouldn\\'t let go.\\r\\n\"I was wondering if I could keep it,\" she said breathlessly.\\r\\n\"Oh, come on,\" said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it\\r\\nat Madam Pince. \"We\\'ll get you another autograph. Lockhart\\'ll sign\\r\\nanything if it stands still long enough.\"\\r\\nMadam Pince held the note up to the light, as though determined to\\r\\ndetect a forgery, but it passed the test. She stalked away between the\\r\\nlofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and\\r\\nmoldy-looking book. Hermione put it carefully into her bag and they\\r\\nleft, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty.\\r\\nFive minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle\\'s out-oforder\\r\\nbathroom once again. Hermione had overridden Ron\\'s objections\\r\\nby pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds\\r\\nwould go, so they were guaranteed some privacy. Moaning Myrtle\\r\\nwas crying noisily in her stall, but they were ignoring her, and she\\r\\nthem.\\r\\nHermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and the three of\\r\\nthem bent over the damp-spotted pages. It was clear from a glance\\r\\nwhy it belonged in the Restricted Section. Some of the potions had\\r\\neffects almost too gruesome to think about, and there were some very\\r\\nunpleasant illustrations, which included a man who seemed to have\\r\\nbeen turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of\\r\\narms out of her head.\\r\\n\"Here it is,\" said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed The\\r\\nPolyjuice Potion. It was decorated with drawings of people halfway\\r\\nthrough transforming into other people. Harry sin\\r\\n*164*\\r\\n139\\r\\ncerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their\\r\\nfaces.\\r\\n\"This is the most complicated potion I\\'ve ever seen,\" said Hermione as\\r\\nthey scanned the recipe. \"Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and\\r\\nknotgrass,\" she murmured, running her finger down the list of\\r\\ningredients. \"Well, they\\'re easy enough, they\\'re in the student storecupboard,\\r\\nwe can help ourselves .... Oooh, look, powdered horn of a\\r\\nbicorn - don\\'t know where we\\'re going to get that - shredded skin of a\\r\\nboomslang -. that\\'ll be tricky, too and of course a bit of whoever we\\r\\nwant to change into.\"\\r\\n\"Excuse me?\" said Ron sharply. \"What d\\'you mean, a bit of whoever\\r\\nwe\\'re changing into? I\\'m drinking nothing with Crabbe\\'s toenails in it -\"\\r\\nHermione continued as though she hadn\\'t heard him.\\r\\n\"We don\\'t have to worry about that yet, though, because we add those\\r\\nbits last ......\\r\\nRon turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another worry.\\r\\n\"D\\'you realize how much we\\'re going to have to steal, Hermione?\\r\\nShredded skin of a boomslang, that\\'s definitely not in the students\\'\\r\\ncupboard. What\\'re we going to do, break into Snape\\'s private stores? I\\r\\ndon\\'t know if this is a good idea ......\\r\\nHermione shut the book with a snap.\\r\\n\"Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,\" she said. There were\\r\\nbright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than\\r\\nusual. \"I don\\'t want to break rules, you know. I think threatening\\r\\nMuggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if\\r\\nyou don\\'t want to find out if it\\'s Malfoy, I\\'ll go straight to Madam Pince\\r\\nnow and hand the book back in =\\'\\r\\n*165\\r\\n\"I never thought Id see the day when you\\'d be persuading us to\\r\\nbreak rules,\" said Ron. \"All right, we\\'ll do it. But not toenails, okay?\"\\r\\n140\\r\\n\"How long will it take to make, anyway?\" said Harry as Hermione,\\r\\nlooking happier, opened the book again.\\r\\n\"Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and\\r\\nthe lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days ... I\\'d say\\r\\nit\\'d be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients.\"\\r\\n\"A month?\" said Ron. \"Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggleborns\\r\\nin the school by then!\" But Hermione\\'s eyes narrowed\\r\\ndangerously again, and he added swiftly, \"But it\\'s the best plan we\\'ve\\r\\ngot, so full steam ahead, I say.\"\\r\\nHowever, while Hermione was checking that the coast was clear for\\r\\nthem to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, \"It\\'ll be a lot less\\r\\nhassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow.\\r\\nHarry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking\\r\\nabout the coming Quidditch match. He was nervous, mainly at the\\r\\nthought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the\\r\\nidea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold\\r\\ncould buy. He had never wanted to beat Slytherin so badly. After\\r\\nhalf an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got up,\\r\\ndressed, and went down to breakfast early, where he found the rest\\r\\nof the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all looking\\r\\nuptight and not speaking much.\\r\\nAs eleven o\\'clock approached, the whole school started to make its\\r\\nway down to the Quidditch stadium. It was a muggy sort of day\\r\\n*166*\\r\\nwith a hint of thunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurrying\\r\\nover to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms. The\\r\\nteam pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to\\r\\nWood\\'s usual pre-match pep talk.\\r\\n\"Slytherin has better brooms than us,\" he began. \"No point denying it.\\r\\nBut we\\'ve got better people on our brooms. We\\'ve trained harder than\\r\\nthey have, we\\'ve been flying in all weathers -\" (\"Too true,\" muttered\\r\\nGeorge Weasley. \"I haven\\'t been properly dry since August\") \"- and\\r\\nwe\\'re going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime,\\r\\nMalfoy, buy his way onto their team.\"\\r\\n141\\r\\nChest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry.\\r\\n\"It\\'ll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a Seeker has to have\\r\\nsomething more than a rich father. Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or\\r\\ndie trying, Harry, because we\\'ve got to win today, we\\'ve got to.\"\\r\\n\"So no pressure, Harry\" said Fred, winking at him.\\r\\nAs they walked out onto the pitch, a roar of noise greeted them; mainly\\r\\ncheers, because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to see\\r\\nSlytherin beaten, but the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and\\r\\nhisses heard, too. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch teacher, asked Flint\\r\\nand Wood to shake hands, which they did, giving each other\\r\\nthreatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary.\\r\\n\"On my whistle,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Three ... two ... one. . .\\r\\nWith a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteen\\r\\nplayers rose toward the leaden sky. Harry flew higher than any of\\r\\nthem, squinting around for the Snitch.\\r\\n*167*\\r\\n\"All right there, Scarhead?\" yelled Malfoy, shooting underneath him as\\r\\nthough to show off the speed of his broom.\\r\\nHarry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a heavy black\\r\\nBludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that he\\r\\nfelt it ruffle his hair as it passed.\\r\\n\"Close one, Harry!\" said George, streaking past him with his club in his\\r\\nhand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin. Harry saw\\r\\nGeorge give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian\\r\\nPucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight\\r\\nfor Harry again.\\r\\nHarry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hard\\r\\ntoward Malfoy. Once again, the Bludger swerved like a boomerang\\r\\nand shot at Harry\\'s head.\\r\\nHarry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the\\r\\n142\\r\\npitch. He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him. What\\r\\nwas going on? Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it\\r\\nwas their job to try and unseat as many people as possible ....\\r\\nFred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end. Harry\\r\\nducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might; the Bludger\\r\\nwas knocked off course.\\r\\n\"Gotcha!\" Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it was\\r\\nmagnetically attracted to Harry, the Bludger pelted after him once\\r\\nmore and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed.\\r\\nIt had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face,\\r\\nsplattering onto his glasses. He didn\\'t have a clue what was going on\\r\\nin the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan, who was\\r\\ncommentating, say, \"Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero =\\'\\r\\n*168*\\r\\nThe Slytherins\\' superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and\\r\\nmeanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry\\r\\nout of the air. Fred and George were now flying so close to him on\\r\\neither side that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms\\r\\nand had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it.\\r\\n\"Someone\\'s - tampered - with - this - Bludger -\" Fred grunted,\\r\\nswinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\n\"We need time out,\" said George, trying to signal to Wood and stop\\r\\nthe Bludger breaking Harry\\'s nose at the same time.\\r\\nWood had obviously got the message. Madam Hooch\\'s whistle rang\\r\\nout and Harry, Fred, and George dived for the ground, still trying to\\r\\navoid the mad Bludger.\\r\\n\"What\\'s going on?\" said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled\\r\\ntogether, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered. \"We\\'re being\\r\\nflattened. Fred, George, where were you when that Bludger stopped\\r\\nAngelina scoring?\"\\r\\n\"We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other Bludger from\\r\\n143\\r\\nmurdering Harry, Oliver,\" said George angrily. \"Someone\\'s fixed it -\\r\\nit won\\'t leave Harry alone. It hasn\\'t gone for anyone else all game.\\r\\nThe Slytherins must have done something to it.\"\\r\\n\"But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch\\'s office since\\r\\nour last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then . . . . \"\\r\\nsaid Wood, anxiously.\\r\\nMadam Hooch was walking toward them. Over her shoulder, Harry\\r\\ncould see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction.\\r\\n169\\r\\n\"Listen,\" said Harry as she came nearer and nearer, \"with you two\\r\\nflying around me all the time the only way I\\'m going to catch the\\r\\nSnitch is if it flies up my sleeve. Go back to the rest of the team and\\r\\nlet me deal with the rogue one.\"\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be thick,\" said Fred. \"It\\'ll take your head off.\"\\r\\nWood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys.\\r\\n(I Oliver, this is insane,\" said Alicia Spinner angrily. \"You can\\'t let Harry\\r\\ndeal with that thing on his own. Let\\'s ask for an inquiry -))\\r\\n\"If we stop now, we\\'ll have to forfeit the match!\" said Harry. \"And\\r\\nwe\\'re not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger! Come\\r\\non, Oliver, tell them to leave me alone!\"\\r\\n\"This is all your fault,\" George said angrily to Wood. \" `Get the Snitch\\r\\nor die trying,\\' what a stupid thing to tell him -\"\\r\\nMadam Hooch had joined them.\\r\\n\"Ready to resume play?\" she asked Wood.\\r\\nWood looked at the determined look on Harry\\'s face.\\r\\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Fred, George, you heard Harry -leave him alone\\r\\nand let him deal with the Bludger on his own.\"\\r\\nThe rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam Hooch\\'s whistle,\\r\\n144\\r\\nHarry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the\\r\\nBludger behind him. Higher and higher Harry climbed; he looped and\\r\\nswooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless\\r\\nkept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his\\r\\nnostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the\\r\\nBludger. He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must\\r\\nlook very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn\\'t change\\r\\ndirection as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster\\r\\nride around the\\r\\n*170*\\r\\nedges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the\\r\\nGryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past\\r\\nWood\\r\\nA whistling in Harry\\'s ear told him the Bludger had just missed him\\r\\nagain; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.\\r\\n\"Training for the ballet, Potter?\" yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to\\r\\ndo a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the\\r\\nBludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at\\r\\nMalfoy in hatred, he saw it - the Golden Snitch. It was hovering inches\\r\\nabove Malfoy\\'s left ear - and Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn\\'t\\r\\nseen it.\\r\\nFor an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not daring to speed\\r\\ntoward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch.\\r\\nWHAM.\\r\\nHe had stayed still a second too long. The Bludger had hit him at last,\\r\\nsmashed into his elbow, and Harry felt his arm break. Dimly, dazed by\\r\\nthe searing pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain-drenched\\r\\nbroom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless at\\r\\nhis side - the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this time\\r\\nW-ming at his face - Harry swerved out of the way, one idea firmly\\r\\nlodged in his numb brain: get to Malfoy.\\r\\nThrough a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, sneering\\r\\nface below him and saw its eyes widen with fear: Malfoy thought\\r\\nHarry was attacking him.\\r\\n145\\r\\n\"What the -\" he gasped, careening out of Harry\\'s way.\\r\\nHarry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch;\\r\\nhe felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only\\r\\n*171*\\r\\ngripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd\\r\\nbelow as he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass\\r\\nout.\\r\\nWith a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom. His\\r\\narm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, he heard,\\r\\nas though from a distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. He\\r\\nfocused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand.\\r\\n\"Aha,\" he said vaguely. \"We\\'ve won.\"\\r\\nAnd he fainted.\\r\\nHe came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with\\r\\nsomeone leaning over him. He saw a glitter of teeth.\\r\\n\"Oh, no, not you,\" he moaned.\\r\\n\"Doesn\\'t know what he\\'s saying,\" said Lockhart loudly to the anxious\\r\\ncrowd of Gryffindors pressing around them. \"Not to worry, Harry.\\r\\nI\\'m about to fix your arm.\"\\r\\n\"No!\"said Harry. \"I\\'ll keep it like this, thanks ......\\r\\nHe tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard a familiar\\r\\nclicking noise nearby.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want a photo of this, Colin,\" he said loudly.\\r\\n\"Lie back, Harry,\" said Lockhart soothingly. \"It\\'s a simple charm I\\'ve\\r\\nused countless times -\"\\r\\n\"Why can\\'t I just go to the hospital wing?\" said Harry through\\r\\nclenched teeth.\\r\\n146\\r\\n\"He should really, Professor,\" said a muddy Wood, who couldn\\'t\\r\\nhelp grinning even though his Seeker was injured. \"Great capture,\\r\\nHarry, really spectacular, your best yet, Id say -\"\\r\\nThrough the thicket of legs around him, Harry spotted Fred and\\r\\n*112*\\r\\nGeorge Weasley, wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box. It was still\\r\\nputting up a terrific fight.\\r\\n\"Stand back,\" said Lockhart, who was rolling up his jade-green\\r\\nsleeves.\\r\\n\"No - don\\'t -\" said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was twirling his wand\\r\\nand a second later had directed it straight at Harry\\'s arm.\\r\\nA strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry\\'s shoulder and\\r\\nspread all the way down to his fingertips. It felt as though his arm was\\r\\nbeing deflated. He didn\\'t dare look at what was happening. He had\\r\\nshut his eyes, his face turned away from his arm, but his worst fears\\r\\nwere realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creevey\\r\\nbegan clicking away madly. His arm didn\\'t hurt anymore - nor did it\\r\\nfeel remotely like an arm.\\r\\n\"Ah,\" said Lockhart. \"Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. But the\\r\\npoint is, the bones are no longer broken. That\\'s the thing to bear in\\r\\nmind. So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah, Mr. Weasley,\\r\\nMiss Granger, would you escort him? - and Madam Pomfrey will be\\r\\nable to - er - tidy you up a bit.\"\\r\\nAs Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deep\\r\\nbreath he looked down at his right side. What he saw nearly made him\\r\\npass out again.\\r\\nPoking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, fleshcolored\\r\\nrubber glove. He tried to move his fingers. Nothing happened.\\r\\nLockhart hadn\\'t mended Harry\\'s bones. He had removed them.\\r\\nMadam Pomfrey wasn\\'t at all pleased.\\r\\n147\\r\\n\"You should have come straight to me!\" she raged, holding up\\r\\n*173*\\r\\nthe sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a\\r\\nworking arm. \"I can mend bones in a second - but growing them back -\\r\\n\"\\r\\n\"You will be able to, won\\'t you?\" said Harry desperately.\\r\\n\"I\\'ll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,\" said Madam Pomfrey\\r\\ngrimly, throwing Harry a pair of pajamas. \"You\\'ll have to stay the\\r\\nnight ......\\r\\nHermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry\\'s bed while\\r\\nRon helped him into his pajamas. It took a while to stuff the rubbery,\\r\\nboneless arm into a sleeve.\\r\\n\"How can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione, eh?\" Ron called\\r\\nthrough the curtain as he pulled Harry\\'s limp fingers through the cuff.\\r\\n\"If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked.\"\\r\\n\"Anyone can make a mistake,\" said Hermione. \"And it doesn\\'t hurt\\r\\nanymore, does it, Harry?\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry, getting into bed. \"But it doesn\\'t do anything else\\r\\neither.\"\\r\\nAs he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly.\\r\\nHermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain. Madam\\r\\nPomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro.\\r\\n\"You\\'re in for a rough night,\" she said, pouring out a steaming\\r\\nbeakerful and handing it to him. \"Regrowing bones is a nasty business.\\r\\nSo was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry\\'s mouth and throat as it\\r\\nwent down, making him cough and splutter. Still tut-tutting about\\r\\ndangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey re\\r\\n*114*\\r\\n148\\r\\ntreated, leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some\\r\\nwater.\\r\\n\"We won, though,\" said Ron, a grin breaking across his face.\\r\\n\"That was some catch you made. Malfoy\\'s face ... he looked ready\\r\\nto kill ......\\r\\n\"I want to know how he fixed that Bludger,\" said Hermione\\r\\ndarkly.\\r\\n\"We can add that to the list of questions we\\'ll ask him when\\r\\nwe\\'ve taken the Polyjuice Potion,\" said Harry, sinking back onto\\r\\nhis pillows. \"I hope it tastes better than this stuff .....\\r\\n\"If it\\'s got bits of Slytherins in it? You\\'ve got to be joking,\" said\\r\\nRon.\\r\\nThe door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment. Filthy\\r\\nand soaking wet, the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\n\"Unbelievable flying, Harry,\" said George. \"I\\'ve just seen Mar\\r\\ncus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Something about having the Snitch on\\r\\ntop of his head and not noticing. Malfoy didn\\'t seem too happy.\"\\r\\nThey had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice;\\r\\nthey gathered around Harry\\'s bed and were just getting started on\\r\\nwhat promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came\\r\\nstorming over, shouting, \"This boy needs rest, he\\'s got thirty-three\\r\\nbones to regrow! Out! OUT!\"\\r\\nAnd Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him from the\\r\\nstabbing pains in his limp arm.\\r\\nHours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch\\r\\nblackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His arm now felt full of\\r\\nlarge splinters. For a second, he thought that was what had woken\\r\\nhim. Then, with a thrill of horror, he realized that someone was\\r\\nsponging his forehead in the dark.\\r\\n\"Get off!\" he said loudly, and then, \"Dobby!\"\\r\\nThe house-elf\\'s goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry\\r\\nthrough the darkness. A single tear was running down his long,\\r\\npointed nose.\\r\\n\"Harry Potter came back to school,\" he whispered miserably.\\r\\n149\\r\\n\"Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter. Ah sir, why didn\\'t you\\r\\nheed Dobby? Why didn\\'t Harry Potter go back home when he\\r\\nmissed the train?\"\\r\\nHarry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby\\'s sponge\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\"What\\'re you doing here?\" he said. \"And how did you know I missed\\r\\nthe train?\"\\r\\nDobby\\'s lip trembled and Harry was seized by a sudden suspicion.\\r\\n\"It was you!\" he said slowly. \"You stopped the barrier from letting us\\r\\nthrough!\"\\r\\n\"Indeed yes, sir,\" said Dobby, nodding his head vigorously, ears\\r\\nflapping. \"Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the\\r\\ngateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward\" - he showed\\r\\nHarry ten long, bandaged fingers - \"but Dobby didn\\'t care, sir, for he\\r\\nthought Harry Potter was safe, and never did Dobby dream that Harry\\r\\nPotter would get to school another way!\"\\r\\nHe was rocking backward and forward, shaking his ugly head.\\r\\n\"Dobby was \\'so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at\\r\\nHogwarts, he let his master\\'s dinner burn! Such a flogging Dobby\\r\\nnever had, sir . .....\\r\\n*176*\\r\\nHarry slumped back onto his pillows.\\r\\n\"You nearly got Ron and me expelled,\" he said fiercely. \"You\\'d better\\r\\nget lost before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you.\"\\r\\nDobby smiled weakly.\\r\\n\"Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day\\r\\nat home.\"\\r\\nHe blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore, looking\\r\\nso pathetic that Harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself.\\r\\n150\\r\\n\"Why d\\'you wear that thing, Dobby?\" he asked curiously.\\r\\n\"This, sir?\" said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase. \"\\'Tis a mark of the\\r\\nhouse-elf\\'s enslavement, sir. Dobby can only be freed if his masters\\r\\npresent him with clothes, sir. The family is careful not to pass Dobby\\r\\neven a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house\\r\\nforever.\"\\r\\nDobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly, \"Harry Potter must\\r\\ngo home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make -\"\\r\\n\"Your Bludger?\" said Harry, anger rising once more. \"What d\\'you\\r\\nmean, your Bludger? You made that Bludger try and kill me?\"\\r\\n\"Not kill you, sir, never kill you!\" said Dobby, shocked. \"Dobby wants\\r\\nto save Harry Potter\\'s life! Better sent home, grievously injured, than\\r\\nremain here sir! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to be\\r\\nsent home!\"\\r\\n\"Oh, is that all?\" said Harry angrily. \"I don\\'t suppose you\\'re going to\\r\\ntell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces?\"\\r\\n\"Ah, if Harry Potter only knew!\" Dobby groaned, more tears dripping\\r\\nonto his ragged pillowcase. \"If he knew what he means\\r\\n*177*\\r\\nto us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we dregs of the magical world!\\r\\nDobby remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\\r\\nwas at the height of his powers, sir! We house-elfs were treated like\\r\\nvermin, sir! Of course, Dobby is still treated like that, sir,\" he admitted,\\r\\ndrying his face on the pillowcase. \"But mostly, sir, life has improved\\r\\nfor my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.\\r\\nHarry Potter survived, and the Dark Lord\\'s power was broken, and it\\r\\nwas a new dawn, sir, and Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope\\r\\nfor those of us who thought the Dark days would never end, sit... And\\r\\nnow, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to happen, are perhaps happening\\r\\nalready, and Dobby cannot let Harry Potter stay here now that history\\r\\nis to repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once more\\r\\nDobby froze, horrorstruck, then grabbed Harry\\'s water jug from his\\r\\n151\\r\\nbedside table and cracked it over his own head, toppling out of sight. A\\r\\nsecond later, he crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering,\\r\\n\"Bad Dobby, very bad Dobby. . .\"\\r\\n\"So there is a Chamber of Secrets?\" Harry whispered. \"And did you\\r\\nsay it\\'s been opened before? Tell me, Dobby!\"\\r\\nHe seized the elf\\'s bony wrist as Dobby\\'s hand inched toward the\\r\\nwater jug. \"But I\\'m not Muggle-born - how can I be in danger from the\\r\\nChamber?\"\\r\\n\"Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby,\" stammered the elf,\\r\\nhis eyes huge in the dark. \"Dark deeds are planned in this place, but\\r\\nHarry Potter must not be here when they happen - go home, Harry\\r\\nPotter, go home. Harry Potter must not meddle in this, sir, \\'tis too\\r\\ndangerous -\"\\r\\n\"Who is it, Dobby?\" Harry said, keeping a firm hold on Dobby\\'s\\r\\n*178*\\r\\nwrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again. \"Who\\'s\\r\\nopened it? Who opened it last time?\"\\r\\n\"Dobby can\\'t, sir, Dobby can\\'t, Dobby mustn\\'t tell!\" squealed the elf.\\r\\n\"Go home, Harry Potter, go home!\"\\r\\n\"I\\'m not going anywhere!\" said Harry fiercely. \"One of my best\\r\\nfriends is Muggle-born; she\\'ll be first in line if the Chamber really has\\r\\nbeen opened -\"\\r\\n\"Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends!\" moaned Dobby in a\\r\\nkind of miserable ecstasy. \"So noble! So valiant! But he must save\\r\\nhimself, he must, Harry Potter must not -\"\\r\\nDobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Harry heard it, too.\\r\\nThere were footsteps coming down the passageway outside.\\r\\n\"Dobby must go!\" breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud crack,\\r\\nand Harry\\'s fist was suddenly clenched on thin air. He slumped back\\r\\ninto bed, his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the\\r\\nfootsteps drew nearer.\\r\\n152\\r\\nNext moment, Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing a\\r\\nlong woolly dressing gown and a nightcap. He was carrying one end\\r\\nof what looked like a statue. Professor McGonagall appeared a\\r\\nsecond later, carrying its feet. Together, they heaved it onto a bed.\\r\\n\"Get Madam Pomfrey,\" whispered Dumbledore, and Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall hurried past the end of Harry\\'s bed out of sight. Harry lay\\r\\nquite still, pretending to be asleep. He heard urgent voices, and then\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall swept back into view, closely followed by\\r\\nMadam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress.\\r\\nHe heard a sharp intake of breath.\\r\\n\"What happened?\" Madam Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore,\\r\\nbending over the statue on the bed.\\r\\n*l79*\\r\\n\"Another attack,\" said Dumbledore. \"Minerva found him on the stairs.\\r\\n\"There was a bunch of grapes next to him,\" said Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall. \"We think he was trying to sneak up here to visit Potter.\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and carefully, he raised\\r\\nhimself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed. A ray\\r\\nof moonlight lay across its staring face.\\r\\nIt was Colin Creevey. His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck\\r\\nup in front of him, holding his camera.\\r\\n\"Petrified?\" whispered Madam Pomfrey.\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"But I shudder to think ... If Albus\\r\\nhadn\\'t been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate - who knows\\r\\nwhat might have -\"\\r\\nThe three of them stared down at Colin. Then Dumbledore leaned\\r\\nforward and wrenched the camera out of Colin\\'s rigid grip.\\r\\n\"You don\\'t think he managed to get a picture of his attacker?\" said\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall eagerly.\\r\\n153\\r\\nDumbledore didn\\'t answer. He opened the back of the camera.\\r\\n\"Good gracious!\" said Madam Pomfrey.\\r\\nA jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. Harry, three beds away,\\r\\ncaught the acrid smell of burnt plastic.\\r\\n\"Melted,\" said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly. \"All melted...\"\\r\\n\"What does this mean, Albus?\" Professor McGonagall asked\\r\\nurgently.\\r\\n\"It means,\" said Dumbledore, \"that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed\\r\\nopen again.\"\\r\\nMadam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth. Professor McGonagall\\r\\nstared at Dumbledore.\\r\\n*180*\\r\\n\"But, Albus ... surely ... who?\"\\r\\n\"The question is not who,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes on Colin.\\r\\n\"The question is, how . . . .\"\\r\\nAnd from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall\\'s shad\\r\\nowy face, she didn\\'t understand this any better than he did.\\r\\nC H-H A P T t R ELEVEN\\r\\nTHE D-KJEL]ING C-L-IJIB\\r\\nHarry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with\\r\\nwinter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff. He sat up quickly\\r\\nand looked over at Colin\\'s bed, but it had been blocked from view by\\r\\nthe high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday. Seeing that he\\r\\nwas awake, Madam Pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray\\r\\nand then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers.\\r\\n\"All in order,\" she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge lefthanded.\\r\\n\"When you\\'ve finished eating, you may leave.\"\\r\\nHarry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor\\r\\nTower, desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby,\\r\\n154\\r\\nbut they weren\\'t there. Harry left to look for them, wondering where\\r\\nthey could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren\\'t\\r\\ninterested in whether he had his bones back or not.\\r\\n*182*\\r\\nAs Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled out of it,\\r\\nlooking in far better spirits than last time they\\'d met.\\r\\n\"Oh, hello, Harry,\" he said. \"Excellent flying yesterday, really\\r\\nexcellent. Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup you\\r\\nearned fifty points!\"\\r\\n\"You haven\\'t seen Ron or Hermione, have you?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"No, I haven\\'t,\" said Percy, his smile fading. \"I hope Ron\\'s not in\\r\\nanother girls\\' toilet .....\\r\\nHarry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then\\r\\nheaded straight for Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. He couldn\\'t see why\\r\\nRon and Hermione would be in there again, but after making sure\\r\\nthat neither Filch nor any prefects were around, he opened the door\\r\\nand heard their voices coming from a locked stall.\\r\\n\"It\\'s me,\" he said, closing the door behind him. There was a clunk, a\\r\\nsplash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione\\'s eye\\r\\npeering through the keyhole.\\r\\n`Harry!\" she said. \"You gave us such a fright - come in how\\'s your\\r\\narm?\"\\r\\n\"Fine,\" said Harry, squeezing into the stall. An old cauldron was\\r\\nperched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told Harry\\r\\nthey had lit a fire beneath it. Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires\\r\\nwas a speciality of Hermione\\'s.\\r\\n\"We\\'d\\'ve come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the\\r\\nPolyjuice Potion,\" Ron explained as Harry, with difficulty, locked the\\r\\nstall again. \"We\\'ve decided this is the safest place to hide it.\"\\r\\n155\\r\\nHarry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione interrupted.\\r\\n\"We already know - we heard Professor McGonagall telling\\r\\nProfessor Flitwick this morning. That\\'s why we decided we\\'d better get\\r\\ngoing -\"\\r\\n\"The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better,\" snarled\\r\\nRon. \"D\\'you know what I think? He was in such a foul temper after\\r\\nthe Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin.\"\\r\\n\"There\\'s something else,\" said Harry, watching Hermione tearing\\r\\nbundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion. \"Dobby came\\r\\nto visit me in the middle of the night.\"\\r\\nRon and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told them everything\\r\\nDobby had told him - or hadn\\'t told him. Hermione and Ron listened\\r\\nwith their mouths open.\\r\\n\"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?\" Hermione said.\\r\\n\"This settles it,\" said Ron in a triumphant voice. \"Lucius Malfoy must\\'ve\\r\\nopened the Chamber when he was at school here and now he\\'s told\\r\\ndear old Draco how to do it. It\\'s obvious. Wish Dobby\\'d told you what\\r\\nkind of monster\\'s in there, though. I want to know how come nobody\\'s\\r\\nnoticed it sneaking around the school.\"\\r\\n\"Maybe it can make itself invisible,\" said Hermione, prodding leeches to\\r\\nthe bottom of the cauldron. \"Or maybe it can disguise itself - pretend to\\r\\nbe a suit of armor or something - I\\'ve read about Chameleon Ghouls -\"\\r\\n\"You read too much, Hermione,\" said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on\\r\\ntop of the leeches. He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked\\r\\nat Harry.\\r\\n\"So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your\\r\\narm He shook his head. \"You know what, Harry? If he doesn\\'t\\r\\nstop trying to save your life he\\'s going to kill you.\"\\r\\n*184*\\r\\n156\\r\\nThe news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying\\r\\nas though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire\\r\\nschool by Monday morning. The air was suddenly thick with rumor\\r\\nand suspicion. The first years were now moving around the castle in\\r\\ntight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they\\r\\nventured forth alone.\\r\\nGinny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was\\r\\ndistraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the\\r\\nwrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns covering\\r\\nthemselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind\\r\\nstatues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told\\r\\nthem he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was\\r\\nhaving nightmares.\\r\\nMeanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans,\\r\\namulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school.\\r\\nNeville Longbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a\\r\\npointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other\\r\\nGryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger; he was a pureblood,\\r\\nand therefore unlikely to be attacked.\\r\\n\"They went for Filch first,\" Neville said, his round face fearful. \"And\\r\\neveryone knows I\\'m almost a Squib.\"\\r\\nIn the second week of December Professor McGonagall came\\r\\naround as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at\\r\\nschool for Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; they\\r\\nhad heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very\\r\\nsuspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use the\\r\\nPolyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him.\\r\\nUnfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still\\r\\n* 3-85*\\r\\nneeded the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place\\r\\nthey were going to get them was from Snape\\'s private stores. Harry\\r\\nprivately felt he\\'d rather face Slytherin\\'s legendary monster than let\\r\\nSnape catch him robbing his office.\\r\\n157\\r\\n\"What we need,\" said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon\\'s\\r\\ndouble Potions lesson loomed nearer, \"is a diversion. Then one of us\\r\\ncan sneak into Snape\\'s office and take what we need.\"\\r\\nHarry and Ron looked at her nervously.\\r\\n\"I think Id better do the actual stealing,\" Hermione continued in a\\r\\nmatter-of-fact tone. \"You two will be expelled if you get into any more\\r\\ntrouble, and I\\'ve got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause\\r\\nenough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.\\r\\nHarry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape\\'s Potions\\r\\nclass was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.\\r\\nPotions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday\\r\\nafternoon\\'s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons\\r\\nstood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass\\r\\nscales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes,\\r\\nmaking waspish remarks about the Gryffindors\\' work while the\\r\\nSlytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape\\'s\\r\\nfavorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who\\r\\nknew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you\\r\\ncould say \"Unfair.\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on\\r\\nmore important things. He was waiting for Hermione\\'s signal, and he\\r\\nhardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery\\r\\n*186*\\r\\npotion. When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, Hermione\\r\\ncaught Harry\\'s eye and nodded.\\r\\nHarry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred\\'s\\r\\nFilibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his\\r\\nwand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had only\\r\\nseconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it\\r\\nlanded right on target in Goyle\\'s cauldron.\\r\\nGoyle\\'s potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked\\r\\nas splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and\\r\\nhis nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his\\r\\n158\\r\\nhands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate -\\r\\nSnape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened.\\r\\nThrough the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape\\'s\\r\\noffice.\\r\\n\"Silence! SILENCE!\" Snape roared. \"Anyone who has been splashed,\\r\\ncome here for a Deflating Draft - when I find out who did this -\"\\r\\nHarry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head\\r\\ndrooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the\\r\\nclass lumbered up to Snape\\'s desk, some weighted down with arms\\r\\nlike clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips, Harry\\r\\nsaw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes\\r\\nbulging.\\r\\nWhen everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings\\r\\nhad subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle\\'s cauldron and scooped out\\r\\nthe twisted black remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush.\\r\\n*187*\\r\\n\"If I ever find out who threw this,\" Snape whispered, \"I shall make\\r\\nsure that person is expelled.\"\\r\\nHarry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled\\r\\nexpression. Snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten\\r\\nminutes later could not have been more welcome.\\r\\n\"He knew it was me,\" Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried\\r\\nback to Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. \"I could tell.\"\\r\\nHermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to\\r\\nstir feverishly.\\r\\n\"It\\'ll be ready in two weeks,\" she said happily.\\r\\n\"Snape can\\'t prove it was you,\" said Ron reassuringly to Harry.\\r\\n\"What can he do?\"\\r\\n\"Knowing Snape, something foul,\" said Harry as the potion frothed\\r\\nand bubbled.\\r\\n159\\r\\nA week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking across the\\r\\nentrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around\\r\\nthe notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been\\r\\npinned up. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them\\r\\nover, looking excited.\\r\\n\"They\\'re starting a Dueling Club!\" said Seamus. \"First meeting\\r\\ntonight! I wouldn\\'t mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy\\r\\none of these days ......\\r\\n\"What, you reckon Slytherin\\'s monster can duel?\" said Ron, but he,\\r\\ntoo, read the sign with interest.\\r\\n\"Could be useful,\" he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into\\r\\ndinner. \"Shall we go?\"\\r\\nHarry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o\\'clock that\\r\\n*188*\\r\\nevening they hurried back to the Great Hall. The long dining tables\\r\\nhad vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by\\r\\nthousands of candles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety\\r\\nblack once more and most of the school seemed to be packed\\r\\nbeneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited.\\r\\n\"I wonder who\\'ll be teaching us?\" said Hermione as they edged into\\r\\nthe chattering crowd. \"Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling\\r\\nchampion when he was young - maybe it\\'ll be him.\"\\r\\n\"As long as it\\'s not -\" Harry began, but he ended on a groan:\\r\\nGilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes\\r\\nof deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape, wearing\\r\\nhis usual black.\\r\\nLockhart waved an arm for silence and called \\' \"Gather round,\\r\\ngather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me?\\r\\nExcellent!\\r\\n\"Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start\\r\\nthis little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend\\r\\nyourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions - for full\\r\\n160\\r\\ndetails, see my published works.\\r\\n\"Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape,\" said Lockhart,\\r\\nflashing a wide smile. \"He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about\\r\\ndueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short\\r\\ndemonstration before we begin. Now, I don\\'t want any of you\\r\\nyoungsters to worry - you\\'ll still have your Potions master when I\\'m\\r\\nthrough with him, never fear!\"\\r\\n\"Wouldn\\'t it be good if they finished each other off?\" Ron muttered in\\r\\nHarry\\'s ear.\\r\\nSnape\\'s upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why Lockhart\\r\\n*189*\\r\\nwas still smiling; if Snape had been looking at him like that he\\'d have\\r\\nbeen running as fast as he could in the opposite direction.\\r\\nLockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at least,\\r\\nLockhart did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas Snape jerked\\r\\nhis head irritably. Then they raised their wands like swords in front of\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\"As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative\\r\\nposition,\" Lockhart told the silent crowd. \"On the count of three, we\\r\\nwill cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.\"\\r\\n\"I wouldn\\'t bet on that,\" Harry murmured, watching Snape baring his\\r\\nteeth.\\r\\n\"One - two - three -\"\\r\\nBoth of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them\\r\\nat their opponent; Snape cried: \"Expelliarmus!\" There was a dazzling\\r\\nflash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew\\r\\nbackward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to\\r\\nsprawl on the floor.\\r\\nMalfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered. Hermione was\\r\\ndancing on tiptoes. \"Do you think he\\'s all right?\" she squealed through\\r\\nher fingers.\\r\\n161\\r\\n\"Who cares?\" said Harry and Ron together.\\r\\nLockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat had fallen off and\\r\\nhis wavy hair was standing on end.\\r\\n\"Well, there you have it!\" he said, tottering back onto the platform.\\r\\n\"That was a Disarming Charm - as you see, I\\'ve lost my wand - ah,\\r\\nthank you, Miss Brown - yes, an excellent idea to show them that,\\r\\nProfessor Snape, but if you don\\'t mind my saying\\r\\n*190*\\r\\nso, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to\\r\\nstop you it would have been only too easy - however, I felt it would be\\r\\ninstructive to let them see . . .\"\\r\\nSnape was looking murderous. Possibly Lockhart had noticed, because\\r\\nhe said, \"Enough demonstrating! I\\'m going to come amongst you now\\r\\nand put you all into pairs. Professor Snape, if you\\'d like to help me -\"\\r\\nThey moved through the crowd, matching up partners. Lockhart\\r\\nteamed Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Snape reached Harry\\r\\nand Ron first.\\r\\n\"Time to split up the dream team, I think,\" he sneered. \"Weasley, you\\r\\ncan partner Finnigan. Potter -\"\\r\\nHarry moved automatically toward Hermione.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think so,\" said Snape, smiling coldly. \"Mr. Malfoy, come over\\r\\nhere. Let\\'s see what you make of the famous Potter. And you, Miss\\r\\nGranger - you can partner Miss Bulstrode.\"\\r\\nMalfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a Slytherin girl who\\r\\nreminded Harry of a picture he\\'d seen in Holidays with Hags. She was\\r\\nlarge and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione\\r\\ngave her a weak smile that she did not return.\\r\\n\"Face your partners!\" called Lockhart, back on the platform. \"And\\r\\nbow!\"\\r\\n162\\r\\nHarry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off\\r\\neach other.\\r\\n\"Wands at the ready!\" shouted Lockhart. \"When I count to three, cast\\r\\nyour charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm them - we don\\'t\\r\\nwant any accidents - one ... two ... three -\"\\r\\n*191*\\r\\nHarry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on \"two\":\\r\\nHis spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he\\'d been hit over the\\r\\nhead with a saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be\\r\\nworking, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at\\r\\nMalfoy and shouted, \"Rictusempra!\"\\r\\nA jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up,\\r\\nwheezing.\\r\\n\"I said disarm only!\" Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the\\r\\nbattling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his knees; Harry had hit him with a\\r\\nTickling Charm, and he could barely move for laughing. Harry hung\\r\\nback, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy\\r\\nwhile he was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath,\\r\\nMalfoy pointed his wand at Harry\\'s knees, choked, \"Tarantallegra!\"\\r\\nand the next second Harry\\'s legs began to jerk around out of his\\r\\ncontrol in a kind of quickstep.\\r\\n\"Stop! Stop!\" screamed Lockhart, but Snape took charge.\\r\\n\"Finite Incantatem!\" he shouted; Harry\\'s feet stopped dancing, Malfoy\\r\\nstopped laughing, and they were able to look up.\\r\\nA haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene. Both Neville\\r\\nand Justin were lying on the floor, panting; Ron was holding up an\\r\\nashen-faced Seamus, apologizing for whatever his broken wand had\\r\\ndone; but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving;\\r\\nMillicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whimpering\\r\\nin pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor. Harry leapt\\r\\nforward and pulled Millicent off. It was difficult: She was a lot bigger\\r\\nthan he was.\\r\\n\"Dear, dear,\" said Lockhart, skittering through the crowd, looking at\\r\\n163\\r\\nthe aftermath of the duels. \"Up you go, Macmillan ....\\r\\n*192*\\r\\nCareful there, Miss Fawcett .... Pinch it hard, it\\'ll stop bleeding in a\\r\\nsecond, Boot\\r\\n\"I think Id better teach you how to block unfriendly spells,\" said\\r\\nLockhart, standing flustered in the midst of the hall. He glanced at\\r\\nSnape, whose black eyes glinted, and looked quickly away. \"Let\\'s\\r\\nhave a volunteer pair - Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley, how about\\r\\nyou -\"\\r\\n\"A bad idea, Professor Lockhart,\" said Snape, gliding over like a large\\r\\nand malevolent bat. \"Longbottom causes devastation with the simplest\\r\\nspells. We\\'ll be sending what\\'s left of Finch-Fletchley up to the\\r\\nhospital wing in a matchbox.\" Neville\\'s round, pink face went pinker.\\r\\n\"How about Malfoy and Potter?\" said Snape with a twisted smile.\\r\\n\"Excellent idea!\" said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and Malfoy into the\\r\\nmiddle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room.\\r\\n\"Now, Harry,\" said Lockhart. \"When Draco points his wand at you,\\r\\nyou do this.\"\\r\\nHe raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wiggling\\r\\naction, and dropped it. Snape smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up,\\r\\nsaying, \"Whoops -my wand is a little overexcited -\"\\r\\nSnape moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and whispered something\\r\\nin his ear. Malfoy smirked, too. Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart\\r\\nand said, \"Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again?\"\\r\\n\"Scared?\" muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn\\'t hear him.\\r\\n\"You wish,\" said Harry out of the corner of his mouth.\\r\\nLockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder. \"Just do what I did,\\r\\nHarry!\"\\r\\n\"What, drop my wand?\"\\r\\n164\\r\\nBut Lockhart wasn\\'t listening.\\r\\n\"Three - two - one - go!\" he shouted.\\r\\nMalfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed, \"Serpensortia!\"\\r\\nThe end of his wand exploded. Harry watched, aghast, as a long black\\r\\nsnake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, and\\r\\nraised itself, ready to strike. There were screams as the crowd\\r\\nbacked swiftly away, clearing the floor.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t move, Potter,\" said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of\\r\\nHarry standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. \"I\\'ll get\\r\\nrid of it ......\\r\\n\"Allow me!\" shouted Lockhart. He brandished his wand at the snake\\r\\nand there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten\\r\\nfeet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged,\\r\\nhissing furiously, it slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and\\r\\nraised itself again, fangs exposed, poised to strike.\\r\\nHarry wasn\\'t sure what made him do it. He wasn\\'t even aware of\\r\\ndeciding to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him\\r\\nforward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly\\r\\nat the snake, \"Leave him alone!\" And miraculously - inexplicably - the\\r\\nsnake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, its\\r\\neyes now on Harry. Harry felt the fear drain out of him. He knew the\\r\\nsnake wouldn\\'t attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn\\'t\\r\\nhave explained.\\r\\nHe looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see Justin looking\\r\\n*194*\\r\\nrelieved, or puzzled, or even grateful - but certainly not angry and\\r\\nscared.\\r\\n\"What do you think you\\'re playing at?\" he shouted, and before Harry\\r\\ncould say anything, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall.\\r\\nSnape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in a\\r\\nsmall puff of black smoke. Snape, too, was looking at Harry in an\\r\\n165\\r\\nunexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Harry\\r\\ndidn\\'t like it. He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all\\r\\naround the walls. Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes.\\r\\n\"Come on,\" said Rods voice in his ear. \"Move - come on -\"\\r\\nRon steered him out of the hall, Hermione hurrying alongside them. As\\r\\nthey went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as\\r\\nthough they were frightened of catching something. Harry didn\\'t have\\r\\na clue what was going on, and neither Ron nor Hermione explained\\r\\nanything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty\\r\\nGryffindor common room. Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair\\r\\nand said, \"You\\'re a Parselmouth. Why didn\\'t you tell us?\"\\r\\n\"I\\'m a what?\" said Harry.\\r\\n`A Parselmouth!\" said Ron. \"You can talk to snakes!\"\\r\\n\"I know,\" said Harry. \"I mean, that\\'s only the second time I\\'ve ever\\r\\ndone it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the\\r\\nzoo once - long story - but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil\\r\\nand I sort of set it free without meaning to that was before I knew I\\r\\nwas a wizard -\"\\r\\n\"A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?\" Ron repeated\\r\\nfaintly.\\r\\n*195*\\r\\n\"So?\" said Harry. \"I bet loads of people here can do it.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, no they can\\'t,\" said Ron. \"It\\'s not a very common gift. Harry, this\\r\\nis bad.\"\\r\\n\"What\\'s bad?\" said Harry, starting to feel quite angry. \"What\\'s wrong\\r\\nwith everyone? Listen, if I hadn\\'t told that snake not to attack Justin -\"\\r\\n\"Oh, that\\'s what you said to it?\"\\r\\n\"What d\\'you mean? You were there - you heard me -\"\\r\\n\"I heard you speaking Parseltongue,\" said Ron. \"Snake language. You\\r\\n166\\r\\ncould have been saying anything - no wonder Justin panicked, you\\r\\nsounded like you were egging the snake on or something - it was\\r\\ncreepy, you know -\"\\r\\nHarry gaped at him.\\r\\n\"I spoke a different language? But - I didn\\'t realize - how can I speak\\r\\na language without knowing I can speak it?\"\\r\\nRon shook his head. Both he and Hermione were looking as though\\r\\nsomeone had died. Harry couldn\\'t see what was so terrible.\\r\\n\"D\\'you want to tell me what\\'s wrong with stopping a massive snake\\r\\nbiting off Justin\\'s head?\" he said. \"What does it matter how I did it as\\r\\nlong as Justin doesn\\'t have to join the Headless Hunt?\"\\r\\n\"It matters,\" said Hermione, speaking at last in a hushed voice,\\r\\n\"because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was\\r\\nfamous for. That\\'s why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s mouth fell open.\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" said Ron. \"And now the whole school\\'s going to think you\\'re\\r\\nhis great-great-great-great-grandson or something -\"\\r\\n\"But I\\'m not,\" said Harry, with a panic he couldn\\'t quite explain.\\r\\n\"You\\'ll find that hard to prove,\" said Hermione. \"He lived about a\\r\\nthousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.\"\\r\\n* IL96 *\\r\\nHarry lay awake for hours that night. Through a gap in the curtains\\r\\naround his four-poster he watched snow starting to drift past the\\r\\ntower window and wondered . . .\\r\\nCould he be a descendant of Salazar Slithering? He didn\\'t know\\r\\nanything about his father\\'s family, after all. The Dursleys had always\\r\\nforbidden questions about his wizarding relatives.\\r\\nQuietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue. The words\\r\\nwouldn\\'t come. It seemed he had to be face-to-face with a snake to\\r\\n167\\r\\ndo it.\\r\\nBut I\\'m in Gryffindor, Harry thought. The Sorting Hat wouldn\\'t\\r\\nhave put me in here if I had Slytherin blood...\\r\\nAh, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the Sorting Hat wanted to\\r\\nput you in Slytherin, don\\'t you remember?\\r\\nHarry turned over. He\\'d see Justin the next day in Herbology and he\\'d\\r\\nexplain that he\\'d been calling the snake off, not egging it on, which (he\\r\\nthought angrily, pummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized.\\r\\nBy next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had\\r\\nturned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the\\r\\nterm was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves\\r\\non the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else,\\r\\nnow that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and\\r\\nrevive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey.\\r\\nHarry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common\\r\\nroom, while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of\\r\\nwizard chess.\\r\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, Harry,\" said Hermione, exasperated, as one\\r\\n*197*\\r\\nof Ron\\'s bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off\\r\\nthe board. \"Go and find Justin if it\\'s so important to you.\"\\r\\nSo Harry got up and left through the portrait hole, wondering where\\r\\nJustin might be.\\r\\nThe castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the\\r\\nthick, swirling gray snow at every window. Shivering, Harry walked\\r\\npast classrooms where lessons were taking place, catching snatches of\\r\\nwhat was happening within. Professor McGonagall was shouting at\\r\\nsomeone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend into a badger.\\r\\nResisting the urge to take a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that\\r\\nJustin might be using his free time to catch up on some work, and\\r\\ndeciding to check the library first.\\r\\n168\\r\\nA group of the Hufliepuffs who should have been in Herbology were\\r\\nindeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn\\'t seem to be\\r\\nworking. Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see\\r\\nthat their heads were close together and they were having what looked\\r\\nlike an absorbing conversation. He couldn\\'t see whether Justin was\\r\\namong them. He was walking toward them when something of what\\r\\nthey were saying met his ears, and he paused to listen, hidden in the\\r\\nInvisibility section.\\r\\n\"So anyway,\" a stout boy was saying, \"I told Justin to hide up in our\\r\\ndormitory. I mean to say, if Potter\\'s marked him down as his next\\r\\nvictim, it\\'s best if he keeps a low profile for a while. Of course, Justin\\'s\\r\\nbeen waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to\\r\\nPotter he was Muggle-born. Justin actually told him he\\'d been down\\r\\nfor Eton. That\\'s not the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin\\'s\\r\\nheir on the loose, is it?\"\\r\\n\"You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?\" said a girl with blonde\\r\\npigtails anxiously.\\r\\n198\\r\\n\"Hannah,\" said the stout boy solemnly, \"he\\'s a Parselmouth. Everyone\\r\\nknows that\\'s the mark of a Dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a\\r\\ndecent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself\\r\\nSerpent-tongue.\"\\r\\nThere was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie went on,\\r\\n\"Remember what was written on the wall? Enemies of the Heir,\\r\\nBeware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we\\r\\nknow, Flich\\'s cat\\'s attacked. That first year, Creevey, was annoying\\r\\nPotter at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him while he was\\r\\nlying in the mud. Next thing we know - Creevey\\'s been attacked.\"\\r\\n\"He always seems so nice, though,\" said Hannah uncertainly, \"and,\\r\\nwell, he\\'s the one who made You-Know-Who disappear. He can\\'t be\\r\\nall bad, can he?\"\\r\\nErnie lowered his voice mysteriously, the Hufflepuffs bent closer, and\\r\\nHarry edged nearer so that he could catch Ernie\\'s words.\\r\\n\"No one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who. I\\r\\n169\\r\\nmean to say, he was only a baby when it happened. He should have\\r\\nbeen blasted into smithereens. Only a really powerful Dark wizard\\r\\ncould have survived a curse like that.\" He dropped his voice until it\\r\\nwas barely more than a whisper, and said, \"That\\'s probably why You-\\r\\nKnow-Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn\\'t want another\\r\\nDark Lord competing with him. I wonder what other powers Potter\\'s\\r\\nbeen hiding?\"\\r\\nHarry couldn\\'t take anymore. Clearing his throat loudly, he stepped out\\r\\nfrom behind the bookshelves. If he hadn\\'t been feeling so angry, he\\r\\nwould have found the sight that greeted him funny: Every one of the\\r\\nHufflepuffs looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of\\r\\nhim, and the color was draining out of Ernie\\'s face.\\r\\n*199*\\r\\n\"Hello,\" said Harry. \"I\\'m looking for Justin Finch-Fletchley.\"\\r\\nThe Hufepuffs\\' worst fears had clearly been confirmed. They all\\r\\nlooked fearfully at Ernie.\\r\\n\"What do you want with him?\" said Ernie in a quavering voice.\\r\\n\"I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the\\r\\nDueling Club,\" said Harry.\\r\\nErnie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, \"We\\r\\nwere all there. We saw what happened.\"\\r\\n\"Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed off?\"\\r\\nsaid Harry.\\r\\n\"All I saw,\" said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as he\\r\\nspoke, \"was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake\\r\\ntoward Justin. \"\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t chase it at him!\" Harry said, his voice shaking with anger. \"It\\r\\ndidn\\'t even touch him!\"\\r\\n\"It was a very near miss,\" said Ernie. \"And in case you\\'re getting\\r\\nideas,\" he added hastily, \"I might tell you that you can trace my\\r\\nfamily back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and\\r\\n170\\r\\nmy blood\\'s as pure as anyone\\'s, so -\"\\r\\n- cc I don\\'t care what sort of blood you\\'ve got!\" said Harry fiercely.\\r\\n\"Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?\"\\r\\n\"I\\'ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with,\" said Ernie swiftly.\\r\\n\"It\\'s not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them,\" said\\r\\nHarry. \"Id like to see you try it.\"\\r\\nHe turned on his heel and stormed out of the library, earning himself\\r\\na reproving glare from Madam Pince, who was polishing the gilded\\r\\ncover of a large spellbook.\\r\\n*200*\\r\\nHarry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where he was going,\\r\\nhe was in such a fury. The result was that he walked into something\\r\\nvery large and solid, which knocked him backward onto the floor.\\r\\n\"Oh, hello, Hagrid,\" Harry said, looking up.\\r\\nHagrid\\'s face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow-covered\\r\\nbalaclava, but it couldn\\'t possibly be anyone else, as he filled most of\\r\\nthe corridor in his moleskin overcoat. A dead rooster was hanging\\r\\nfrom one of his massive, gloved hands.\\r\\n\"All righ\\', Harry?\" he said, pulling up the balaclava so he could\\r\\nspeak. \"Why aren\\'t yeh in class?\"\\r\\n\"Canceled,\" said Harry, getting up. \"What\\'re you doing in here?\"\\r\\nHagrid held up the limp rooster.\\r\\n\"Second one killed this term,\" he explained. \"It\\'s either foxes or a\\r\\nBlood-Suckin Bugbear, an\\' I need the Headmaster\\'s permission ter\\r\\nput a charm around the hen coop.\"\\r\\nHe peered more closely at Harry from under his thick, snowflecked\\r\\neyebrows.\\r\\n\"Yeh sure yeh\\'re all righ\\'? Yeh look all hot an\\' bothered -\"\\r\\n171\\r\\nHarry couldn\\'t bring himself to repeat what Ernie and the rest of the\\r\\nHufflepuffs had been saying about him.\\r\\n\"It\\'s nothing,\" he said. \"Id better get going, Hagrid, it\\'s Transfiguration\\r\\nnext and I\\'ve got to pick up my books.\"\\r\\nHe walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him.\\r\\n\"Justin\\'s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he\\r\\nlet slip to Potter he was Muggle-born .....\\r\\n* 2 0 IL *\\r\\nHarry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor,\\r\\nwhich was particularly dark; the torches had been extinguished by a\\r\\nstrong, icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane. He\\r\\nwas halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over\\r\\nsomething lying on the floor.\\r\\nHe turned to squint at what he\\'d fallen over and felt as though his\\r\\nstomach had dissolved.\\r\\nJustin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of\\r\\nshock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. And\\r\\nthat wasn\\'t all. Next to him was another figure, the strangest sight\\r\\nHarry had ever seen.\\r\\nIt was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and\\r\\ntransparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal,\\r\\nsix inches off the floor. His head was half off and his face wore an\\r\\nexpression of shock identical to Justin\\'s.\\r\\nHarry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing a\\r\\nkind of drumroll against his ribs. He looked wildly up and down the\\r\\ndeserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they\\r\\ncould away from the bodies. The only sounds were the muffled\\r\\nvoices of teachers from the classes on either side.\\r\\nHe could run, and no one would ever know he had been there. But\\r\\nhe couldn\\'t just leave them lying here .... He had to get help ....\\r\\nWould anyone believe he hadn\\'t had anything to do with this?\\r\\n172\\r\\nAs he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him opened with a\\r\\nbang. Peeves the Poltergeist came shooting out.\\r\\n\"Why, it\\'s potty wee Potter!\" cackled Peeves, knocking Harry\\'s\\r\\nglasses askew as he bounced past him. \"What\\'s Potter up to? Why\\'s\\r\\nPotter lurking -\"\\r\\n*202*\\r\\nPeeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. Upside down,\\r\\nhe spotted Justin and Nearly Headless Nick. He flipped the right\\r\\nway up, filled his lungs and, before Harry could stop him, screamed,\\r\\n\"ATTACK! ATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTAL\\r\\nOR GHOST IS SAFE! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!\\r\\nATTAAAACK!\"\\r\\nCrash - crash - crash - door after door flew open along the corridor\\r\\nand people flooded out. For several long minutes, there was a scene\\r\\nof such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and\\r\\npeople kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry found himself\\r\\npinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall came running, followed by her own class, one of whom\\r\\nstill had black-and-white-striped hair. She used her wand to set off\\r\\naloud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into\\r\\ntheir classes. No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie\\r\\nthe Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene.\\r\\n\"Caught in the act!\" Ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing his\\r\\nfinger dramatically at Harry.\\r\\n\"That will do, Macmillan!\" said Professor McGonagall sharply.\\r\\nPeeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the\\r\\nscene; Peeves always loved chaos. As the teachers bent over Justin\\r\\nand Nearly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song:\\r\\n\"Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done,\\r\\nYou\\'re killing off\\' students, you think it\\'s good fun -\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s enough Peeves!\" barked Professor McGonagall, and Peeves\\r\\nzoomed away backward, with his tongue out at Harry.\\r\\n173\\r\\n*203*\\r\\nJustin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and\\r\\nProfessor Sinistra of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed\\r\\nto know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the end, Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave to\\r\\nErnie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs.\\r\\nThis Ernie did, fanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. This\\r\\nleft Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together.\\r\\n\"This way, Potter,\" she said.\\r\\n\"Professor,\" said Harry at once, \"I swear I didn\\'t -\"\\r\\n\"This is out of my hands, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall curtly.\\r\\nThey marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a\\r\\nlarge and extremely ugly stone gargoyle.\\r\\n\"Lemon drop!\" she said. This was evidently a password, because the\\r\\ngargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind\\r\\nhim split in two. Even full of dread for what was coming, Harry\\r\\ncouldn\\'t fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that\\r\\nwas moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. As he and Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed behind\\r\\nthem. They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last,\\r\\nslightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass\\r\\nknocker in the shape of a griffin.\\r\\nHe knew now where he was being taken. This must be where\\r\\nDumbledore lived.\\r\\n*204*\\r\\nC I3 A P T V RR T W E I V\\r\\nTHE POLYJUICE POTION\\r\\nhey stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall rapped on the door. It opened silently and they entered.\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there, alone.\\r\\n174\\r\\nHarry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers\\'\\r\\noffices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore\\'s was by far\\r\\nthe most interesting. If he hadn\\'t been scared out of his wits that he\\r\\nwas about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very\\r\\npleased to have a chance to look around it.\\r\\nIt was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A\\r\\nnumber of curious silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tables,\\r\\nwhirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered\\r\\nwith portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom\\r\\nwere snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous,\\r\\nclaw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered\\r\\nwizard\\'s hat - the Sorting Hat.\\r\\n*205*\\r\\nHarry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and\\r\\nwizards on the walls. Surely it couldn\\'t hurt if he took the hat down\\r\\nand tried it on again? Just to see ... just to make sure it had put him in\\r\\nthe right House\\r\\nHe walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and\\r\\nlowered it slowly onto his head. It was much too large and slipped\\r\\ndown over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he\\'d put it on.\\r\\nHarry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a small voice\\r\\nsaid in his ear, \"Bee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?\"\\r\\n\"Er, yes,\" Harry muttered. \"Er - sorry to bother you - I wanted to ask -\\r\\n\"\\r\\n\"You\\'ve been wondering whether I put you in the right House,\" said\\r\\nthe hat smartly. \"Yes ... you were particularly difficult to place. But I\\r\\nstand by what I said before\" - Harry\\'s heart leapt - \"you would have\\r\\ndone well in Slytherin -\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of the hat and\\r\\npulled it off. It hung limply in his hand, grubby and faded. Harry\\r\\npushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick.\\r\\n175\\r\\n\"You\\'re wrong,\" he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn\\'t move.\\r\\nHarry backed away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging noise behind\\r\\nhim made him wheel around.\\r\\nHe wasn\\'t alone after all. Standing on a golden perch behind the door\\r\\nwas a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey.\\r\\nHarry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making its\\r\\ngagging noise again. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dull\\r\\nand, even as Harry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail.\\r\\nHarry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore\\'s\\r\\npet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the bird\\r\\nburst into flames.\\r\\nHarry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. He looked\\r\\nfeverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but\\r\\ncouldn\\'t see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave\\r\\none loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smouldering\\r\\npile of ash on the floor.\\r\\nThe office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking very somber.\\r\\n\"Professor,\" Harry gasped. \"Your bird - I couldn\\'t do anything - he just\\r\\ncaught fire -\"\\r\\nTo Harry\\'s astonishment, Dumbledore smiled.\\r\\n\"About time, too,\" he said. \"He\\'s been looking dreadful for days; I\\'ve\\r\\nbeen telling him to get a move on.\"\\r\\nHe chuckled at the stunned look on Harry\\'s face.\\r\\n\"Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is\\r\\ntime for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Watch him . . .\"\\r\\nHarry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke\\r\\nits head out of the ashes. It was quite as ugly as the old one.\\r\\n\"It\\'s a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,\" said Dumbledore,\\r\\nseating himself behind his desk. \"He\\'s really very handsome most of\\r\\nthe time, wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating creatures,\\r\\n176\\r\\nphoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have\\r\\nhealing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.\"\\r\\nIn the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what he\\r\\nwas there for, but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settled\\r\\nhimself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his\\r\\npenetrating, light-blue stare.\\r\\nBefore Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of\\r\\nthe office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild\\r\\nlook in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head\\r\\nand the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.\\r\\n\"It wasn\\' Harry, Professor Dumbledore!\" said Hagrid urgently. \"I was\\r\\ntalkin\\' ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir -\\r\\n\"\\r\\nDumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on,\\r\\nwaving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers\\r\\neverywhere.\\r\\n\"- it can\\'t\\'ve bin him, I\\'ll swear it in front o\\' the Ministry o\\' Magic if I\\r\\nhave to -\"\\r\\n\"Hagrid, I -\"\\r\\n\"- yeh\\'ve got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never =\\'\\r\\n\"Hagrid!\" said Dumbledore loudly. \"I do not think that Harry\\r\\nattacked those people.\"\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side. \"Right. I\\'ll wait\\r\\noutside then, Headmaster.\"\\r\\nAnd he stomped out looking embarrassed.\\r\\n\"You don\\'t think it was me, Professor?\" Harry repeated hopefully as\\r\\nDumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk.\\r\\n\"No, Harry, I don\\'t,\" said Dumbledore, though his face was somber\\r\\nagain. \"But I still want to talk to you.\"\\r\\n177\\r\\nHarry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of\\r\\nhis long fingers together.\\r\\n*208*\\r\\n\"I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you\\'d like to tell me,\"\\r\\nhe said gently. \"Anything at all.\"\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, \"You\\'ll\\r\\nbe next, Mudbloods!\" and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in\\r\\nMoaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied\\r\\nvoice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said:\\r\\n\"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn\\'t a good sign, even in the\\r\\nwizarding world.\" He thought, too, about what everyone was saying\\r\\nabout him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected\\r\\nwith Salazar Slytherin ....\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"There isn\\'t anything, Professor . . . .\"\\r\\nThe double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what\\r\\nhad hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly\\r\\nHeadless Nick\\'s fate that seemed to worry people most. What could\\r\\npossibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; what terrible\\r\\npower could harm someone who was already dead? There was\\r\\nalmost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that\\r\\nstudents could go home for Christmas.\\r\\n\"At this rate, we\\'ll be the only ones left,\" Ron told Harry and\\r\\nHermione. \"Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it\\'s\\r\\ngoing to be.\"\\r\\nCrabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed\\r\\nup to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most people\\r\\nwere leaving. He was tired of people skirting around him in the\\r\\ncorridors, as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired\\r\\nof all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.\\r\\n*209*\\r\\nFred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out of\\r\\ntheir way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting,\\r\\n178\\r\\n\"Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming\\r\\nthrough ......\\r\\nPercy was deeply disapproving of this behavior.\\r\\n\"It is not a laughing matter,\" he said coldly.\\r\\n\"Oh, get out of the way, Percy,\" said Fred. \"Harry\\'s in a hurry.\"\\r\\n\"Yeah, he\\'s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his\\r\\nfanged servant,\" said George, chortling.\\r\\nGinny didn\\'t find it amusing either.\\r\\n\"Oh, don\\'t,\" she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he\\r\\nwas planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry\\r\\noff with a large clove of garlic when they met.\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at\\r\\nleast, thought the idea of his being Slytherin\\'s heir was quite ludicrous.\\r\\nBut their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked\\r\\nincreasingly sour each time he saw them at it.\\r\\n\"It\\'s because he\\'s bursting to say it\\'s really him,\" said Ron knowingly.\\r\\n\"You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you\\'re\\r\\ngetting all the credit for his dirty work.\"\\r\\n\"Not for long,\" said Hermione in a satisfied tone. \"The Polyjuice\\r\\nPotion\\'s nearly ready. We\\'ll be getting the truth out of him any day\\r\\nnow.\"\\r\\nAt last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds\\r\\ndescended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy,\\r\\nand enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run\\r\\nof Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could\\r\\n*210*\\r\\nplay Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice\\r\\ndueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at\\r\\nschool rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.\\r\\nPercy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior,\\r\\n179\\r\\ndidn\\'t spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. He had\\r\\nalready told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas\\r\\nbecause it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during\\r\\nthis troubled time.\\r\\nChristmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, the only\\r\\nones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione,\\r\\nwho burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.\\r\\n\"Wake up,\" she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window.\\r\\n\"Hermione - you\\'re not supposed to be in here -\" said Ron, shielding\\r\\nhis eyes against the light.\\r\\n\"Merry Christmas to you, too,\" said Hermione, throwing him his\\r\\npresent. \"I\\'ve been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to\\r\\nthe potion. It\\'s ready.\"\\r\\nHarry sat up, suddenly wide awake.\\r\\n\"Are you sure?\"\\r\\n\"Positive,\" said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could\\r\\nsit down on the end of Ron\\'s four-poster. \"If we\\'re going to do it, I\\r\\nsay it should be tonight.\"\\r\\nAt that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a very\\r\\nsmall package in her beak.\\r\\n\"Hello,\" said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. \"Are you\\r\\nspeaking to me again?\"\\r\\n211\\r\\nShe nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far\\r\\nbetter present than the one that she had brought him, which turned\\r\\nout to be from the Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a\\r\\nnote telling him to find out whether he\\'d be able to stay at Hogwarts\\r\\nfor the summer vacation, too.\\r\\nThe rest of Harry\\'s Christmas presents were far more satisfactory.\\r\\nHagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge, which Harry decided\\r\\n180\\r\\nto soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called\\r\\nFlying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite\\r\\nQuidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxury eagle-feather\\r\\nquill. Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted\\r\\nsweater from Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card\\r\\nwith a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley\\'s car (which\\r\\nhadn\\'t been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the\\r\\nbout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next.\\r\\nNo one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later,\\r\\ncould fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts.\\r\\nThe Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen\\r\\nfrost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and\\r\\nmistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling,\\r\\nwarm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of his\\r\\nfavorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every\\r\\ngoblet of eggnog he consumed. Percy, who hadn\\'t noticed that Fred\\r\\nhad bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read \"Pinhead,\" kept\\r\\nasking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry didn\\'t even care\\r\\nthat Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remarks\\r\\n* 2:L2 *\\r\\nabout his new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck,\\r\\nMalfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours\\' time.\\r\\nHarry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas\\r\\npudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their\\r\\nplans for the evening.\\r\\n\"We still need a bit of the people you\\'re changing into,\" said\\r\\nHermione matter-of-facdy, as though she were sending them to the\\r\\nsupermarket for laundry detergent. \"And obviously, it\\'ll be best if you\\r\\ncan get something of Crabbe\\'s and Goyle\\'s; they\\'re Malfoys best\\r\\nfriends, he\\'ll tell them anything. And we also need to make sure the\\r\\nreal Crabbe and Goyle can\\'t burst in on us while we\\'re interrogating\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got it all worked out,\" she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry\\'s\\r\\nand Ron\\'s stupefied faces. She held up two plump chocolate cakes.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is\\r\\n181\\r\\nmake sure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how greedy they\\r\\nare, they\\'re bound to eat them. Once they\\'re asleep, pull out a few of\\r\\ntheir hairs and hide them in a broom closet.\"\\r\\nHarry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.\\r\\n\"Hermione, I don\\'t think -\"\\r\\n\"That could go seriously wrong -\"\\r\\nBut Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall sometimes had.\\r\\n\"The potion will be useless without Crabbe\\'s and Goyle\\'s hair,\" she\\r\\nsaid sternly. \"You do want to investigate Malfoy, don\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\"Oh, all right, all right,\" said Harry. \"But what about you? Whose hair\\r\\nare you ripping out?\"\\r\\n*213*\\r\\n\"I\\'ve already got mine!\" said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle\\r\\nout of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it.\\r\\n\"Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling\\r\\nClub? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me!\\r\\nAnd she\\'s gone home for Christmas - so I\\'ll just have to tell the\\r\\nSlytherins I\\'ve decided to come back.\"\\r\\nWhen Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion\\r\\nagain, Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression.\\r\\n\"Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go\\r\\nwrong?\"\\r\\nBut to Harry\\'s and Ron\\'s utter amazement, stage one of the\\r\\noperation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said. They lurked\\r\\nin the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe\\r\\nand Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling\\r\\ndown fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched the chocolate\\r\\ncakes on the end of the banisters. When they spotted Crabbe and\\r\\nGoyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly\\r\\nbehind a suit of armor next to the front door.\\r\\n182\\r\\n\"How thick can you get?\" Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe\\r\\ngleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. Grinning\\r\\nstupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. For a\\r\\nmoment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their\\r\\nfaces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both\\r\\nkeeled over backward onto the floor.\\r\\nBy far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall.\\r\\nOnce they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry\\r\\nyanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle\\'s fore\\r\\n* _2 14 *\\r\\nhead and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe\\'s hairs. They also stole\\r\\ntheir shoes, because their own were far too small for Crabbe- and\\r\\nGoyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they\\r\\nsprinted up to Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom.\\r\\nThey could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall\\r\\nin which Hermione was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes up\\r\\nover their faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door.\\r\\n\"Hermione?\"\\r\\nThey heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shinyfaced\\r\\nand looking anxious. Behind her they heard the gloop gloop\\r\\nof the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on\\r\\nthe toilet seat.\\r\\n\"Did you get them?\" Hermione asked breathlessly.\\r\\nHarry showed her Goyle\\'s hair.\\r\\n\"Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,\" Hermione\\r\\nsaid, holding up a small sack. \"You\\'ll need bigger sizes once you\\'re\\r\\nCrabbe and Goyle.\"\\r\\nThe three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked\\r\\nlike thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly.\\r\\n\"I\\'m sure I\\'ve done everything right,\" said Hermione, nervously\\r\\n183\\r\\nrereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. \"It looks like the\\r\\nbook says it should ... once we\\'ve drunk it, we\\'ll have exactly an hour\\r\\nbefore we change back into ourselves.\"\\r\\n\"Now what?\" Ron whispered.\\r\\n\"We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.\"\\r\\nHermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses.\\r\\nThen, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode\\'s hair out of\\r\\nits bottle into the first glass.\\r\\n*215*\\r\\nThe potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A\\r\\nsecond later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.\\r\\n\"Urgh - essence of Millicent Bulstrode,\" said Ron, eyeing it with\\r\\nloathing. \"Bet it tastes disgusting.\"\\r\\n\"Add yours, then,\" said Hermione.\\r\\nHarry dropped Goyle\\'s hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe\\'s\\r\\ninto the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle\\'s turned the\\r\\nkhaki color of a booger, Crabbe\\'s a dark, murky brown.\\r\\n\"Hang on,\" said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses.\\r\\n\"We\\'d better not all drink them in here .... Once we turn into Crabbe\\r\\nand Goyle we won\\'t fit. And Millicent Bulstrode\\'s no pixie.\\r\\n\"Good thinking,\" said Ron, unlocking the door. \"We\\'ll take separate\\r\\nstalls.\"\\r\\nCareful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into\\r\\nthe middle stall.\\r\\n\"Ready?\" he called.\\r\\n\"Ready,\" came Ron\\'s and Hermione\\'s voices.\\r\\n\"One - two - three -\"\\r\\n184\\r\\nPinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps. It\\r\\ntasted like overcooked cabbage.\\r\\nImmediately, his insides started writhing as though he\\'d just swallowed\\r\\nlive snakes - doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be\\r\\nsick - then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the\\r\\nvery ends of his fingers and toes - next, bringing him gasping to all\\r\\nfours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his body\\r\\nbubbled like hot wax - and before his eyes, his hands began to grow,\\r\\nthe fingers thickened, the nails broadened,\\r\\n* 2116 *\\r\\nthe knuckles were bulging like bolts -his shoulders stretched painfully\\r\\nand a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down\\r\\ntoward his eyebrows - his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a\\r\\nbarrel bursting its hoops - his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too\\r\\nsmall\\r\\nAs suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Harry lay facedown\\r\\non the stone-cold floor, listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end\\r\\ntoilet. With difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So this was\\r\\nwhat it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand trembling, he pulled off\\r\\nhis old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on\\r\\nthe spare ones, and laced up Goyle\\'s boatlike shoes. He reached up to\\r\\nbrush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry\\r\\nbristles, low on his forehead. Then he realized that his glasses were\\r\\nclouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn\\'t need them - he took\\r\\nthem off and called, \"Are you two okay?\" Goyle\\'s low rasp of a voice\\r\\nissued from his mouth.\\r\\n\"Yeah,\" came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right.\\r\\nHarry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror.\\r\\nGoyle stared back at him out of dull, deepset eyes. Harry scratched\\r\\nhis ear. So did Goyle.\\r\\nRon\\'s door opened. They stared at each other. Except that he looked\\r\\npale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the\\r\\npudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms.\\r\\n\"This is unbelievable,\" said Ron, approaching the mirror and prodding\\r\\n185\\r\\nCrabbe\\'s flat nose. \"Unbelievable. \"\\r\\n\"We\\'d better get going,\" said Harry, loosening the watch that was\\r\\ncutting into Goyle\\'s thick wrist. \"We\\'ve still got to find out\\r\\n* 217*\\r\\nwhere the Slytherin common room is. I only hope we can find\\r\\nsomeone to follow. . .\"\\r\\nRon, who had been gazing at Harry, said, \"You don\\'t know how\\r\\nbizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.\" He banged on Hermione\\'s door.\\r\\n\"C\\'mon, we need to go -\"\\r\\nA high-pitched voice answered him.\\r\\n\"I - I don\\'t think I\\'m going to come after all. You go on without me.\\r\\n\"Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode\\'s ugly, no one\\'s going to\\r\\nknow it\\'s you -\"\\r\\n\"No - really - I don\\'t think I\\'ll come. You two hurry up, you re\\r\\nwasting time\\r\\nHarry looked at Ron, bewildered.\\r\\n\"That looks more like Goyle,\" said Ron. \"That\\'s how he looks every\\r\\ntime a teacher asks him a question.\"\\r\\n\"Hermione, are you okay?\" said Harry through the door.\\r\\n\"Fine - I\\'m fine - go on -\"\\r\\nHarry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty minutes had\\r\\nalready passed.\\r\\n\"We\\'ll meet you back here, all right?\" he said.\\r\\nHarry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked\\r\\nthat the coast was clear, and set off.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t swing your arms like that,\" Harry muttered to Ron.\\r\\n186\\r\\n\"Eh?\"\\r\\n\"Crabbe holds them sort of stiff . . . .\"\\r\\n\"How\\'s this?\"\\r\\n\"Yeah, that\\'s better . . . .\"\\r\\nThey went down the marble staircase. All they needed now was\\r\\n*218*\\r\\na Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but\\r\\nthere was nobody around.\\r\\n\"Any ideas?\" muttered Harry.\\r\\n\"The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,\" said\\r\\nRon, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons. The words had barely\\r\\nleft his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the\\r\\nentrance.\\r\\n\"Excuse me,\" said Ron, hurrying up to her. \"We\\'ve forgotten the way\\r\\nto our common room.\"\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said the girl stiffly. \"Our common room? I\\'m a\\r\\nRavenclaw.\"\\r\\nShe walked away, looking suspiciously back at them.\\r\\nHarry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their\\r\\nfootsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe\\'s and Goyle\\'s huge\\r\\nfeet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn\\'t going to be as easy as they\\r\\nhad hoped.\\r\\nThe labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked deeper and\\r\\ndeeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to see\\r\\nhow much time they had left. After a quarter of an hour, just when\\r\\nthey were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead.\\r\\n\"Ha!\" said Ron excitedly. \"There\\'s one of them now!\"\\r\\n187\\r\\nThe figure was emerging from a side room. As they hurried nearer,\\r\\nhowever, their hearts sank. It wasn\\'t a Slytherin, it was Percy.\\r\\n\"What\\'re you doing down here?\" said Ron in surprise.\\r\\nPercy looked affronted.\\r\\n\"That,\" he said stiffly, \"is none of your business. It\\'s Crabbe, isn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n2 19\\r\\n\"Wh - oh, yeah,\" said Ron.\\r\\n\"Well, get off to your dormitories,\" said Percy sternly. \"It\\'s not safe to\\r\\ngo wandering around dark corridors these days.\"\\r\\n\"You are,\" Ron pointed out.\\r\\n\"I,\" said Percy, drawing himself up, \"am a prefect. Nothing\\'s about to\\r\\nattack me.\"\\r\\nA voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron. Draco Malfoy was\\r\\nstrolling toward them, and for the first time in his life, Harry was\\r\\npleased to see him.\\r\\n\"There you are,\" he drawled, looking at them. \"Have you two been\\r\\npigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I\\'ve been looking for you; I\\r\\nwant to show you something really funny.\"\\r\\nMalfoy glanced witheringly at Percy.\\r\\n\"And what\\'re you doing down here, Weasley?\" he sneered.\\r\\nPercy looked outraged.\\r\\n\"You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect!\" he said. \"I\\r\\ndon\\'t like your attitude!\"\\r\\nMalfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him. Harry\\r\\nalmost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in\\r\\ntime. He and Ron hurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into\\r\\n188\\r\\nthe next passage, \"That Peter Weasley -\"\\r\\n\"Percy,\" Ron corrected him automatically.\\r\\n\"Whatever,\" said Malfoy. \"I\\'ve noticed him sneaking around a lot\\r\\nlately. And I bet I know what he\\'s up to. He thinks he\\'s going to catch\\r\\nSlytherin\\'s heir single-handed.\"\\r\\nHe gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron exchanged excited\\r\\nlooks.\\r\\nMalfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall.\\r\\n* 220 *\\r\\n\"What\\'s the new password again?\" he said to Harry.\\r\\n\"Er -\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Oh, yeah -pure-blood!\" said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone door\\r\\nconcealed in the wall slid open. Malfoy marched through it, and\\r\\nHarry and Ron followed him.\\r\\nThe Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room\\r\\nwith rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps\\r\\nwere hanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately\\r\\ncarved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several Slytherins were\\r\\nsilhouetted around it in high-backed chairs.\\r\\n\"Wait here,\" said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning them to a pair\\r\\nof empty chairs set back from the fire. \"I\\'ll go and get it my father\\'s\\r\\njust sent it to me -\"\\r\\nWondering what Malfoy was going to show them, Harry and Ron\\r\\nsat down, doing their best to look at home.\\r\\nMalfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked like a\\r\\nnewspaper clipping. He thrust it under Ron\\'s nose.\\r\\n\"That\\'ll give you a laugh,\" he said.\\r\\nHarry saw Ron\\'s eyes widen in shock. He read the clipping quickly,\\r\\n189\\r\\ngave a very forced laugh, and handed it to Harry.\\r\\nIt had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and it said:\\r\\nINQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC\\r\\nArthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office,\\r\\nwas today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car.\\r\\nMr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft\\r\\nand Wizardry, where the\\r\\n221\\r\\nenchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for Mr.\\r\\nWeasley\\'s resignation.\\r\\n\"Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,\" Mr. Malfoy told our\\r\\nreporter. \"He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous\\r\\nMuggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately.\"\\r\\nMr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife told\\r\\nreporters to clear off or she\\'d set the family ghoul on them.\\r\\n\"Well?\" said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the clipping back to\\r\\nhim. \"Don\\'t you think it\\'s funny?\"\\r\\n\"Ha, ha,\" said Harry bleakly.\\r\\n\"Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in\\r\\nhalf and go and join them,\" said Malfoy scornfully. \"You\\'d never know\\r\\nthe Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave.\"\\r\\nRon\\'s - or rather, Crabbe\\'s - face was contorted with fury.\\r\\n\"What\\'s up with you, Crabbe?\" snapped Malfoy.\\r\\n\"Stomachache,\" Ron grunted.\\r\\n\"Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick\\r\\nfrom me,\" said Malfoy, snickering. \"You know, I\\'m surprised the Daily\\r\\nProphet hasn\\'t reported all these attacks yet,\" he went on thoughtfully.\\r\\n190\\r\\n\"I suppose Dumbledore\\'s trying to hush it all up. He\\'ll be sacked if it\\r\\ndoesn\\'t stop soon. Father\\'s always said old Dumbledore\\'s the worst\\r\\nthing that\\'s ever happened to this place. He loves Muggle-borns. A\\r\\ndecent headmaster would never\\'ve let slime like that Creevey in.\"\\r\\n*222*\\r\\nMalfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a\\r\\ncruel but accurate impression of Colin: \"`Potter, can I have your\\r\\npicture, Potter? Can I have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes,\\r\\nplease, Potter?\"\\'\\r\\nHe dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron.\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter with you two?\"\\r\\nFar too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh, but Malfoy\\r\\nseemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on\\r\\nthe uptake.\\r\\n\"Saint Potter, the Mudbloods\\' friend,\" said Malfoy slowly. \"He\\'s\\r\\nanother one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn\\'t go around\\r\\nwith that jumped up Granger Mudblood. And people think he\\'s\\r\\nSlytherin\\'s heir!\"\\r\\nHarry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely seconds\\r\\naway from telling them it was him - but then\\r\\n\"I wish I knew who it is,\" said Malfoy petulantly. \"I could help them.\"\\r\\nRon\\'s jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than\\r\\nusual. Fortunately, Malfoy didn\\'t notice, and Harry, thinking fast,\\r\\nsaid, \"You must have some idea who\\'s behind it all ......\\r\\n\"You know I haven\\'t, Goyle, how many times do I have to tell you?\"\\r\\nsnapped Malfoy. \"And Father won\\'t tell me anything about the last\\r\\ntime the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty years\\r\\nago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says\\r\\nthat it was all kept quiet and it\\'ll look suspicious if I know too much\\r\\nabout it. But I know one thing - last time the Chamber of Secrets\\r\\nwas opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it\\'s a matter of time before\\r\\none of them\\'s killed this time .... I hope it\\'s Granger,\" he said with\\r\\n191\\r\\nrelish.\\r\\nRon was clenching Crabbe\\'s gigantic fists. Feeling that it would be a\\r\\nbit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning\\r\\nlook and said, \"D\\'you know if the person who opened the Chamber\\r\\nlast time was caught?\"\\r\\n\"Oh, yeah ... whoever it was was expelled,\" said Malfoy. \"They\\'re\\r\\nprobably still in Azkaban.\"\\r\\n\"Azkaban?\" said Harry, puzzled.\\r\\n\"Azkaban - the wizard prison, Goyle,\" said Malfoy, looking at him in\\r\\ndisbelief \"Honestly, if you were any slower, you\\'d be going\\r\\nbackward.\"\\r\\nHe shifted restlessly in his chair and said, \"Father says to keep my\\r\\nhead down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it. He says the\\r\\nschool needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed\\r\\nup in it. Of course, he\\'s got a lot on his plate at the moment. You\\r\\nknow the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week?\"\\r\\nHarry tried to force Goyle\\'s dull face into a look of concern.\\r\\n\"Yeah. . .\" said Malfoy. \"Luckily, they didn\\'t find much. Father\\'s got\\r\\nsome very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But luckily, we\\'ve got our own\\r\\nsecret chamber under the drawing-room floor\\r\\n-\"\\r\\n\"Ho!\" said Ron.\\r\\nMalfoy looked at him. So did Harry. Ron blushed. Even his hair was\\r\\nturning red. His nose was also slowly lengthening - their hour was\\r\\nup, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror\\r\\nhe was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too.\\r\\nThey both jumped to their feet.\\r\\n\"Medicine for my stomach,\" Ron grunted, and without further ado\\r\\nthey sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurled\\r\\nthemselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping\\r\\n192\\r\\nagainst hope that Malfoy hadn\\'t noticed anything. Harry\\r\\n224\\r\\ncould feel his feet slipping around in Goyle\\'s huge shoes and had to\\r\\nhoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the steps into the dark\\r\\nentrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the\\r\\ncloset where they\\'d locked Crabbe and Goyle. Leaving their shoes\\r\\noutside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up the marble\\r\\nstaircase toward Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom.\\r\\n\"Well, it wasn\\'t a complete waste of time,\" Ron panted, closing the\\r\\nbathroom door behind them. \"I know we still haven\\'t found out who\\'s\\r\\ndoing the attacks, but I\\'m going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him\\r\\nto check under the Malfoys\\' drawing room.\"\\r\\nHarry checked his face in the cracked mirror. He was back to normal.\\r\\nHe put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Hermione\\'s\\r\\nstall.\\r\\n\"Hermione, come out, we\\'ve got loads to tell you -\"\\r\\n\"Go away!\" Hermione squeaked.\\r\\nHarry and Ron looked at each other.\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" said Ron. \"You must be back to normal by now,\\r\\nwe are\\r\\nBut Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door. Harry had\\r\\nnever seen her looking so happy.\\r\\n\"Ooooooh, wait till you see,\" she said. \"It\\'s awful-\"\\r\\nThey heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged, sobbing, her\\r\\nrobes pulled up over her head.\\r\\n\"What\\'s up?\" said Ron uncertainly. \"Have you still got Millicent\\'s nose\\r\\nor something?\"\\r\\nHermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink.\\r\\n193\\r\\nHer face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had turned yellow and\\r\\nthere were long, pointed ears poking through her hair.\\r\\n\"It was a c-cat hair!\" she howled. \"M-Millicent Bulstrode\\r\\n*225*\\r\\nm-must have a cat! And the p-potion isn\\'t supposed to be used for\\r\\nanimal transformations!\"\\r\\n\"Uh-oh,\" said Ron.\\r\\n\"You\\'ll be teased something dreadful,\" said Myrtle happily.\\r\\n\"It\\'s okay, Hermione,\" said Harry quickly. \"We\\'ll take you up to the\\r\\nhospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions ......\\r\\nIt took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom.\\r\\nMoaning Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw. \"Wait\\r\\ntill everyone finds out you\\'ve got a tail!\"\\r\\nermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks. There was a\\r\\nflurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school\\r\\narrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course\\r\\neveryone thought that she had been attacked. So many students filed\\r\\npast the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam\\r\\nPomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around\\r\\nHermione\\'s bed, to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry\\r\\nface.\\r\\nHarry and Ron went to visit her every evening. When the new term\\r\\nstarted, they brought her each day\\'s homework.\\r\\n\"If Id sprouted whiskers, Id take a break from work,\" said Ron, tipping\\r\\na stack of books onto Hermione\\'s bedside table one evening.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be silly, Ron, I\\'ve got to keep up,\" said Hermione briskly. Her\\r\\nspirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had\\r\\n* \"21 *\\r\\n194\\r\\ngone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t suppose you\\'ve got any new leads?\" she added in a whisper,\\r\\nso that Madam Pomfrey couldn\\'t hear her.\\r\\n\"Nothing,\" said Harry gloomily.\\r\\n\"I was so sure it was Malfoy,\" said Ron, for about the hundredth time.\\r\\n\"What\\'s that?\" asked Harry, pointing to something gold sticking out\\r\\nfrom under Hermione\\'s pillow.\\r\\n\"Just a get well card,\" said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of\\r\\nsight, but Ron was too quick for her. He pulled it out, flicked it open,\\r\\nand read aloud:\\r\\n\"To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned\\r\\nteacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class,\\r\\nHonorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner\\r\\nof Witch Weekly\\'s Most- Charming-Smile Award. \"\\r\\nRon looked up at Hermione, disgusted.\\r\\n\"You sleep with this under your pillow?\"\\r\\nBut Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping\\r\\nover with her evening dose of medicine.\\r\\n\"Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you\\'ve ever met, or what?\" Ron\\r\\nsaid to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs\\r\\ntoward Gryffindor Tower. Snape had given them so much\\r\\nhomework, Harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before\\r\\nhe finished it. Ron was just saying he wished he had asked Hermione\\r\\nhow many rat tails you were supposed to add to a HairRaising\\r\\nPotion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their\\r\\nears.\\r\\n\"That\\'s Filch,\" Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and\\r\\npaused, out of sight, listening hard.\\r\\n* 228*\\r\\n195\\r\\n\"You don\\'t think someone else\\'s been attacked?\" said Ron tensely.\\r\\nThey stood still, their heads inclined toward Flich\\'s voice, which\\r\\nsounded quite hysterical.\\r\\n`= even more work for me! Mopping all night, like I haven\\'t got enough to\\r\\ndo! No, this is the final straw, I\\'m going to Dumbledore -\"\\r\\nHis footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard a\\r\\ndistant door slam.\\r\\nThey poked their heads around the corner. Filch had clearly been\\r\\nmanning his usual lookout post: They were once again on the spot\\r\\nwhere Mrs. Norris had been attacked. They saw at a glance what\\r\\nFilch had been shouting about. A great flood of water stretched over\\r\\nhalf the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping from\\r\\nunder the door of Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. Now that Filch had\\r\\nstopped shouting, they could hear Myrtle\\'s wails echoing off the\\r\\nbathroom walls.\\r\\n\"Now what\\'s up with her?\" said Ron.\\r\\n\"Let\\'s go and see,\" said Harry, and holding their robes over their\\r\\nankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door\\r\\nbearing its OUT OF ORDER sign, ignored it as always, and entered.\\r\\nMoaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and harder than ever\\r\\nbefore. She seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet. It was dark in\\r\\nthe bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great\\r\\nrush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet.\\r\\n\"What\\'s up, Myrtle?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Who\\'s that?\" glugged Myrtle miserably. \"Come to throw something\\r\\nelse at me?\"\\r\\nHarry waded across to her stall and said, \"Why would I throw\\r\\nsomething at you?\"\\r\\n*229*\\r\\n\"Don\\'t ask me,\" Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave of yet more\\r\\n196\\r\\nwater, which splashed onto the already sopping floor. \"Here I am,\\r\\nminding my own business, and someone thinks it\\'s funny to throw a\\r\\nbook at me ......\\r\\n\"But it can\\'t hurt you if someone throws something at you,\" said\\r\\nHarry, reasonably. \"I mean, it\\'d just go right through you, wouldn\\'t\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\nHe had said the wrong thing. Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked,\\r\\n\"Let\\'s all throw books at Myrtle, because she can\\'t feel it! Ten points\\r\\nif you can get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through\\r\\nher head! Well, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don\\'t think!\"\\r\\n\"Who threw it at you, anyway?\" asked Harry.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know... I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about\\r\\ndeath, and it fell right through the top of my head,\" said Myrtle,\\r\\nglaring at them. \"It\\'s over there, it got washed out ......\\r\\nHarry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing. A\\r\\nsmall, thin book lay there. It had a shabby black cover and was as\\r\\nwet as everything else in the bathroom. Harry stepped forward to\\r\\npick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back.\\r\\n\"What?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Are you crazy?\" said Ron. \"It could be dangerous.\"\\r\\n\"Dangerous?\"said Harry, laughing. \"Come off it, how could it be\\r\\ndangerous?\"\\r\\n\"You\\'d be surprised,\" said Ron, who was looking apprehensively at\\r\\nthe book. \"Some of the books the Ministry\\'s confiscated Dad\\'s told\\r\\nme - there was one that burned your eyes out. And\\r\\n*2%0*\\r\\neveryone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest\\r\\nof their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could\\r\\nnever stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it,\\r\\ntrying to do everything one-handed. And -\"\\r\\n197\\r\\n\"All right, I\\'ve got the point,\" said Harry.\\r\\nThe little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy.\\r\\n\"Well, we won\\'t find out unless we look at it,\" he said, and he ducked\\r\\naround Ron and picked it up off the floor.\\r\\nHarry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover\\r\\ntold him it was fifty years old. He opened it eagerly. On the first page\\r\\nhe could just make out the name \"T M. Riddle\" in smudged ink.\\r\\n\"Hang on,\" said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was looking\\r\\nover Harry\\'s shoulder. \"I know that name .... T. M. Riddle got an\\r\\naward for special services to the school fifty years ago.\"\\r\\n\"How on earth d\\'you know that?\" said Harry in amazement.\\r\\n\"Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in\\r\\ndetention,\" said Ron resentfully. \"That was the one I burped slugs all\\r\\nover. If you\\'d wiped slime off a name for an hour, you\\'d remember it,\\r\\ntoo.\"\\r\\nHarry peeled the wet pages apart. They were completely blank.\\r\\nThere wasn\\'t the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even\\r\\nAuntie Mabel\\'s birthday, or dentist, half-past three.\\r\\n\"He never wrote in it,\" said Harry, disappointed.\\r\\n\"I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?\" said Ron curiously.\\r\\nHarry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name\\r\\nof a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London.\\r\\n*231 *\\r\\n\"He must\\'ve been Muggle-born,\" said Harry thoughtfufly. \"To have\\r\\nbought a diary from Vauxhall Road ......\\r\\n\"Well, it\\'s not much use to you,\" said Ron. He dropped his voice. \"Fifty\\r\\npoints if you can get it through Myrtle\\'s nose.\"\\r\\nHarry, however, pocketed it.\\r\\n198\\r\\nHermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less, and furfree, at\\r\\nthe beginning of February. On her first evening back in Gryffindor\\r\\nTower, Harry showed her T. M. Riddle\\'s diary and told her the story\\r\\nof how they had found it.\\r\\n\"Oooh, it might have hidden powers,\" said Hermione enthusiastically,\\r\\ntaking the diary and looking at it closely.\\r\\n\"If it has, it\\'s hiding them very well,\" said Ron. \"Maybe it\\'s shy. I don\\'t\\r\\nknow why you don\\'t chuck it, Harry.\"\\r\\n\"I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,\" said Harry. \"I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services\\r\\nto Hogwarts either.\"\\r\\n\"Could\\'ve been anything,\" said Ron. \"Maybe he got thirty O.WL.s or\\r\\nsaved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that\\r\\nwould\\'ve done everyone a favor .....\\r\\nBut Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione\\'s face that\\r\\nshe was thinking what he was thinking.\\r\\n\"What?\" said Ron, looking from one to the other.\\r\\n\"Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn\\'t it?\"\\r\\nhe said. \"That\\'s what Malfoy said.\"\\r\\n\"Yeah. . .\" said Ron slowly.\\r\\n\"And this diary is fifty years old,\" said Hermione, tapping it excitedly.\\r\\n*232*\\r\\na so?\\r\\n.\\r\\n\"Oh, Ron, wake up,\" snapped Hermione. \"We know the person who\\r\\nopened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. We know\\r\\nT. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years\\r\\nago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of\\r\\n199\\r\\nSlytherin? His diary would probably tell us everything - where the\\r\\nChamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it -\\r\\nthe person who\\'s behind the attacks this time wouldn\\'t want that lying\\r\\naround, would they?\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s a brilliant theory, Hermione,\" said Ron, \"with just one tiny little\\r\\nflaw. There\\'s nothing written in his diary.\"\\r\\nBut Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag.\\r\\n\"It might be invisible ink!\" she whispered.\\r\\nShe tapped the diary three times and said, \"Aparecium!\"\\r\\nNothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into\\r\\nher bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser.\\r\\n\"It\\'s a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,\" she said.\\r\\nShe rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened.\\r\\n\"I\\'m telling you, there\\'s nothing to find in there,\" said Ron. \"Riddle just\\r\\ngot a diary for Christmas and couldn\\'t be bothered filling it in.\"\\r\\nHarry couldn\\'t explain, even to himself, why he didn\\'t just throw\\r\\nRiddle\\'s diary away. The fact was that even though he knew the diary\\r\\nwas blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages,\\r\\nas though it were a story he wanted to finish. And while Harry was\\r\\nsure he had never heard the name T. M. Riddle before, it still seemed\\r\\nto mean something to him, almost as though\\r\\n* 233 *\\r\\nRiddle was a friend he\\'d had when he was very small, and had\\r\\nhalfforgotten. But this was absurd. He\\'d never had friends before\\r\\nHogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that.\\r\\nNevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so\\r\\nnext day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle\\'s\\r\\nspecial award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a\\r\\nthoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he\\'d seen enough of the\\r\\ntrophy room to last him a lifetime.\\r\\n200\\r\\nRiddle\\'s burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. It\\r\\ndidn\\'t carry details of why it had been given to him (\"Good thing, too,\\r\\nor it\\'d be even bigger and Id still be polishing it,\" said Ron). However,\\r\\nthey did find Riddle\\'s name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on\\r\\na list of old Head Boys.\\r\\n\"He sounds like Percy,\" said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust.\\r\\n\"Prefect, Head Boy ... probably top of every class -\"\\r\\n\"You say that like it\\'s a bad thing,\" said Hermione in a slightly hurt\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\nThe sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. Inside\\r\\nthe castle, the mood had grown more hopeful. There had been no\\r\\nmore attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and\\r\\nMadam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were\\r\\nbecoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving\\r\\nchildhood.\\r\\n\"The moment their acne clears up, they\\'ll be ready for repotting again,\"\\r\\nHarry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. \"And after that, it\\r\\nwon\\'t be long until we\\'re cutting them up and stewing them. You\\'ll\\r\\nhave Mrs. Norris back in no time.\"\\r\\n* 243 *\\r\\nPerhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry.\\r\\nIt must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets,\\r\\nwith the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster,\\r\\nwhatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate for\\r\\nanother fifty years ....\\r\\nErnie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn\\'t take this cheerful view. He was\\r\\nstill convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had \"given\\r\\nhimself away\" at the Dueling Club. Peeves wasn\\'t helping matters; he\\r\\nkept popping up in the crowded corridors singing \"Oh, Potter, you\\r\\nrotter . . .\" now with a dance routine to match.\\r\\nGilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks\\r\\nstop. Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while the\\r\\nGryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration.\\r\\n201\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think there\\'ll be any more trouble, Minerva,\" he said, tapping\\r\\nhis nose knowingly and winking. \"I think the Chamber has been locked\\r\\nfor good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter\\r\\nof time before I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before I\\r\\ncame down hard on him.\\r\\n\"You know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. Wash\\r\\naway the memories of last term! I won\\'t say any more just now, but I\\r\\nthink I know just the thing . . . .\"\\r\\nHe tapped his nose again and strode off.\\r\\nLockhart\\'s idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on\\r\\nFebruary fourteenth. Harry hadn\\'t had much sleep because of a laterunning\\r\\nQuidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to\\r\\nthe Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment, that he\\'d\\r\\nwalked through the wrong doors.\\r\\nThe walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse\\r\\n* 235*\\r\\nstill, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry\\r\\nwent over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking\\r\\nsickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles.\\r\\n\"What\\'s going on?\" Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti\\r\\noff his bacon.\\r\\nRon pointed to the teachers\\' table, apparently too disgusted to speak.\\r\\nLockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was\\r\\nwaving for silence. The teachers on either side of him were looking\\r\\nstony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall\\'s cheek. Snape looked as though someone had\\r\\njust fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro.\\r\\n\"Happy Valentine\\'s Day!\" Lockhart shouted. \"And may I thank the\\r\\nforty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the\\r\\nliberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn\\'t end\\r\\nhere!\"\\r\\n202\\r\\nLockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall\\r\\nmarched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however.\\r\\nLockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps.\\r\\n\"My friendly, card-carrying cupids!\" beamed Lockhart. \"They will be\\r\\nroving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fun\\r\\ndoesn\\'t stop here! I\\'m sure my colleagues will want to enter into the\\r\\nspirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how\\r\\nto whip up a Love Potion! And while you\\'re at it, Professor Flitwick\\r\\nknows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I\\'ve\\r\\never met, the sly old dog!\"\\r\\nProfessor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was look\\r\\n* 236\\r\\ning as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be\\r\\nforce-fed poison.\\r\\n\"Please, Hermione, tell me you weren\\'t one of the forty-six, 51 said Ron\\r\\nas they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly\\r\\nbecame very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and\\r\\ndidn\\'t answer.\\r\\nAll day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver\\r\\nvalentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as\\r\\nthe Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs\\r\\ncaught up with Harry.\\r\\n\"Oy, you! \\'Arty Potter!\" shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf,\\r\\nelbowing people out of the way to get to Harry.\\r\\nHot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line\\r\\nof first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried\\r\\nto escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by\\r\\nkicking people\\'s shins, and reached him before he\\'d gone two paces.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got a musical message to deliver to \\'Arry Potter in person,\" he\\r\\nsaid, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way.\\r\\n\"Not here,\" Harry hissed, trying to escape.\\r\\n203\\r\\n\"Stay still!\" grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry\\'s bag and pulling\\r\\nhim back.\\r\\n\"Let me go!\" Harry snarled, tugging.\\r\\nWith a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His books, wand,\\r\\nparchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed\\r\\nover everything.\\r\\nHarry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf\\r\\nstarted singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor.\\r\\n*237*\\r\\n\"What\\'s going on here?\" came the cold, drawling voice of Draco\\r\\nMalfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped\\r\\nbag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical\\r\\nvalentine.\\r\\n\"What\\'s all this commotion?\" said another familiar voice as Percy\\r\\nWeasley arrived.\\r\\nLosing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf\\r\\nseized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.\\r\\n\"Right,\" he said, sitting on Harry\\'s ankles. \"Here is your singing\\r\\nvalentine:\\r\\nHis eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,\\r\\nHis hair is as dark as a blackboard.\\r\\nI wish he was mine, he\\'s really divine,\\r\\nThe hero who conquered the Dark Lord\\r\\nHarry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the\\r\\nspot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his\\r\\nfeet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his\\r\\nbest to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth.\\r\\n\"Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class,\\r\\nnow,\" he said, shooing some of the younger students away. \"And you,\\r\\nMalfoy-\"\\r\\n204\\r\\nHarry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something.\\r\\nLeering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that\\r\\nhe\\'d got Riddle\\'s diary.\\r\\n\"Give that back,\" said Harry quietly.\\r\\n\"Wonder what Potter\\'s written in this?\" said Malfoy, who obvi\\r\\n* 238\\r\\nously hadn\\'t noticed the year on the cover and thought he had\\r\\nHarry\\'s own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring\\r\\nfrom the diary to Harry, looking terrified.\\r\\n\"Hand it over, Malfoy,\" said Percy sternly.\\r\\n\"When I\\'ve had a look,\" said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\nPercy said, \"As a school prefect -\" but Harry had lost his temper. He\\r\\npulled out his wand and shouted, \"Expelliarmus!\" and just as\\r\\nSnape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting\\r\\nout of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.\\r\\n\"Harry!\" said Percy loudly. \"No magic in the corridors. I\\'ll have to\\r\\nreport this, you know!\"\\r\\nBut Harry didn\\'t care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth\\r\\nfive points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, and\\r\\nas Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after\\r\\nher, \"I don\\'t think Potter liked your valentine much!\"\\r\\nGinny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling,\\r\\nRon pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away. Ron didn\\'t\\r\\nneed to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs.\\r\\nIt wasn\\'t until they had reached Professor Flitwick\\'s class that Harry\\r\\nnoticed something rather odd about Riddle\\'s diary. All his other\\r\\nbooks were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as\\r\\nclean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He\\r\\ntried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his\\r\\n205\\r\\nwand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end,\\r\\nand he wasn\\'t much interested in anything else.\\r\\nHarry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This\\r\\nwas partly because he didn\\'t think he could stand Fred and George\\r\\nsinging, \"His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad\" one more time,\\r\\nand partly because he wanted to examine Riddle\\'s diary again, and\\r\\nknew that Ron thought he was wasting his time.\\r\\nHarry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not\\r\\none of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new\\r\\nbottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a\\r\\nblot onto the first page of the diary.\\r\\nThe ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it\\r\\nwas being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up\\r\\nhis quill a second time and wrote, \"My name is Harry Potter.\"\\r\\nThe words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without\\r\\ntrace. Then, at last, something happened.\\r\\nOozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry\\r\\nhad never written.\\r\\n\"Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by my\\r\\ndiary?\"\\r\\nThese words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to\\r\\nscribble back.\\r\\n\"Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.\"\\r\\nHe waited eagerly for Riddle\\'s reply.\\r\\n\"Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink.\\r\\nBut I always knew that there would be those who would not want this\\r\\ndiary read. \"\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his\\r\\nexcitement.\\r\\n*240*\\r\\n206\\r\\n`I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were\\r\\ncovered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and\\r\\nWizardry. \"\\r\\n\"That\\'s where I am now,\" Harry wrote quickly. \"I\\'m at Hogwarts, and\\r\\nhorrible stuff\\'s been happening. Do you know anything about the\\r\\nChamber of Secrets?\"\\r\\nHis heart was hammering. Riddle\\'s reply came quickly, his writing\\r\\nbecoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.\\r\\n\"Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it\\r\\nwas a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the\\r\\nChamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally\\r\\nkilling one. I caught the person whod opened the Chamber and he was\\r\\nexpelled. But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing\\r\\nhad happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given\\r\\nout that thegirl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny,\\r\\nengraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I\\r\\nknew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the\\r\\npower to release it was not imprisoned. \"\\r\\nHarry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.\\r\\n\"It\\'s happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one\\r\\nseems to know who\\'s behind them. Who was it last time?\"\\r\\n\"I can show you, if you like, \"came Riddle\\'s reply. \"You don\\'t have\\r\\nto take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night\\r\\nwhen I caught him. \"\\r\\nHarry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle\\r\\nmean? How could he be taken inside somebody else\\'s memory? He\\r\\nglanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was\\r\\n*241*\\r\\ngrowing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words\\r\\nforming.\\r\\n207\\r\\n\"Let me show you. \"\\r\\nHarry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters.\\r\\n(40K.55\\r\\nThe pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind,\\r\\nstopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open,\\r\\nHarry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have\\r\\nturned into a miniscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly,\\r\\nhe raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and\\r\\nbefore he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the\\r\\nwindow was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was\\r\\npitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color\\r\\nand shadow.\\r\\nHe felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred\\r\\nshapes around him came suddenly into focus.\\r\\nHe knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the\\r\\nsleeping portraits was Dumbledore\\'s office - but it wasn\\'t Dumbledore\\r\\nwho was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, fraillooking wizard, bald\\r\\nexcept for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by\\r\\ncandlelight. Harry had never seen this man before.\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" he said shakily. \"I didn\\'t mean to butt in -\"\\r\\nBut the wizard didn\\'t look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly.\\r\\nHarry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, \"Er - I\\'ll just go, shall\\r\\nI?\"\\r\\nStill the wizard ignored him. He didn\\'t seem even to have heard him.\\r\\nThinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice.\\r\\n*242*\\r\\n\"Sorry I disturbed you. I\\'ll go now,\" he half-shouted.\\r\\nThe wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past\\r\\nHarry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his\\r\\nwindow.\\r\\n208\\r\\nThe sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset.\\r\\nThe wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs,\\r\\nwatching the door.\\r\\nHarry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirring\\r\\nsilver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it,\\r\\nmeaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore,\\r\\nand he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to\\r\\nthe people of fifty years ago.\\r\\nThere was a knock on the office door.\\r\\n\"Enter,\" said the old wizard in a feeble voice.\\r\\nA boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver\\r\\nprefect\\'s badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than\\r\\nHarry, but he, too, had jet-black hair.\\r\\n\"Ah, Riddle,\" said the Headmaster.\\r\\n\"You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?\" said Riddle. He looked\\r\\nnervous.\\r\\n\"Sit down,\" said Dippet. \"I\\'ve just been reading the letter you sent me.\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very\\r\\ntightly.\\r\\n\"My dear boy,\" said Dipper kindly, \"I cannot possibly let you stay at\\r\\nschool over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the\\r\\nholidays?\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Riddle at once. \"Id much rather stay at Hogwarts than go\\r\\nback to that - to that -\"\\r\\n* 243*\\r\\n\"You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?\" said\\r\\nDippet curiously.\\r\\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle, reddening slightly.\\r\\n209\\r\\n\"You are Muggle-born?\"\\r\\n\"Half-blood, sir,\" said Riddle. \"Muggle father, witch mother.\"\\r\\n\"And are both your parents -?\"\\r\\n\"My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the\\r\\norphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after my\\r\\nfather, Marvolo after my grandfather.\"\\r\\nDipper clucked his tongue sympathetically.\\r\\n\"The thing is, Tom,\" he sighed, \"Special arrangements might have\\r\\nbeen made for you, but in the current circumstances . . . .\"\\r\\n\"You mean all these attacks, sir?\" said Riddle, and Harry\\'s heart\\r\\nleapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything.\\r\\n\"Precisely,\" said the headmaster. \"My dear boy, you must see how\\r\\nfoolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when\\r\\nterm ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy ... the death of\\r\\nthat poor little girl .... You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As\\r\\na matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about\\r\\nclosing the school. We are no nearer locating the er - source of all\\r\\nthis unpleasantness . . . .\"\\r\\nRiddle\\'s eyes had widened.\\r\\n\"Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped -\"\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting\\r\\nup in his chair. \"Riddle, do you mean you know something about\\r\\nthese attacks?\"\\r\\n\"No, sir,\" said Riddle quickly.\\r\\nBut Harry was sure it was the same sort of \"no\" that he himself had\\r\\ngiven Dumbledore.\\r\\n*244*\\r\\nDippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed.\\r\\n210\\r\\n\"You may go, Tom ......\\r\\nRiddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Harry\\r\\nfollowed him.\\r\\nDown the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the\\r\\ngargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so did\\r\\nHarry, watching him. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some\\r\\nserious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.\\r\\nThen, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off,\\r\\nHarry gliding noiselessly behind him. They didn\\'t see another person\\r\\nuntil they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long,\\r\\nsweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble\\r\\nstaircase.\\r\\n\"What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?\"\\r\\nHarry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-yearyounger\\r\\nDumbledore.\\r\\n\"I had to see the headmaster, sir,\" said Riddle.\\r\\n\"Well, hurry off to bed,\" said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly the\\r\\nkind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. \"Best not to roam the\\r\\ncorridors these days. Not since . . .\"\\r\\nHe sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddle\\r\\nwatched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed\\r\\nstraight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot\\r\\npursuit.\\r\\nBut to Harry\\'s disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hidden\\r\\npassageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which\\r\\nHarry had Potions with Snape. The torches hadn\\'t been lit, and when\\r\\nRiddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just\\r\\n*2 45 *\\r\\nsee him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside.\\r\\n211\\r\\nIt felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he could\\r\\nsee was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack,\\r\\nwaiting like a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feeling\\r\\nexpectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present,\\r\\nhe heard something move beyond the door.\\r\\nSomeone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it was\\r\\npass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a\\r\\nshadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind\\r\\nhim, forgetting that he couldn\\'t be heard.\\r\\nFor perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddle\\r\\nstopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises.\\r\\nHarry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a\\r\\nhoarse whisper.\\r\\n\"C\\'mon ... gotta get yeh outta here .... C\\'mon now ... in the box. . .\"\\r\\nThere was something familiar about that voice ....\\r\\nRiddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped out behind\\r\\nhim. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching\\r\\nin front of an open door, a very large box next to it.\\r\\n\"Evening, Rubeus,\" said Riddle sharply.\\r\\nThe boy slammed the door shut and stood up.\\r\\n\"What yer doin\\' down here, Tom?\"\\r\\nRiddle stepped closer.\\r\\n\"It\\'s all over,\" he said. \"I\\'m going to have to turn you in, Rubeus.\\r\\nThey\\'re talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don\\'t stop.\"\\r\\n4 6\\r\\n\"N\" at d\\'yeh -\"\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don\\'t make\\r\\ngood pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and -\"\\r\\n212\\r\\n\"It never killed no one!\" said the large boy, backing against the\\r\\nclosed door. From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and\\r\\nclicking.\\r\\n\"Come on, Rubeus,\" said Riddle, moving yet closer. \"The dead girl\\'s\\r\\nparents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make\\r\\nsure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered ......\\r\\n\"It wasn\\'t him!\" roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark\\r\\npassage. \"He wouldn\\'! He never!\"\\r\\n\"Stand aside,\" said Riddle, drawing out his wand.\\r\\nHis spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind\\r\\nthe large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall\\r\\nopposite. And out of it came something that made Harry let out a\\r\\nlong, piercing scream unheard by anyone\\r\\nA vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of\\r\\nmany eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers - Riddle raised his\\r\\nwand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it\\r\\nscuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle\\r\\nscrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the\\r\\nhuge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down,\\r\\nyelling, \"NO000000!\"\\r\\nThe scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself\\r\\nfalling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster\\r\\nin the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle\\'s diary lying open on his stomach.\\r\\n*24 7*\\r\\nBefore he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door\\r\\nopened and Ron came in.\\r\\n\"There you are,\" he said.\\r\\nHarry sat up. He was sweating and shaking.\\r\\n\"What\\'s up?\" said Ron, looking at him with concern.\\r\\n\"It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty\\r\\n213\\r\\nyears ago.\"\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an\\r\\nunfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first\\r\\nyear at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden\\r\\nhouse, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, threeheaded\\r\\ndog he\\'d christened \"Fluffy.\" And if, as a boy, Hagrid had\\r\\nheard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was\\r\\nsure he\\'d have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He\\'d probably\\r\\nthought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so\\r\\nlong, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs;\\r\\nHarry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a\\r\\nleash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Hagrid would\\r\\nnever have meant to kill anybody.\\r\\nHarry half wished he hadn\\'t found out how to work Riddle\\'s diary.\\r\\nAgain and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what\\r\\nhe\\'d seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the\\r\\nlong, circular conversations that followed.\\r\\n\"Riddle might have got the wrong person,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe it\\r\\nwas some other monster that was attacking people . . . .\"\\r\\n\"How many monsters d\\'you think this place can hold?\" Ron asked\\r\\ndully.\\r\\n\"We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,\" said Harry miserably.\\r\\n\"And the attacks must\\'ve stopped after Hagrid was kicked out.\\r\\nOtherwise, Riddle wouldn\\'t have got his award.\"\\r\\nRon tried a different tack.\\r\\n\"Riddle does sound like Percy - who asked him to squeal on Hagrid,\\r\\nanyway?\"\\r\\n\"But the monster had killed someone, Ron,\" said Hermione.\\r\\n\"And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they\\r\\nclosed Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I don\\'t blame him for wanting to stay\\r\\nhere ......\\r\\n214\\r\\n\"You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn\\'t you, Harry?\"\\r\\n\"He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,\" said Harry quickly.\\r\\nThe three of them fell silent. After a long pause, Hermione voiced the\\r\\nknottiest question of all in a hesitant voice.\\r\\n\"Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?\"\\r\\n\"That\\'d be a cheerful visit,\" said Ron. \"\\'Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have\\r\\nyou been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?\"\\'\\r\\nIn the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid\\r\\nunless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by\\r\\nwith no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became\\r\\nhopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had\\r\\nbeen expelled. It was now nearly four months since Justin and Nearly\\r\\nHeadless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to\\r\\nthink that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Peeves\\r\\nhad finally got bored of his \"Oh, Potter, you rotter\" song, Ernie\\r\\nMacmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping\\r\\ntoadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the\\r\\nMandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This\\r\\nmade Professor Sprout very happy.\\r\\n\"The moment they start trying to move into each other\\'s pots, we\\'ll\\r\\nknow they\\'re fully mature,\" she told Harry. \"Then we\\'ll be able to\\r\\nrevive those poor people in the hospital wing.\"\\r\\nThe second years were given something new to think about during\\r\\ntheir Easter holidays. The time had come to choose their subjects for\\r\\nthe third year, a matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously.\\r\\n\"it could affect our whole future,\" she told Harry and Ron as they\\r\\npored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks.\\r\\n\"I just want to give up Potions,\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"We can\\'t,\" said Ron gloomily. \"We keep all our old subjects, or I\\'d\\'ve\\r\\nditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.\"\\r\\n215\\r\\n\"But that\\'s very important!\" said Hermione, shocked.\\r\\n\"Not the way Lockhart teaches it,\" said Ron. \"I haven\\'t learned\\r\\nanything from him except not to set pixies loose.\"\\r\\nNeville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and\\r\\nwizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what to\\r\\nchoose. Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with\\r\\nhis tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy\\r\\nsounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes. Dean\\r\\nThomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up\\r\\nclosing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the\\r\\nsubjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody\\'s advice but signed up for\\r\\neverything.\\r\\nHarry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon\\r\\nand Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in\\r\\nwizardry with them. Not that he didn\\'t get any guidance: Percy\\r\\nWeasley was eager to share his experience.\\r\\n\"Depends where you want to go, Harry,\" he said. \"It\\'s never too early\\r\\nto think about the future, so Id recommend Divination. People say\\r\\nMuggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should\\r\\nhave a thorough understanding of the non-magical community,\\r\\nparticularly if they\\'re thinking of working in close contact with them -\\r\\nlook at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My\\r\\nbrother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for\\r\\nCare of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Harry.\"\\r\\nBut the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In\\r\\nthe end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was\\r\\nlousy at them, at least he\\'d have someone friendly to help him.\\r\\nGryffindor\\'s next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood\\r\\nwas insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry\\r\\nbarely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However,\\r\\nthe training sessions were getting better, or at least\\r\\ndrier, and the evening before Saturday\\'s match he went up to his\\r\\ndormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor\\'s chances for\\r\\nthe Quidditch cup had never been better.\\r\\n216\\r\\nBut his cheerful mood didn\\'t last long. At the top of the stairs to the\\r\\ndormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic.\\r\\n\"Harry - I don\\'t know who did it - I just found -\"\\r\\nWatching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the door.\\r\\nThe contents of Harry\\'s trunk had been thrown everywhere. His\\r\\ncloak lay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off his\\r\\nfour-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside\\r\\ncabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress.\\r\\nHarry walked over to the bed, open-mouthed, treading on a few\\r\\nloose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and Neville pulled the\\r\\nblankets back onto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in. Dean\\r\\nswore loudly.\\r\\n\"What happened, Harry?\"\\r\\n\"No idea,\" said Harry. But Ron was examining Harry\\'s robes. All the\\r\\npockets were hanging out.\\r\\n\"Someone\\'s been looking for something,\" said Ron. \"Is there anything\\r\\nmissing?\"\\r\\nHarry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk.\\r\\nIt was only as he threw the last of the Lockhart books back into it\\r\\nthat he realized what wasn\\'t there.\\r\\n\"Riddle\\'s diary\\'s gone,\" he said in an undertone to Ron.\\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\nHarry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followed\\r\\nhim out. They hurried down to the Gryffindor common\\r\\nroom, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting\\r\\nalone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy.\\r\\nHermione looked aghast at the news.\\r\\n217\\r\\n\"But - only a Gryffindor could have stolen - nobody else knows our\\r\\npassword -\"\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" said Harry.\\r\\nThey woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing\\r\\nbreeze.\\r\\n\"Perfect Quidditch conditions!\" said Wood enthusiastically at the\\r\\nGryffindor table, loading the team\\'s plates with scrambled eggs.\\r\\n\"Harry, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast.\"\\r\\nHarry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering\\r\\nif the new owner of Riddle\\'s diary was right in front of his eyes.\\r\\nHermione had been urging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn\\'t\\r\\nlike the idea. He\\'d have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and how\\r\\nmany people knew why Hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago? He\\r\\ndidn\\'t want to be the one who brought it all up again.\\r\\nAs he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his\\r\\nQuidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Harry\\'s\\r\\ngrowing list. He had just set foot on the marble staircase when he\\r\\nheard it yet again\\r\\n\"Kill this time ... let me rip ... tear. . .\"\\r\\nHe shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from him\\r\\nin alarm.\\r\\n\"The voice!\" said Harry, -looking over his shoulder. \"I just heard it\\r\\nagain - didn\\'t you?\"\\r\\nRon shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however, clapped a\\r\\nhand to her forehead.\\r\\n\"Harry - I think I\\'ve just understood something! I\\'ve got to go to the\\r\\nlibrary!\"\\r\\nAnd she sprinted away, up the stairs.\\r\\n\"What does she understand?\" said Harry distractedly, still looking\\r\\naround, trying to tell where the voice had come from.\\r\\n218\\r\\n\"Loads more than I do,\" said Ron, shaking his head.\\r\\n\"But why\\'s she got to go to the library?\"\\r\\n\"Because that\\'s what Hermione does,\" said Ron, shrugging. \"When in\\r\\ndoubt, go to the library.\"\\r\\nHarry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people\\r\\nwere now emerging from the Great Hall behind him, talking loudly,\\r\\nexiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.\\r\\n\"You\\'d better get moving,\" said Ron. \"It\\'s nearly eleven - the match -\\r\\n\"\\r\\nHarry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus Two\\r\\nThousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds,\\r\\nbut his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and\\r\\nas he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker. room, his only comfort\\r\\nwas that everyone was now outside to watch the game.\\r\\nThe teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. Oliver\\r\\nWood took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; Madam\\r\\nHooch released the balls. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary\\r\\nyellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of\\r\\ntactics.\\r\\nHarry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGonagall\\r\\ncame half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an\\r\\nenormous purple megaphone.\\r\\nHarry\\'s heart dropped like a stone.\\r\\n\"This match has been cancelled,\" Professor McGonagall called\\r\\nthrough the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium. There were\\r\\nboos and shouts. Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and ran\\r\\ntoward Professor McGonagall without getting off his broomstick.\\r\\n\"But, Professor!\" he shouted. \"We\\'ve got to play - the cup\\r\\nGryffindor -\"\\r\\n219\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her\\r\\nmegaphone:\\r\\n\"All students are to make their way back to the House common\\r\\nrooms, where their Heads of Houses will give them further\\r\\ninformation. As quickly as you can, please!\"\\r\\nThen she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her.\\r\\n\"Potter, I think you\\'d better come with me ......\\r\\nWondering how she could possibly suspect him this time, Harry saw\\r\\nRon detach himself from the complaining crowd; he came running up\\r\\nto them as they set off toward the castle. To Harry\\'s surprise,\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall didn\\'t object.\\r\\n\"Yes, perhaps you\\'d better come, too, Weasley .....\\r\\nSome of the students swarming around them were grumbling about\\r\\nthe match being canceled; others looked worried. Harry and Ron\\r\\nfollowed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up the\\r\\nmarble staircase. But they weren\\'t taken to anybody\\'s office this time.\\r\\n\"This will be a bit of a shock,\" said Professor McGonagall in a\\r\\nsurprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. \"There has\\r\\nbeen another attack ... another double attack.\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s insides did a horrible somersault. Professor McGonagall\\r\\npushed the door open and he and Ron entered. .\\r\\nMadam Pomfrey was bending over a fifth-year girl with long, curly\\r\\nhair. Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they\\'d accidentally\\r\\nasked for directions to the Slytherin common room. And on the bed\\r\\nnext to her was\\r\\n\"Hermione!\" Ron groaned.\\r\\nHermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy.\\r\\n\"They were found near the library,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I\\r\\ndon\\'t suppose either of you can explain this? It was on the floor next\\r\\nto them ......\\r\\n220\\r\\nShe was holding up a small, circular mirror.\\r\\nHarry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Hermione.\\r\\n\"I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,\" said Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall heavily. \"I need to address the students in any case.\\r\\n\"All students will return to their House common rooms by six o\\'clock\\r\\nin the evening. No student is to leave the dormitories after that time.\\r\\nYou will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to use\\r\\nthe bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All further Quidditch\\r\\ntraining and matches are to be postponed. There will be no more\\r\\nevening activities.\"\\r\\nThe Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor\\r\\nMcGonagall in silence. She rolled up the parchment\\r\\nfrom which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked\\r\\nvoice, \"I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed. It is\\r\\nlikely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these\\r\\nattacks is caught. I would urge anyone who thinks they might know\\r\\nanything about them to come forward.\"\\r\\nShe climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and the\\r\\nGryffindors began talking immediately.\\r\\n\"That\\'s two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, one\\r\\nRavenclaw, and one Hufflepuff, \" said the Weasley twins\\' friend Lee\\r\\nJordan, counting on his fingers. \"Haven\\'t any of the teachers noticed\\r\\nthat the Slytherins are all safe? Isn\\'t it obvious all this stuff\\'s coming\\r\\nfrom Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin - why\\r\\ndon\\'t they just chuck all the Slytherins out?\" he roared, to nods and\\r\\nscattered applause.\\r\\nPercy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once he didn\\'t\\r\\nseem keen to make his views heard. He was looking pale and stunned.\\r\\n\"Percy\\'s in shock,\" George told Harry quietly. \"That Ravenclaw girl -\\r\\nPenelope Clearwater - she\\'s a prefect. I don\\'t think he thought the\\r\\nmonster would dare attack a prefect.\"\\r\\n221\\r\\nBut Harry was only half-listening. He didn\\'t seem to be able to get rid\\r\\nof the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as though carved\\r\\nout of stone. And if the culprit wasn\\'t caught soon, he was looking at a\\r\\nlifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in\\r\\nbecause he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the\\r\\nschool closed. Harry now knew exactly how he had felt.\\r\\n\"What\\'re we going to do?\" said Ron quietly in Harry\\'s ear. \"D\\'you\\r\\nthink they suspect Hagrid?\"\\r\\n\"We\\'ve got to go and talk to him,\" said Harry, making up his\\r\\nmind. \"I can\\'t believe it\\'s him this time, but if he set the monster\\r\\nloose last time he\\'ll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets,\\r\\nand that\\'s a start.\"\\r\\n\"But McGonagall said we\\'ve got to stay in our tower unless we\\'re\\r\\nin class -\"\\r\\n\"I think,\" said Harry, more quietly still, \"it\\'s time to get my dad\\'s\\r\\nold cloak out again.\"\\r\\nHarry had inherited) ust one thing from his father: a long and sil\\r\\nvery Invisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out of\\r\\nthe school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it. They\\r\\nwent to bed at the usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and Sea\\r\\nmus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally\\r\\nfallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak over\\r\\nthemselves.\\r\\nThe journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors\\r\\nwasn\\'t enjoyable. Harry, who had wandered the castle at night sev\\r\\neral times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. Teach\\r\\ners, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs,\\r\\nstaring around for any unusual activity. Their Invisibility Cloak\\r\\ndidn\\'t stop them making any noise, and there was a particularly\\r\\ntense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot\\r\\nwhere Snape stood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at\\r\\nalmost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with relief that they\\r\\nreached the oak front doors and eased them open.\\r\\nIt was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windows\\r\\nof Hagrid\\'s house and pulled off the cloak only when they were\\r\\nright outside his front door.\\r\\nSeconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open. They found\\r\\nthemselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them. Fang\\r\\n222\\r\\nthe boarhound barked loudly behind him.\\r\\n\"Oh,\" he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. \"What\\'re\\r\\nyou two doin\\' here?\"\\r\\n\"What\\'s that for?\" said Harry, pointing at the crossbow as they\\r\\nstepped inside.\\r\\n\"Nothin\\' - nothin\\' - \" Hagrid muttered. \"I\\'ve bin expectin\\' doesn\\'\\r\\nmatter - Sit down - I\\'ll make tea -\"\\r\\nHe hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He nearly\\r\\nextinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then\\r\\nsmashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand.\\r\\n\"Are you okay, Hagrid?\" said Harry. \"Did you hear about\\r\\nHermione?\"\\r\\n\"Oh, I heard, all righ\\',\" said Hagrid, a slight break in his voice.\\r\\nHe kept glancing nervously at the windows. He poured them both\\r\\nlarge mugs of boiling water (he had forgotten to add tea bags) and\\r\\nwas just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud\\r\\nknock on the door.\\r\\nHagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and Ron exchanged\\r\\npanicstricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over\\r\\nthemselves and retreated into a corner. Hagrid checked that they\\r\\nwere hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door once\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\"Good evening, Hagrid.\"\\r\\nIt was Dumbledore. He entered, looking deadly serious, and was\\r\\nfollowed by a second, very odd-looking man.\\r\\nThe stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and\\r\\nwas wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, a\\r\\nscarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his arm\\r\\nhe carried a lime-green bowler.\\r\\n223\\r\\n\"That\\'s Dad\\'s boss!\" Ron breathed. \"Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of\\r\\nMagic!\"\\r\\nHarry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.\\r\\nHagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his chairs\\r\\nand looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge.\\r\\n\"Bad business, Hagrid,\" said Fudge in rather clipped tones. \"Very bad\\r\\nbusiness. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things\\'ve gone\\r\\nfar enough. Ministry\\'s got to act.\"\\r\\n\"I never,\" said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. \"You know I\\r\\nnever, Professor Dumbledore, sir -\"\\r\\n\"I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,\"\\r\\nsaid Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge.\\r\\n\"Look, Albus,\" said Fudge, uncomfortably. \"Hagrid\\'s record\\'s against\\r\\nhim. Ministry\\'s got to do something - the school governors have been\\r\\nin touch -\"\\r\\n\"Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help\\r\\nin the slightest,\" said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were full of a fire\\r\\nHarry had never seen before.\\r\\n\"Look at it from my point of view,\" said Fudge, fidgeting with his\\r\\nbowler. \"I\\'m under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doing\\r\\nsomething. If it turns out it wasn\\'t Hagrid, he\\'ll be back and no more\\r\\nsaid. But I\\'ve got to take him. Got to. Wouldn\\'t be doing my duty -\"\\r\\n\"Take me?\" said Hagrid, who was trembling. \"Take me where?\"\\r\\n\"For a short stretch only,\" said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid\\'s eyes. \"Not\\r\\na punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught,\\r\\nyou\\'ll be let out with a full apology -\"\\r\\n\"Not Azkaban?\" croaked Hagrid.\\r\\nBefore Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door.\\r\\n224\\r\\nDumbledore answered it. It was Harry\\'s turn for an elbow in the ribs;\\r\\nhe\\'d let out an audible gasp.\\r\\nMr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid\\'s hut, swathed in a long black\\r\\ntraveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. Fang started to\\r\\ngrowl.\\r\\n\"Already here, Fudge,\" he said approvingly. \"Good, good. . .\"\\r\\n\"What\\'re you doin\\' here?\" said Hagrid furiously. \"Get outta my house!\"\\r\\n\"My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being\\r\\ninside your - er - d\\'you call this a house?\" said Lucius Malfoy, sneering\\r\\nas he looked around the small cabin. \"I simply called at the school and\\r\\nwas told that the headmaster was here.\"\\r\\n\"And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?\" said Dumbledore.\\r\\nHe spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes.\\r\\n\"Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,\" said Malfoy lazily, taking out a long roll\\r\\nof parchment, \"but the governors feel it\\'s time for you to step aside.\\r\\nThis is an Order of Suspension - you\\'ll find all twelve signatures on it.\\r\\nI\\'m afraid we feel you\\'re losing your touch. How many attacks have\\r\\nthere been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn\\'t it? At this rate,\\r\\nthere\\'ll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what\\r\\nan awful loss that would be to the school.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, now, see here, Lucius,\" said Fudge, looking alarmed,\\r\\n\"Dumbledore suspended - no, no - last thing we want just now\\r\\n262\\r\\n\"The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter for\\r\\nthe governors, Fudge,\" said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. \"And as\\r\\nDumbledore has failed to stop these attacks -\"\\r\\n\"See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can\\'t stop them,\" said Fudge, whose\\r\\nupper lip was sweating now, \"I mean to say, who can?\"\\r\\n\"That remains to be seen,\" said Mr. Malfoy with a nasty smile. \"But as\\r\\nall twelve of us have voted -\"\\r\\n225\\r\\nHagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling.\\r\\n\\'An\\' how many did yeh have ter threaten an\\' blackmail before they\\r\\nagreed, Malfoy, eh?\" he roared.\\r\\n\"Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble\\r\\none of these days, Hagrid,\" said Mr. Malfoy. \"I would advise you not\\r\\nto shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won\\'t like it at all.\"\\r\\n\"Yeh can\\' take Dumbledore!\" yelled Hagrid, making Fang the\\r\\nboarhound cower and whimper in his basket. \"Take him away, an\\' the\\r\\nMuggle-borns won\\' stand a chance! There\\'ll be killin\\' next!\"\\r\\n\"Calm yourself, Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore sharply. He looked at\\r\\nLucius Malfoy.\\r\\n\"If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside\\r\\n-\"\\r\\n\"But -\" stuttered Fudge.\\r\\n\"No!\"growled Hagrid.\\r\\nDumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy\\'s\\r\\ncold gray ones.\\r\\n\"However,\" said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that\\r\\nnone of them could miss a word, \"you will find that I will\\r\\n* 26$*\\r\\nummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake\\r\\nalike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into\\r\\nbloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castle\\r\\nwindows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn\\'t\\r\\nlook right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle,\\r\\nwhere things were so horribly wrong.\\r\\nHarry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now\\r\\nbarred from the hospital wing.\\r\\n226\\r\\n\"We\\'re taking no more chances,\" Madam Pomfrey told them severely\\r\\nthrough a crack in the infirmary door. \"No, I\\'m sorry, there\\'s every\\r\\nchance the attacker might come back to finish these people off . . .\"\\r\\nWith Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the\\r\\nsun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned\\r\\nwindows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school\\r\\n* 265*\\r\\nthat didn\\'t look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through\\r\\nthe corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.\\r\\nHarry constantly repeated Dumbledore\\'s final words to himself \"I will\\r\\nonly truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me... Help will\\r\\nalways be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\" But what good\\r\\nwere these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help,\\r\\nwhen everyone was just as confused and scared as they were?\\r\\nHagrid\\'s hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the\\r\\ntrouble was, there didn\\'t seem to be a single spider left in the castle to\\r\\nfollow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly)\\r\\nby Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren\\'t\\r\\nallowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle\\r\\nin a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students\\r\\nseemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by\\r\\nteachers, but Harry found it very irksome.\\r\\nOne person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the\\r\\natmosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting\\r\\naround the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy.\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions\\r\\nlesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when,\\r\\nsitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe\\r\\nand Goyle.\\r\\n\"I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of\\r\\nDumbledore,\" he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. \"I told you\\r\\nhe thinks Dumbledore\\'s the worst headmaster the school\\'s ever\\r\\n227\\r\\n*266*\\r\\nhad. Maybe we\\'ll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won\\'t\\r\\nwant the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall won\\'t last long,\\r\\nshe\\'s only filling in ......\\r\\nSnape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione\\'s\\r\\nempty seat and cauldron.\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said Malfoy loudly. \"Sir, why don\\'t you apply for the\\r\\nheadmaster\\'s job?\"\\r\\n\"Now, now, Malfoy,\" said Snape, though he couldn\\'t suppress a thinlipped\\r\\nsmile. \"Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the\\r\\ngovernors. I daresay he\\'ll be back with us soon enough.\"\\r\\n\"Yeah, right,\" said Malfoy, smirking. \"I expect you\\'d have Father\\'s\\r\\nvote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job - I\\'ll tell Father you\\'re the\\r\\nbest teacher here, sir -\"\\r\\nSnape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not\\r\\nspotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into his\\r\\ncauldron.\\r\\n\"I\\'m quite surprised the Mudbloods haven\\'t all packed their bags by\\r\\nnow,\" Malfoy went on. \"Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pity\\r\\nit wasn\\'t Granger -\"\\r\\nThe bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy\\'s last\\r\\nwords, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags\\r\\nand books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed.\\r\\n\"Let me at him,\" Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t care, I don\\'t need my wand, I\\'m going to kill him with my bare\\r\\nhands -\"\\r\\n\"Hurry up, I\\'ve got to take you all to Herbology,\" barked Snape over\\r\\nthe class\\'s heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean\\r\\nbringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only\\r\\n* 261*\\r\\n228\\r\\nsafe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle and\\r\\nthey were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the\\r\\ngreenhouses.\\r\\nThe Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing\\r\\nfrom their number, Justin and Hermione.\\r\\nProfessor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian\\r\\nShrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the\\r\\ncompost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan.\\r\\nErnie took a deep breath and said, very formally, \"I just want to say,\\r\\nHarry, that I\\'m sorry I ever suspected you. I know you\\'d never attack\\r\\nHermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I said. We\\'re all in\\r\\nthe same boat now, and, well -\"\\r\\nHe held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it.\\r\\nErnie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as\\r\\nHarry and Ron.\\r\\n\"That Draco Malfoy character,\" said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs,\\r\\n\"he seems very pleased about all this, doesn\\'t he? D\\'you know, I think\\r\\nhe might be Slytherin\\'s heir.\"\\r\\n\"That\\'s clever of you,\" said Ron, who didn\\'t seem to have forgiven\\r\\nErnie as readily as Harry.\\r\\n\"Do you think it\\'s Malfoy, Harry?\" Ernie asked.\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared.\\r\\nA second later, Harry spotted something.\\r\\nSeveral large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side\\r\\nof the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the\\r\\nshortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit Ron over the hand\\r\\nwith his pruning shears.\\r\\n\"Ouch! What\\'re you -\"\\r\\n268\\r\\n229\\r\\nHarry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes\\r\\nscrewed up against the sun.\\r\\n\"Oh, yeah,\" said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased. \"But we can\\'t\\r\\nfollow them now -\"\\r\\nErnie and Hannah were listening curiously.\\r\\nHarry\\'s eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pursued\\r\\ntheir fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would\\r\\nend up.\\r\\n\"Looks like they\\'re heading for the Forbidden Forest . . . .\"\\r\\nAnd Ron looked even unhappier about that.\\r\\nAt the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their\\r\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged behind\\r\\nthe others so they could talk out of earshot.\\r\\n\"We\\'ll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,\" Harry told Ron. \"We\\r\\ncan take Fang with us. He\\'s used to going into the forest with Hagrid,\\r\\nhe might be some help.\"\\r\\n\"Right,\" said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers.\\r\\n\"Er - aren\\'t there - aren\\'t there supposed to be werewolves in the\\r\\nforest?\" he added as they took their usual places at the back of\\r\\nLockhart\\'s classroom.\\r\\nPreferring not to answer that question, Harry said, \"There are good\\r\\nthings in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns ...\\r\\nRon had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Harry had\\r\\nentered it only once and had hoped never to do so again.\\r\\nLockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him. Every\\r\\nother teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but\\r\\nLockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant.\\r\\n2 69\\r\\n\"Come now,\" he cried, beaming around him. \"Why all these long\\r\\n230\\r\\nfaces?\"\\r\\nPeople swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you people realize,\" said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as though\\r\\nthey were all a bit dim, \"the danger has passed! The culprit has been\\r\\ntaken away -\"\\r\\n\"Says who?\" said Dean Thomas loudly.\\r\\n\"My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn\\'t have taken\\r\\nHagrid if he hadn\\'t been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,\"\\r\\nsaid Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one\\r\\nmade two.\\r\\n\"Oh, yes he would,\" said Ron, even more loudly than Dean.\\r\\n\"I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid\\'s arrest than you\\r\\ndo, Mr. Weasley,\" said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone.\\r\\nRon started to say that he didn\\'t think so, somehow, but stopped in\\r\\nmidsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk.\\r\\n\"We weren\\'t there, remember?\" Harry muttered.\\r\\nBut Lockhart\\'s disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always\\r\\nthought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole business\\r\\nwas now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw\\r\\nGadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart\\'s stupid face. Instead he\\r\\ncontented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let\\'s do it tonight.\\r\\nRon read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the\\r\\nempty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his\\r\\nresolve, and he nodded.\\r\\nThe Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days,\\r\\nbecause from six o\\'clock onward the Gryffindors had no -\\r\\n*270*\\r\\nwhere else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result\\r\\nthat the common room often didn\\'t empty until past midnight.\\r\\n231\\r\\nHarry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after\\r\\ndinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to\\r\\nclear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of\\r\\nExploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in\\r\\nHermione\\'s usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying\\r\\nto finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight\\r\\nwhen Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed.\\r\\nHarry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors\\r\\nclosing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and\\r\\nclimbing through the portrait hole.\\r\\nIt was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the\\r\\nteachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on\\r\\nthe oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any\\r\\ncreaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.\\r\\n\"\\'Course,\" said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass,\\r\\n\"we might get to the forest and find there\\'s nothing to follow. Those\\r\\nspiders might not\\'ve been going there at all. I know it looked like they\\r\\nwere moving in that sort of general direction, but. . .\"\\r\\nHis voice trailed away hopefully.\\r\\nThey reached Hagrid\\'s house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank\\r\\nwindows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy\\r\\nat the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle\\r\\nwith his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge from\\r\\na tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together.\\r\\nHarry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid\\'s table. There would be no\\r\\nneed for it in the pitch-dark forest.\\r\\n* 21:L *\\r\\n\"C\\'mon, Fang, we\\'re going for a walk,\" said Harry, patting his leg, and\\r\\nFang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the\\r\\nedge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.\\r\\nHarry took out his wand, murmured, \"Lumos!\" and a tiny light\\r\\nappeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for\\r\\n232\\r\\nsigns of spiders.\\r\\n\"Good thinking,\" said Ron. \"Id light mine, too, but you know - it\\'d\\r\\nprobably blow up or something ......\\r\\nHarry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary\\r\\nspiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the\\r\\ntrees.\\r\\n\"Okay,\" Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, \"I\\'m ready. Let\\'s\\r\\ngo.\"\\r\\nSo, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves,\\r\\nthey entered the forest. By the glow of Harry\\'s wand, they followed\\r\\nthe steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked\\r\\nbehind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for\\r\\nnoises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the\\r\\ntrees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were\\r\\nno longer visible, and Harry\\'s wand shone alone in the sea of dark,\\r\\nthey saw their spider guides leaving the path.\\r\\nHarry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but\\r\\neverything outside his little sphere of *light was pitch-black. He had\\r\\nnever been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly\\r\\nremember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time\\r\\nhe\\'d been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in\\r\\na cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders.\\r\\n* 2-V2 *\\r\\nSomething wet touched Harry\\'s hand and he jumped backward,\\r\\ncrushing Rods foot, but it was only Fang\\'s nose.\\r\\n\"What d\\'you reckon?\" Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just\\r\\nmake out, reflecting the light from his wand.\\r\\n\"We\\'ve come this far,\" said Ron.\\r\\nSo they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees.\\r\\nThey couldn\\'t move very quickly now; there were tree roots and\\r\\nstumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry could\\r\\nfeel Fang\\'s hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop,\\r\\n233\\r\\nso that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.\\r\\nThey walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes\\r\\nsnagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they\\r\\nnoticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the\\r\\ntrees were as thick as ever.\\r\\nThen Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry\\r\\nand Ron jump out of their skins.\\r\\n\"What?\" said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and\\r\\ngripping Harry\\'s elbow very hard.\\r\\n\"There\\'s something moving over there,\" Harry breathed. \"Listen ...\\r\\nsounds like something big ......\\r\\nThey listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was\\r\\nsnapping branches as it carved a path through the trees.\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said Ron. \"Oh, no, oh, no, oh -\"\\r\\n\"Shut up,\" said Harry frantically. \"It\\'ll hear you.\"\\r\\n\"Hear me?\" said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. \"It\\'s already heard\\r\\nFang!\"\\r\\nThe darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they\\r\\n* 273*\\r\\nstood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then\\r\\nsilence.\\r\\n\"What d\\'you think it\\'s doing?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Probably getting ready to pounce,\" said Ron.\\r\\nThey waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.\\r\\n\"D\\'you think it\\'s gone?\" Harry whispered.\\r\\n\"Dunno -\"\\r\\n234\\r\\nThen, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the\\r\\ndarkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes.\\r\\nFang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and\\r\\nyelped even louder.\\r\\n\"Harry!\" Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief \"Harry, it\\'s our\\r\\ncar!\"\\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n\"Come on!\"\\r\\nHarry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping,\\r\\nand a moment later they had emerged into a clearing.\\r\\nMr. Weasley\\'s car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of\\r\\nthick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. As\\r\\nRon walked, open-mouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him,\\r\\nexactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner.\\r\\n\"It\\'s been here all the time!\" said Ron delightedly, walking around the\\r\\ncar. \"Look at it. The forest\\'s turned it wild . . . .\"\\r\\nThe sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud.\\r\\nApparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own.\\r\\nFang didn\\'t seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who could\\r\\nfeel him quivering. His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed\\r\\nhis wand back into his robes.\\r\\n*214*\\r\\n\"And we thought it was going to attack us!\" said Ron, leaning against\\r\\nthe car and patting it. \"I wondered where it had gone!\"\\r\\nHarry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders,\\r\\nbut they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights.\\r\\n\"We\\'ve lost the trail,\" he said. \"C\\'mon, let\\'s go and find them.\"\\r\\nRon didn\\'t speak. He didn\\'t move. His eyes were fixed on a point\\r\\nsome ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face was\\r\\n235\\r\\nlivid with terror.\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t even have time to turn around. There was a loud clicking\\r\\nnoise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around\\r\\nthe middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging\\r\\nfacedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron\\'s\\r\\nlegs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling - next\\r\\nmoment, he was being swept away into the dark trees.\\r\\nHead hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on\\r\\nsix immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below\\r\\na pair of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of\\r\\nthe creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very\\r\\nheart of the forest. Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from\\r\\na third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn\\'t have yelled even if\\r\\nhe had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car\\r\\nin the clearing.\\r\\nHe never knew how long he was in the creature\\'s clutches; he only\\r\\nknew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the\\r\\nleaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his neck\\r\\nsideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge of\\r\\n*21$*\\r\\na vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars\\r\\nshone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on.\\r\\nSpiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below.\\r\\nSpiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy,\\r\\ngigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way\\r\\ndown the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of\\r\\nthe hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their\\r\\npincers excitedly at the sight of its load.\\r\\nHarry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron\\r\\nand Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn\\'t howling anymore,\\r\\nbut cowering silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt.\\r\\nHis mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes\\r\\nwere popping.\\r\\nHarry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was\\r\\n236\\r\\nsaying something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his\\r\\npincers with every word he spoke.\\r\\n\"Aragog!\" it called. \"Aragog!\"\\r\\nAnd from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a\\r\\nsmall elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of\\r\\nhis body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was\\r\\nmilky white. He was blind.\\r\\n\"What is it?\" he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.\\r\\n\"Men,\" clicked the spider who had caught Harry.\\r\\n\"Is it Hagrid?\" said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes\\r\\nwandering vaguely.\\r\\n\"Strangers,\" clicked the spider who had brought Ron.\\r\\n\"Kill them,\" clicked Aragog fretfully. \"I was sleeping ......\\r\\n\"We\\'re friends of Hagrid\\'s,\" Harry shouted. His heart seemed to have\\r\\nleft his chest to pound in his throat.\\r\\n*216*\\r\\nClick, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow.\\r\\nAragog paused.\\r\\n\"Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,\" he said slowly.\\r\\n\"Hagrid\\'s in trouble,\" said Harry, breathing very fast. \"That\\'s why\\r\\nwe\\'ve come.\"\\r\\n\"In trouble?\" said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern\\r\\nbeneath the clicking pincers. \"But why has he sent you?\"\\r\\nHarry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn\\'t\\r\\nthink his legs would support him. So he spoke from the ground, as\\r\\ncalmly as he could.\\r\\n237\\r\\n\"They think,, up at the school, that Hagrid\\'s been setting a a -\\r\\nsomething on students. They\\'ve taken him to Azkaban.\"\\r\\nAragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the\\r\\nsound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause,\\r\\nexcept applause didn\\'t usually make Harry feel sick with fear.\\r\\n\"But that was years ago,\" said Aragog fretfully. \"Years and years ago.\\r\\nI remember it well. That\\'s why they made him leave the school. They\\r\\nbelieved that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the\\r\\nChamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had opened the\\r\\nChamber and set me free.\"\\r\\n\"And you ... you didn\\'t come from the Chamber of Secrets?\" said\\r\\nHarry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead.\\r\\n\"I!\" said Aragog, clicking angrily. \"I was not born in the castle. I come\\r\\nfrom a distant land. A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg.\\r\\nHagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in\\r\\nthe castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid\\r\\n2Y\\r\\nis my good friend, and a good man. When I was discovered, and\\r\\nblamed for the death of a girl, he protected me. I have lived here in\\r\\nthe forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me. He even found me\\r\\na wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through\\r\\nHagrid\\'s goodness ......\\r\\nHarry summoned what remained of his courage.\\r\\n\"So you never - never attacked anyone?\"\\r\\n\"Never,\" croaked the old spider. \"It would have been my instinct, but\\r\\nout of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body of the\\r\\ngirl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any\\r\\npart of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our kind like\\r\\nthe dark and the quiet ......\\r\\n\"But then ... Do you know what did kill that girl?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Because whatever it is, it\\'s back and attacking people again -\"\\r\\n238\\r\\nHis words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the\\r\\nrustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted\\r\\nall around him.\\r\\n\"The thing that lives in the castle,\" said Aragog, \"is an ancient creature\\r\\nwe spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded\\r\\nwith Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the\\r\\nschool.\"\\r\\n\"What is it?\" said Harry urgently.\\r\\nMore loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.\\r\\n\"We do not speak of it!\" said Aragog fiercely. \"We do not name it! I\\r\\nnever even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he\\r\\nasked me, many times.\"\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t want to press the subject, not with the spiders\\r\\n* 2-V8 *\\r\\npressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of tamng. He\\r\\nwas backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders\\r\\ncontinued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron.\\r\\n\"We\\'ll just go, then,\" Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing\\r\\nleaves rustling behind him.\\r\\n\"Go?\" said Aragog slowly. \"I think not ......\\r\\n\"But - but -\"\\r\\n\"My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I\\r\\ncannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our\\r\\nmidst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.\"\\r\\nHarry spun around. Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wall\\r\\nof spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads.\\r\\nEven as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good, there\\r\\nwere too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting,\\r\\na loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the\\r\\n239\\r\\nhollow.\\r\\nMr. Weasley\\'s car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring,\\r\\nits horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto\\r\\ntheir backs, their endless legs waving in the air. The car screeched to\\r\\na halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open.\\r\\n\"Get Fang!\" Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the\\r\\nboarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of\\r\\nthe car - the doors slammed shut - Ron didn\\'t touch the accelerator\\r\\nbut the car didn\\'t need him; the engine roared and they were off,\\r\\nhitting more spiders. They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and\\r\\nthey were soon crashing through the forest, branches\\r\\nwhipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the\\r\\nwidest gaps, following a path it obviously knew.\\r\\nHarry looked sideways at Ron. His mouth was still open in the silent\\r\\nscream, but his eyes weren\\'t popping anymore.\\r\\n\"Are you okay?\"\\r\\nRon stared straight ahead, unable to speak.\\r\\nThey smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly\\r\\nin the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they\\r\\nsqueezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees\\r\\nthinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky.\\r\\nThe car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the\\r\\nwindshield. They had reached the edge of the forest. Fang flung\\r\\nhimself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry\\r\\nopened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid\\'s house, tail\\r\\nbetween his legs. Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron\\r\\nseemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-necked\\r\\nand staring. Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into\\r\\nthe forest and disappeared from view.\\r\\nHarry went back into Hagrid\\'s cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak. Fang\\r\\nwas trembling under a blanket in his basket. When Harry got outside\\r\\nagain, he found Ron being violently sick in the pumpkin patch.\\r\\n240\\r\\n\"Follow the spiders,\" said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve.\\r\\n\"I\\'ll never forgive Hagrid. We\\'re lucky to be alive.\"\\r\\n\"I bet he thought Aragog wouldn\\'t hurt friends of his,\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"That\\'s exactly Hagrid\\'s problem!\" said Ron, thumping the wall of the\\r\\ncabin. \"He always thinks monsters aren\\'t as bad as they\\'re\\r\\n*280*\\r\\nmade out, and look where it\\'s got him! A cell in Azkaban!\" He was\\r\\nshivering uncontrollably now. \"What was the point of sending us in\\r\\nthere? What have we found out, Id like to know?\"\\r\\n\"That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Harry,\\r\\nthrowing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him\\r\\nwalk. \"He was innocent.\"\\r\\nRon gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard\\r\\nwasn\\'t his idea of being innocent.\\r\\nAs the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure\\r\\ntheir feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar.\\r\\nThey walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the\\r\\nmarble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors where\\r\\nwatchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the safety of the\\r\\nGryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into\\r\\nglowing ash. They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to\\r\\ntheir dormitory.\\r\\nRon fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry,\\r\\nhowever, didn\\'t feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his fourposter,\\r\\nthinking hard about everything Aragog had said.\\r\\nThe creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought,\\r\\nsounded like a sort of monster Voldemort - even other monsters didn\\'t\\r\\nwant to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it\\r\\nwas, or how it Petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never known\\r\\nwhat was in the Chamber of Secrets.\\r\\nHarry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his\\r\\npillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window.\\r\\n241\\r\\nHe couldn\\'t see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends\\r\\n*281*\\r\\neverywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of\\r\\nSlytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same\\r\\nperson, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time.\\r\\nThere was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still thinking about\\r\\nwhat Aragog had said.\\r\\nHe was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last\\r\\nhope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright.\\r\\n\"Ron,\" he hissed through the dark, \"Ron -\"\\r\\nRon woke with a yelp like Fang\\'s, stared wildly around, and saw\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\n\"Ron -that girl who died. Aragog said she was found in a bathroom,\"\\r\\nsaid Harry, ignoring Neville\\'s snufing snores from the corner. \"What\\r\\nif she never left the bathroom? What if she\\'s still there?\"\\r\\nRon rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then he\\r\\nunderstood, too.\\r\\n\"You don\\'t think - not Moaning Myrtle?\"\\r\\nA ll those times we were in that bathroom, and she was just\\r\\nthree toilets away,\" said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day,\\r\\n\"and we could\\'ve asked her, and now. . .\"\\r\\nIt had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. Escaping their\\r\\nteachers long enough to sneak into a girls\\' bathroom, the girls\\' bathroom,\\r\\nmoreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be\\r\\nalmost impossible.\\r\\nBut something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drove\\r\\nthe Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks.\\r\\nTen minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told them that their\\r\\nexams would start on the first of June, one week from today.\\r\\n242\\r\\n`Exams?\" howled Seamus Finnigan. \"We\\'re still getting exams?\"\\r\\nThere was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom\\'s wand\\r\\nslipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk. Professorr\\r\\n*28%*\\r\\nMcGonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned,\\r\\nfrowning, to Seamus.\\r\\n\"The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to\\r\\nreceive your education,\" she said sternly. \"The exams will therefore\\r\\ntake place as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard.\"\\r\\nStudying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that there would be\\r\\nexams with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of mutinous\\r\\nmuttering around the room, which made Professor McGonagall scowl\\r\\neven more darkly.\\r\\n\"Professor Dumbledore\\'s instructions were to keep the school running\\r\\nas normally as possible, she said. \"And that, I need hardly point out,\\r\\nmeans finding out how much you have learned this year.\\r\\nHarry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be\\r\\nturning into slippers. What had he learned so far this year? He couldn\\'t\\r\\nseem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam.\\r\\nRon looked as though he\\'d just been told he had to go and live in the\\r\\nForbidden Forest.\\r\\n\"Can you imagine me taking exams with this?\" he asked Harry, holding\\r\\nup his wand, which had just started whistling loudly.\\r\\nThree days before their first exam, Professor McGonagall made\\r\\nanother announcement at breakfast.\\r\\n\"I have good news,\" she said, and the Great Hall, instead of falling\\r\\nsilent, erupted.\\r\\n243\\r\\n\"Dumbledore\\'s coming back!\" several people yelled joyfully.\\r\\n\"You\\'ve caught the Heir of Slytherin!\" squealed a girl at the\\r\\nRavenclaw table.\\r\\n284*\\r\\n\"Quidditch matches are back on!\" roared Wood excitedly.\\r\\nWhen the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said,\\r\\n\"Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for\\r\\ncutting at last. Tonight, we will be able to revive those people who\\r\\nhave been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that one of them may\\r\\nwell be able to tell us who, or what, attacked them. I am hopeful that\\r\\nthis dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit.\"\\r\\nThere was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over at the\\r\\nSlytherin table and wasn\\'t at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy\\r\\nhadn\\'t joined in. Ron, however, was looking happier than he\\'d looked in\\r\\ndays.\\r\\n\"It won\\'t matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!\" he said to Harry.\\r\\n\"Hermione\\'ll probably have all the answers when they wake her up!\\r\\nMind you, she\\'ll go crazy when she finds out we\\'ve got exams in three\\r\\ndays\\' time. She hasn\\'t studied. It might be kinder to leave her where\\r\\nshe is till they\\'re over.\"\\r\\nJust then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron. She\\r\\nlooked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands were\\r\\ntwisting in her lap.\\r\\n\"What\\'s up?\" said Ron, helping himself to more porridge.\\r\\nGinny didn\\'t say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor\\r\\ntable with a scared look on her face that reminded Harry of someone,\\r\\nthough he couldn\\'t think who.\\r\\n\"Spit it out,\" said Ron, watching her.\\r\\nHarry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She was rocking\\r\\nbackward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Dobby did\\r\\nwhen he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information.\\r\\n244\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got to tell you something,\" Ginny mumbled, carefully not looking at\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\n\"What is it?\" said Harry.\\r\\nGinny looked as though she couldn\\'t find the right words.\\r\\n\"What?\"said Ron.\\r\\nGinny opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Harry leaned\\r\\nforward and spoke quietly, so that only Ginny and Ron could hear him.\\r\\n\"Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have you seen\\r\\nsomething? Someone acting oddly?\"\\r\\nGinny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Percy Weasley\\r\\nappeared, looking tired and wan.\\r\\n\"If you\\'ve finished eating, I\\'ll take that seat, Ginny. I\\'m starving, I\\'ve\\r\\nonly just come off patrol duty.\"\\r\\nGinny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified, gave\\r\\nPercy a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away. Percy sat\\r\\ndown and grabbed a mug from the center of the table.\\r\\n\"Percy!\" said Ron angrily. \"She was just about to tell us some-\\' thing\\r\\nimportant!\"\\r\\nHalfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked.\\r\\n\"What sort of thing?\" he said, coughing.\\r\\n\"I just asked her if she\\'d seen anything odd, and she started to say\\r\\n\"Oh - that - that\\'s nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets,\" said\\r\\nPercy at once.\\r\\n\"How do you know?\" said Ron, his eyebrows raised.\\r\\n\"Well, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked in on me the other day\\r\\nwhen I was - well, never mind - the point is, she spot\\r\\n245\\r\\nted me doing something and I, um, I asked her not to mention it to\\r\\nanybody. I must say, I did think she\\'d keep her word. It\\'s nothing,\\r\\nreally, Id just rather -\"\\r\\nHarry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable.\\r\\n\"What were you doing, Percy?\" said Ron, grinning. \"Go on, tell us, we\\r\\nwon\\'t laugh.\"\\r\\nPercy didn\\'t smile back.\\r\\n\"Pass me those rolls, Harry, I\\'m starving.\"\\r\\nHarry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without\\r\\ntheir help, but he wasn\\'t about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle\\r\\nif it turned up - and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were\\r\\nbeing led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart.\\r\\nLockhart, who had so often assured them that all danger had passed,\\r\\nonly to be proved wrong right away, was now wholeheartedly\\r\\nconvinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safely\\r\\ndown the corridors. His hair wasn\\'t as sleek as usual; it seemed he\\r\\nhad been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth floor.\\r\\n\"Mark my words,\" he said, ushering them around a corner. \"The first\\r\\nwords out of those poor Petrified people\\'s mouths will be It was\\r\\nHagrid.\\' Frankly, I\\'m astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all\\r\\nthese security measures are necessary.\"\\r\\n(ti agree, sir,\" said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise.\\r\\n\"Thank you, Harry, said Lockhart graciously while they waited for a\\r\\nlong line of Hufflepuffs to pass. \"I mean, we teachers have quite\\r\\nenough to be getting on with, without walking students to classes and\\r\\nstanding guard all night ......\\r\\n\"That\\'s right,\" said Ron, catching on. \"Why don\\'t you leave us here, sir,\\r\\nwe\\'ve only got one more corridor to go -\"\\r\\n\"You know, Weasley, I think I will,\" said Lockhart. \"I really should go\\r\\nand prepare my next class -\"\\r\\n246\\r\\nAnd he hurried off.\\r\\n\"Prepare his class,\" Ron sneered after him. \"Gone to curl his hair,\\r\\nmore like.\"\\r\\nThey let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them, then darted\\r\\ndown a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle\\'s\\r\\nbathroom. But just as they were congratulating each other on their\\r\\nbrilliant scheme\\r\\n\"Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?\"\\r\\nIt was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the thinnest of thin\\r\\nlines.\\r\\n\"We were -we were-\" Ron stammered. \"We were going to - to go and\\r\\nsee -\"\\r\\n\"Hermione,\" said Harry. Ron and Professor McGonagall both looked\\r\\nat him.\\r\\n\"We haven\\'t seen her for ages, Professor,\" Harry went on hurriedly,\\r\\ntreading on Ron\\'s foot, \"and we thought we\\'d sneak into the hospital\\r\\nwing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er,\\r\\nnot to worry -\"\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for a moment,\\r\\nHarry thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was in\\r\\na strangely croaky voice.\\r\\n\"Of course,\" she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her\\r\\nbeady eye. \"Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends\\r\\nof those who have been ... I quite understand. Yes,\\r\\nPotter, of course you may visit Miss Granger. I will inform Professor\\r\\nBinns where you\\'ve gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my\\r\\npermission.\"\\r\\nHarry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they\\'d\\r\\navoided detention. As they turned the corner, they distinctly heard\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall blow her nose.\\r\\n247\\r\\n\"That,\" said Ron fervently, \"was the best story you\\'ve ever come up\\r\\nwith.\"\\r\\nThey had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam\\r\\nPomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall\\'s permission to visit\\r\\nHermione.\\r\\nMadam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly.\\r\\n\"There\\'s just no point talking to a Petrified. person,\" she said, and they\\r\\nhad to admit she had a point when they\\'d taken their seats next to\\r\\nHermione. It was plain that Hermione didn\\'t have the faintest inkling\\r\\nthat she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedside\\r\\ncabinet not to worry for all the good it would do.\\r\\n\"Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?\" said Ron, looking sadly\\r\\nat Hermione\\'s rigid face. \"Because if he sneaked up on them all, no\\r\\none\\'ll ever know . .....\\r\\nBut Harry wasn\\'t looking at Hermione\\'s face. He was more interested\\r\\nin her right hand. It lay clenched on top of her blankets, and bending\\r\\ncloser, he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fist.\\r\\nMaking sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, he pointed this\\r\\nout to Ron.\\r\\n\"TG and get it out,\" Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he\\r\\nblocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey\\'s view.\\r\\nIt was no easy task. Hermione\\'s hand was clamped so tightly around\\r\\nthe paper that Harry was sure he was going to tear it. While Ron kept\\r\\nwatch he tugged and twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes,\\r\\nthe paper came free.\\r\\nIt was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry smoothed it out\\r\\neagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too.\\r\\nOf the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land,\\r\\nthere is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk,\\r\\nknown also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may\\r\\nreach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born\\r\\n248\\r\\nfrom a chicken\\'s egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are\\r\\nmost wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk\\r\\nhas a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall\\r\\nsuffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal\\r\\nenemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is\\r\\nfatal to it.\\r\\nAnd beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Harry\\r\\nrecognized as Hermione\\'s. Pipes.\\r\\nIt was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain.\\r\\n\"Ron,\" he breathed. \"This is it. This is the answer. The monster in the\\r\\nChamber\\'s a basilisk - a giant serpent! That why I\\'ve been hearing\\r\\nthat voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it. It\\'s because\\r\\nI understand Parseltongue . . . .\"\\r\\nHarry looked up at the beds around him.\\r\\n\"The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no one\\'s died -\\r\\nbecause no one looked it straight in the eye. Colin saw it through his\\r\\ncamera. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got\\r\\nPetrified. Justin . . . Justin must\\'ve seen the basilisk through Nearly\\r\\nHeadless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he couldn\\'t die again .\\r\\n. . and Hermione and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a\\r\\nmirror next to them. Hermione had just realized the monster was a\\r\\nbasilisk. I bet you anything she warned the first person she met to\\r\\nlook around corners with a mirror first! And that girl pulled out her\\r\\nmirror - and -\"\\r\\nRods jaw had dropped.\\r\\n\"And Mrs. Norris?\" he whispered eagerly.\\r\\nHarry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Halloween.\\r\\n\"The water. . .\" he said slowly. \"The flood from Moaning Myrtle\\'s\\r\\nbathroom. I bet you Mrs. Norris only saw the reflection . . . .\"\\r\\nHe scanned the page in his hand eagerly. The more he looked at it,\\r\\nthe more it made sense.\\r\\n249\\r\\n`: . . The crowing of the rooster . . . is fatal to it\"! he read aloud. \"Hagrid\\'s\\r\\nroosters were killed! The Heir of Slytherin didn\\'t want one anywhere\\r\\nnear the castle once the Chamber was opened! Spidersflee before it.! It\\r\\nall fits!\"\\r\\n\"But how\\'s the basilisk been getting around the place?\" said Ron. \"A\\r\\ngiant snake . . . Someone would\\'ve seen. . .\"\\r\\nHarry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at the\\r\\nfoot of the page.\\r\\n\"Pipes,\" he said. \"Pipes . . . Ron, it\\'s been using the plumbing. I\\'ve\\r\\nbeen hearing that voice inside the walls . . . .\"\\r\\n291*\\r\\nRon suddenly grabbed Harry\\'s arm.\\r\\n\"The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!\" he said hoarsely.\\r\\n\"What if it\\'s a bathroom? What if it\\'s in -\"\\r\\n`= Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom, \"said Harry.\\r\\nThey sat there, excitement coursing through them, hardly able\\r\\nto believe it.\\r\\n\"This means,\" said Harry, \"I can\\'t be the only Parselmouth in\\r\\nthe school. The Heir of Slytherin\\'s one, too. That\\'s how he\\'s been\\r\\ncontrolling the basilisk.\"\\r\\n\"What\\'re we going to do?\" said Ron, whose eyes were flashing.\\r\\n\"Should we go straight to McGonagall?\"\\r\\n\"Let\\'s go to the staff room,\" said Harry, jumping up. \"She\\'ll be\\r\\nthere in ten minutes. It\\'s nearly break.\"\\r\\nThey ran downstairs. Not wanting to be discovered hanging\\r\\naround in another corridor, they went straight into the deserted\\r\\nstaff room. It was a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs.\\r\\nHarry and Ron paced around it, too excited to sit down.\\r\\nBut the bell to signal break never came.\\r\\nInstead, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGon\\r\\nagall\\'s voice, magically magnified.\\r\\n`All students to return to their House dormitories at once. All teach\\r\\ners return to the staff room. Immediately, please. \"\\r\\nHarry wheeled around to stare at Ron.\\r\\n\"Not another attack? Not now?\"\\r\\n250\\r\\n\"What\\'ll we do?\" said Ron, aghast. \"Go back to the dormitory?\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Harry, glancing around. There was an ugly sort of\\r\\nwardrobe to his left, full of the teachers\\' cloaks. \"In here. Let\\'s hear\\r\\nwhat it\\'s all about. Then we can tell them what we\\'ve found out.\"\\r\\nThey hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds of\\r\\npeople moving overhead, and the staff room door banging open.\\r\\nFrom between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the\\r\\nteachers filtering into the room. Some of them were looking puzzled,\\r\\nothers downright scared. Then Professor McGonagall arrived.\\r\\n\"It has happened,\" she told the silent staff room. \"A student has been\\r\\ntaken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself.\"\\r\\nProfessor Flitwick let out a squeal. Professor Sprout clapped her\\r\\nhands over her mouth. Snape gripped the back of a chair very hard\\r\\nand said, \"How can you be sure?\"\\r\\n\"The Heir of Slytherin,\" said Professor McGonagall, who was very\\r\\nwhite, \"left another message. Right underneath the first one. `Her\\r\\nskeleton will lie in the Chamber forever. \"\\'\\r\\nProfessor Flitwick burst into tears.\\r\\n\"Who is it?\" said Madam Hooch, who had sunk, weak-kneed, into a\\r\\nchair. \"Which student?\"\\r\\n\"Ginny Weasley,\" said Professor McGonagall.\\r\\nHarry felt Ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor beside\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\"We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow,\" said\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall. \"This is the end of Hogwarts. Dumbledore\\r\\nalways said. . .\"\\r\\nThe staffroom door banged open again. For one wild moment,\\r\\nHarry was sure it would be Dumbledore. But it was Lockhart, and\\r\\nhe was beaming.\\r\\n\"So sorry - dozed off - what have I missed?\"\\r\\n251\\r\\nHe didn\\'t seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at him\\r\\nwith something remarkably like hatred. Snape stepped forward.\\r\\n\"Just the man,\" he said. \"The very man. A girl has been snatched by\\r\\nthe monster, Lockhart. Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself. Your\\r\\nmoment has come at last.\"\\r\\nLockhart blanched.\\r\\n\"That\\'s right, Gilderoy,\" chipped in Professor Sprout. \"Weren\\'t you\\r\\nsaying just last night that you\\'ve known all along where the entrance to\\r\\nthe Chamber of Secrets is?\"\\r\\n\"I - well, I -\"sputtered Lockhart.\\r\\n\"Yes, didn\\'t you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?\"\\r\\npiped up Professor Flitwick.\\r\\n\"D-did I? I don\\'t recall -\"\\r\\n\"I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn\\'t had a\\r\\ncrack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested,\" said Snape. \"Didn\\'t\\r\\nyou say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should\\r\\nhave been given a free rein from the first?\"\\r\\nLockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues.\\r\\n\"I - I really never - you may have misunderstood -\"\\r\\n\"We\\'ll leave it to you, then, Gilderoy,\" said Professor McGonagall.\\r\\n\"Tonight will be an excellent time to do it. We\\'ll make sure everyone\\'s\\r\\nout of your way. You\\'ll be able to tackle the monster all by youself. A\\r\\nfree rein at last.\"\\r\\nLockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody came to the\\r\\nrescue. He didn\\'t look remotely handsome anymore. His lip was\\r\\ntrembling, and in the absence of his usually toothy grin, he looked\\r\\nweak-chinned and feeble.\\r\\n\"V very well,\" he said. \"I\\'ll - I\\'ll be in my office, getting getting ready.\"\\r\\nAnd he left the room.\\r\\n252\\r\\n\"Right,\" said Professor McGonagall, whose nostrils were flared,\\r\\n\"that\\'s got him out from under our feet. The Heads of Houses should\\r\\ngo and inform their students what has happened. Tell them the\\r\\nHogwarts Express will take them home first thing tomorrow. Will the\\r\\nrest of you please make sure no students have been left outside their\\r\\ndormitories.\"\\r\\nThe teachers rose and left, one by one.\\r\\nIt was probably the worst day of Harry\\'s entire life. He, Ron, Fred,\\r\\nand George sat together in a corner of the Gryffindor common room,\\r\\nunable to say anything to each other. Percy wasn\\'t there. He had gone\\r\\nto send an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut himself up in his\\r\\ndormitory.\\r\\nNo afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had Gryffindor\\r\\nTower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. Near sunset, Fred and\\r\\nGeorge went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer.\\r\\n\"She knew something, Harry,\" said Ron, speaking for the first time\\r\\nsince they had entered the wardrobe in the staff room. \"That\\'s why\\r\\nshe was taken. It wasn\\'t some stupid thing about Percy at all., She\\'d\\r\\nfound out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That must be why\\r\\nshe was -\" Ron rubbed his eyes frantically. \"I mean, she was a pureblood.\\r\\nThere can\\'t be any other reason.\"\\r\\nHarry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline. This was\\r\\nthe worst he had ever felt. If only there was something they could do.\\r\\nAnything.\\r\\n\"Harry\" said Ron. \"D\\'you think there\\'s any chance at all she\\'s not - you\\r\\nknow =\"\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t know what to say. He couldn\\'t see how Ginny could still\\r\\nbe alive.\\r\\n\"D\\'you know what?\" said Ron. \"I think we should go and see\\r\\n*295*\\r\\n253\\r\\nLockhart. Tell him what we know. He\\'s going to try and get into the\\r\\nChamber. We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it\\'s a\\r\\nbasilisk in there.\"\\r\\nBecause Harry couldn\\'t think of anything else to do, and because he\\r\\nwanted to be doing something, he agreed. The Gryffindors around\\r\\nthem were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that\\r\\nnobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and left\\r\\nthrough the portrait hole.\\r\\nDarkness was falling as they walked down to Lockhart\\'s office.\\r\\nThere seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it. They could hear\\r\\nscraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps.\\r\\nHarry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. Then the\\r\\ndoor opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of Lockhart\\'s eyes\\r\\npeering through it.\\r\\n\"Oh - Mr. Potter - Mr. Weasley -\" he said, opening the door a bit\\r\\nwider. \"I\\'m rather busy at the moment - if you would be quick -\"\\r\\n\"Professor, we\\'ve got some information for you,\" said Harry. \"We\\r\\nthink it\\'ll help you.\"\\r\\n\"Er - well - it\\'s not terribly -\" The side of Lockhart\\'s face that they\\r\\ncould see looked very uncomfortable. \"I mean - well all right -\"\\r\\nHe opened the door and they entered.\\r\\nHis office had been almost completely stripped. Two large trunks\\r\\nstood open on the floor. Robes, jade-green, lilac, midnightblue, had\\r\\nbeen hastily folded into one of them; books were jumbled untidily into\\r\\nthe other. The photographs that had covered the walls were now\\r\\ncrammed into boxes on the desk.\\r\\n*296*\\r\\n\"Are you going somewhere?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"Er, well, yes,\" said Lockhart, ripping a life-size poster of himself from\\r\\nthe back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up. \"Urgent call -\\r\\nunavoidable - got to go -\"\\r\\n254\\r\\n\"What about my sister?\" said Ron jerkily.\\r\\n\"Well, as to that - most unfortunate -\" said Lockhart, avoiding their\\r\\neyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying the contents\\r\\ninto a bag. \"No one regrets more than I -\"\\r\\n\"You\\'re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"You can\\'t go now! Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!\"\\r\\n\"Well - I must say - when I took the job -\" Lockhart muttered, now\\r\\npiling socks on top of his robes. \"nothing in the job description - didn\\'t\\r\\nexpect -\"\\r\\n\"You mean you\\'re running away?\" said Harry disbelievingly. \"After all\\r\\nthat stuff you did in your books -\"\\r\\n\"Books can be misleading,\" said Lockhart delicately.\\r\\n\"You wrote them!\" Harry shouted.\\r\\n\"My dear boy,\" said Lockhart, straightening up and frowning at Harry.\\r\\n\"Do use your common sense. My books wouldn\\'t have sold half as\\r\\nwell if people didn\\'t think Id done all those things. No one wants to\\r\\nread about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a\\r\\nvillage from werewolves. He\\'d look dreadful on the front cover. No\\r\\ndress sense at all. And the witch who banished the Bandon Banshee\\r\\nhad a harelip. I mean, come on -\"\\r\\n\"So you\\'ve just been taking credit for what a load of other people have\\r\\ndone?\" said Harry incredulously.\\r\\n\"Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, shaking his head impatiently, \"it\\'s not\\r\\nnearly as simple as that. There was work involved. I had\\r\\n*297*\\r\\nto track these people down. Ask them exactly how they managed to\\r\\ndo what they did. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so they\\r\\nwouldn\\'t remember doing it. If there\\'s one thing I pride myself on, it\\'s\\r\\nmy Memory Charms. No, it\\'s been a lot of work, Harry. It\\'s not all\\r\\nbook signings and publicity photos, you know. You want fame, you\\r\\n255\\r\\nhave to be prepared for a long hard slog.\"\\r\\nHe banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them.\\r\\n\"Let\\'s see,\" he said. \"I think that\\'s everything. Yes. Only one thing\\r\\nleft.\"\\r\\nHe pulled out his wand and turned to them.\\r\\n\"Awfully sorry, boys, but I\\'ll have to put a Memory Charm on you\\r\\nnow. Can\\'t have you blabbing my secrets all over the place. Id never\\r\\nsell another book -\"\\r\\nHarry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised his,\\r\\nwhen Harry bellowed, \"Expelliarmus!\"\\r\\nLockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand flew\\r\\nhigh into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.\\r\\n\"Shouldn\\'t have let Professor Snape teach us that one,\" said Harry\\r\\nfuriously, kicking Lockhart\\'s trunk aside. Lockhart was looking up at\\r\\nhim, feeble once more. Harry was still pointing his wand at him.\\r\\n\"What d\\'you want me to do?\" said Lockhart weakly. \"I don\\'t know\\r\\nwhere the Chamber of Secrets is. There\\'s nothing I can do.\"\\r\\n\"You\\'re in luck,\" said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint.\\r\\n\"We think we know where it is. And what\\'s inside it. Let\\'s go.\"\\r\\n*298*\\r\\nThey marched Lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairs,\\r\\nalong the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall, to the\\r\\ndoor of Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom.\\r\\nThey sent Lockhart in first. Harry was pleased to see that he was\\r\\nshaking.\\r\\nMoaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet.\\r\\n\"Oh, it\\'s you,\" she said when she saw Harry. \"What do you want this\\r\\ntime?\"\\r\\n256\\r\\n\"To ask you how you died,\" said Harry.\\r\\nMyrtle\\'s whole aspect changed at once. She looked as though she had\\r\\nnever been asked such a flattering question.\\r\\n\"Ooooh, it was dreadful,\" she said with relish. \"It happened right in\\r\\nhere. I died in this very stall. I remember it so well. Id hidden because\\r\\nOlive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. The door was locked,\\r\\nand I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. They said\\r\\nsomething funny. A different language, I think it must have been.\\r\\nAnyway, what really got me was that it was a boy speaking. So I\\r\\nunlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own toilet, and then -\"\\r\\nMyrtle swelled importantly, her face shining. \"I died.\"\\r\\n\"How?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"No idea,\" said Myrtle in hushed tones. \"I just remember seeing a pair\\r\\nof great, big, yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up, and then I\\r\\nwas floating away . . . .\" She looked dreamily at Harry. \"And then I\\r\\ncame back again. I was determined to haunt Olive Hornby, you see.\\r\\nOh, she was sorry she\\'d ever laughed at my glasses.\"\\r\\n\"Where exactly did you see the eyes?\" said Harry.\\r\\n*299*\\r\\n\"Somewhere there,\" said Myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the sink in\\r\\nfront of her toilet.\\r\\nHarry and Ron hurried over to it. Lockhart was standing well back, a\\r\\nlook of utter terror on his face.\\r\\nIt looked like an ordinary sink. They examined every inch of it, inside\\r\\nand out, including the pipes below. And then Harry saw it: Scratched\\r\\non the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake.\\r\\n\"That tap\\'s never worked,\" said Myrtle brightly as he tried to turn it.\\r\\n\"Harry,\" said Ron. \"Say something. Something in Parseltongue.\"\\r\\n\"But -\" Harry thought hard. The only times he\\'d ever managed to\\r\\n257\\r\\nspeak Parseltongue were when he\\'d been faced with a real snake. He\\r\\nstared hard at the tiny- engraving, trying to imagine it was real.\\r\\n\"Open up,\" he said.\\r\\nHe looked at Ron, who shook his head.\\r\\n\"English,\" he said.\\r\\nHarry looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was alive.\\r\\nIf he moved his head, the candlelight made it look as though it were\\r\\nmoving.\\r\\n\"Open up,\" he said.\\r\\nExcept that the words weren\\'t what he heard; a strange hissing had\\r\\nescaped him, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and\\r\\nbegan to spin. Next second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact,\\r\\nsank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wide\\r\\nenough for a man to slide into.\\r\\nHarry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had made up his mind\\r\\nwhat he was going to do.\\r\\n*300*\\r\\n\"I\\'m going down there,\" he said. .\\r\\nHe couldn\\'t not go, not now they had found the entrance to the\\r\\nChamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance\\r\\nthat Ginny might be alive.\\r\\n\"Me too,\" said Ron.\\r\\nThere was a pause.\\r\\n\"Well, you hardly seem to need me,\" said Lockhart, with a shadow\\r\\nof his old smile. \"I\\'ll just -\"\\r\\nHe put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed\\r\\ntheir wands at him.\\r\\n258\\r\\n\"You can go first,\" Ron snarled.\\r\\nWhite-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening.\\r\\n\"Boys,\" he said, his voice feeble. \"Boys, what good will it do?\"\\r\\nHarry jabbed him in the back with his wand. Lockhart slid his legs\\r\\ninto the pipe.\\r\\n\"I really don\\'t think -\" he started to say, but Ron gave him a push,\\r\\nand he slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lowered himself\\r\\nslowly into the pipe, then let go.\\r\\nIt was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could see\\r\\nmore pipes branching off in all directions, but none as large as theirs,\\r\\nwhich twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knew\\r\\nthat he was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeons.\\r\\nBehind him he could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the curves.\\r\\nAnd then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen\\r\\nwhen he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the\\r\\nend with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel\\r\\nlarge enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his\\r\\n*301\\r\\nfeet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harry\\r\\nstood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too.\\r\\n\"We must be miles under the school,\" said Harry, his voice echoing in\\r\\nthe black tunnel.\\r\\n\"Under the lake, probably,\" said Ron, squinting around at the dark,\\r\\nslimy walls.\\r\\nAll three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead.\\r\\n\"Lumos!\" Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. \"C\\'mon,\" he\\r\\nsaid to Ron and Lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slapping\\r\\nloudly on the wet floor.\\r\\nThe tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead.\\r\\n259\\r\\nTheir shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight.\\r\\n\"Remember,\" Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward,\\r\\n\"any sign of movement, close your eyes right away . .....\\r\\nBut the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound\\r\\nthey heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be\\r\\na rat\\'s skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that\\r\\nit was littered with small animal bones. Trying very hard not to\\r\\nimagine what Ginny might look like if they found her, Harry led the\\r\\nway forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel.\\r\\n\"Harry - there\\'s something up there -\" said Ron hoarsely, grabbing\\r\\nHarry\\'s shoulder.\\r\\nThey froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of something\\r\\nhuge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn\\'t moving.\\r\\n\"Maybe it\\'s asleep,\" he breathed, glancing back at the other two.\\r\\nLockhart\\'s hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back to\\r\\nlook at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt.\\r\\n* 302 *\\r\\nVery slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see,\\r\\nHarry edged forward, his wand held high.\\r\\nThe light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green,\\r\\nlying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. The creature that had\\r\\nshed it must have been twenty feet long at least.\\r\\n\"Blimey,\" said Ron weakly.\\r\\nThere was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s\\r\\nknees had given way.\\r\\n\"Get up,\" said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart.\\r\\nLockhart got to his feet - then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the\\r\\nground.\\r\\nHarry jumped forward, but too late - Lockhart was straightening up,\\r\\n260\\r\\npanting, Ron\\'s wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\"The adventure ends here, boys!\" he said. \"I shall take a bit of this\\r\\nskin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl,\\r\\nand that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her\\r\\nmangled body - say good-bye to your memories!\"\\r\\nHe raised Ron\\'s Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled,\\r\\n\"Obliviate!\"\\r\\nThe wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung his\\r\\narms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out\\r\\nof the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to\\r\\nthe floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall\\r\\nof broken rock.\\r\\n\"Ron!\" he shouted. \"Are you okay? Ron!\"\\r\\n\"I\\'m here!\" came Ron\\'s muffled voice from behind the rockfall. \"I\\'m\\r\\nokay - this git\\'s not, though - he got blasted by the wand =\\'\\r\\n*303*\\r\\nThere was a dull thud and a loud \"ow!\" It sounded as though Ron had\\r\\njust kicked Lockhart in the shins.\\r\\n\"What now?\" Ron\\'s voice said, sounding desperate. \"We can\\'t get\\r\\nthrough - it\\'ll take ages ......\\r\\nHarry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it.\\r\\nHe had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by\\r\\nmagic, and now didn\\'t seem a good moment to try - what if the whole\\r\\ntunnel caved in?\\r\\nThere was another thud and another \"ow!\" from behind the rocks.\\r\\nThey were wasting time. Ginny had already been in the Chamber of\\r\\nSecrets for hours .... Harry knew there was only one thing to do.\\r\\n\"Wait there,\" he called to Ron. \"Wait with Lockhart. I\\'ll go on.... If I\\'m\\r\\nnot back in an hour. . .\\r\\n261\\r\\nThere was a very pregnant pause,\\r\\n\"I\\'ll try and shift some of this rock,\" said Ron, who seemed to be trying\\r\\nto keep his voice steady. \"So you can - can get back through. And,\\r\\nHarry -\"\\r\\n\"See you in a bit,\" said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his\\r\\nshaking voice.\\r\\nAnd he set off alone past the giant snake skin.\\r\\nSoon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone.\\r\\nThe tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry\\'s body was\\r\\ntingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded what\\r\\nhe\\'d find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept around yet another\\r\\nbend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were\\r\\ncarved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.\\r\\n*304*\\r\\nHarry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to pretend\\r\\nthese stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely alive.\\r\\nHe could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and the\\r\\nemerald eyes seemed to flicker.\\r\\n\"Open, \"said Harry, in a low, faint hiss.\\r\\nThe serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly\\r\\nout of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside.\\r\\ne was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber. Towering\\r\\nstone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a\\r\\nceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd,\\r\\ngreenish gloom that filled the place.\\r\\nHis heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence.\\r\\nCould the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And\\r\\nwhere was Ginny?\\r\\nHe pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine\\r\\ncolumns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls.\\r\\n262\\r\\nHe kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest\\r\\nsign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes\\r\\nseemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of the\\r\\nstomach, he thought he saw one stir.\\r\\nThen, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the\\r\\nChamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall.\\r\\n*306*\\r\\nHarry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It\\r\\nwas ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to\\r\\nthe bottom of the wizard\\'s sweeping stone robes, where two\\r\\nenormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between\\r\\nthe feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red\\r\\nhair.\\r\\n\"tinny!\" Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees.\\r\\n\"tinny - don\\'t be dead - please don\\'t be dead -\" He flung his wand\\r\\naside, grabbed Ginny\\'s shoulders, and turned her over. Her face was\\r\\nwhite as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn\\'t\\r\\nPetrified. But then she must be\\r\\n\"Ginny, please wake up,\" Harry muttered desperately, shaking her.\\r\\nGinny\\'s head lolled hopelessly from side to side.\\r\\n\"She won\\'t wake,\" said a soft voice.\\r\\nHarry jumped and spun around on his knees.\\r\\nA tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar,\\r\\nwatching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though\\r\\nHarry were looking at him through a misted window. But there was\\r\\nno mistaking him\\r\\n\"Tom - Tom Riddle?\"\\r\\nRiddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry\\'s face.\\r\\n\"What d\\'you mean, she won\\'t wake?\" Harry said desperately. \"She\\'s\\r\\n263\\r\\nnot - she\\'s not -?\"\\r\\n\"She\\'s still alive,\" said Riddle. \"But only just.\"\\r\\nHarry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years\\r\\nago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day\\r\\nolder than sixteen.\\r\\n\"Are you a ghost?\" Harry said uncertainly.\\r\\n* 30 7*\\r\\n\"A memory,\" said Riddle quietly. \"Preserved in a diary for fifty years.\\r\\nHe pointed toward the floor near the statue\\'s giant toes. Lying open\\r\\nthere was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle\\'s\\r\\nbathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there - but\\r\\nthere were more pressing matters to deal with.\\r\\n\"You\\'ve got to help me, Tom,\" Harry said, raising Ginny\\'s head again.\\r\\n\"We\\'ve got to get her out of here. There\\'s a basilisk ... I don\\'t know\\r\\nwhere it is, but it could be along any moment .... Please, help me -1)\\r\\nRiddle didn\\'t move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny half off\\r\\nthe floor, and bent to pick up his wand again.\\r\\nBut his wand had gone.\\r\\n\"Did you see -?\"\\r\\nHe looked up. Riddle was still watching him - twirling Harry\\'s wand\\r\\nbetween his long fingers.\\r\\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, stretching out his hand for it.\\r\\nA smile curled the corners of Riddle\\'s mouth. He continued to stare at\\r\\nHarry, twirling the wand idly.\\r\\n\"Listen,\" said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny\\'s dead\\r\\nweight. \"We\\'ve got to go! If the basilisk comes -\"\\r\\n\"It won\\'t come until it is called,\" said Riddle calmly.\\r\\n264\\r\\nHarry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any\\r\\nlonger.\\r\\n\"What d\\'you mean?\" he said. \"Look, give me my wand, I might need it\\r\\n-\"\\r\\nRiddle\\'s smile broadened.\\r\\n\"You won\\'t be needing it,\" he said.\\r\\n*%08*\\r\\nHarry stared at him.\\r\\n\"What d\\'you mean, I won\\'t be -?\"\\r\\n\"I\\'ve waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle. \"For the\\r\\nchance to see you. To speak to you.\"\\r\\n\"Look,\" said Harry, losing patience, \"I don\\'t think you get it. We\\'re in\\r\\nthe Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later -\"\\r\\n\"We\\'re going to talk now,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he\\r\\npocketed Harry\\'s wand.\\r\\nHarry stared at him. There was something very funny going on here\\r\\n....\\r\\n\"How did Ginny get like this?\" he asked slowly.\\r\\n\"Well, that\\'s an interesting question,\" said Riddle pleasantly. \"And quite\\r\\na long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley\\'s like this is\\r\\nbecause she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible\\r\\nstranger.\"\\r\\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Harry.\\r\\n\"The diary,\" said Riddle. `My diary. Little Ginny\\'s been writing in it for\\r\\nmonths and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - how\\r\\nher brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with\\r\\nsecondhand robes and books, how\" -Riddle\\'s eyes glinted \"how she\\r\\n265\\r\\ndidn\\'t think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her . . . .\"\\r\\nAll the time he spoke, Riddle\\'s eyes never left Harry\\'s face. There\\r\\nwas an almost hungry look in them.\\r\\n\"It\\'s very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an elevenyear-\\r\\nold girl,\" he went on. \"But I was patient. I wrote back. I was\\r\\nsympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one\\'s ever\\r\\nunderstood me like you, Tom .... I\\'m so glad I\\'ve got this diary to\\r\\n*309*\\r\\nconfide in .... It\\'s like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket . . . .\\r\\nRiddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn\\'t suit him. It made the hairs\\r\\nstand up on the back of Harry\\'s neck.\\r\\n\"If I say it myself, Harry, I\\'ve always been able to charm the people I\\r\\nneeded. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to\\r\\nbe exactly what I wanted .... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of\\r\\nher deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more\\r\\npowerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding\\r\\nMiss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul\\r\\nback into her. . .\"\\r\\n\"What d\\'you mean?\" said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry.\\r\\n\" Haven\\'t you guessed yet, Harry Potter?\" said Riddle softly. \"Ginny\\r\\nWeasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school\\r\\nroosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the\\r\\nSerpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib\\'s cat.\\r\\n\"No,\" Harry whispered.\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Riddle, calmly. \"Of course, she didn\\'t know what she was\\r\\ndoing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her\\r\\nnew diary entries ... far more interesting, they became .... Dear Tom,\"\\r\\nhe recited, watching Harry\\'s horrified face, `I think I\\'m losing my\\r\\nmemory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 don\\'t know how\\r\\nthey got there. Dear Tom, l can\\'t remember what 1 did on the night of\\r\\nHalloween, but a cat was attacked and I\\'ve got paint all down my front.\\r\\nDear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I\\'m pale and I\\'m not myself. I think he\\r\\n266\\r\\nsuspects me... There was another attack today\\r\\n*310\\r\\nand I don\\'t know where I was. Tom, what am I going to do? I think I\\'m\\r\\ngoing mad... I think I\\'m the one attacking everyone, Tom!\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his Palms.\\r\\n\"it took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her\\r\\ndiary,\" said Riddle. \"But she finally became suspicious and tried to\\r\\ndispose of it. And that\\'s where you came in, Harry. You found it, and I\\r\\ncouldn\\'t have been more delighted. Of all the people who could have\\r\\npicked it up, it was you, the very person I was most anxious to meet . .\\r\\n. .\"\\r\\n\"And why did you want to meet me?\" said Harry. Anger was coursing\\r\\nthrough him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady.\\r\\n\"Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,\" said Riddle. \"Your\\r\\nwhole fascinating history. \" His eyes roved over the lightning scar on\\r\\nHarry\\'s forehead, and their expression grew hungrier. \"I knew I must\\r\\nfind out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided\\r\\nto show you my famous capture of that great oaf, Hagrid, to gain your\\r\\ntrust -\"\\r\\n\"Hagrid\\'s my friend,\" said Harry, his voice now shaking. \"And you\\r\\nframed him, didn\\'t you? I thought you made a mistake, but -\"\\r\\nRiddle laughed his high laugh again.\\r\\n\"It was my word against Hagrid\\'s, Harry. Well, you can imagine how\\r\\nit looked to old Armando Dippet. On the one hand, Tom Riddle, poor\\r\\nbut brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student ...\\r\\non the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in trouble every other week,\\r\\ntrying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to the\\r\\nForbidden Forest to wrestle trolls ... but I\\r\\n* 31:L *\\r\\nadmit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked. I thought\\r\\nsomeone must realize that Hagrid couldn\\'t possibly be the Heir of\\r\\n267\\r\\nSlytherin. It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I\\r\\ncould about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance\\r\\n... as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power!\\r\\n\"Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think\\r\\nHagrid was innocent. He persuaded Dipper to keep Hagrid and train\\r\\nhim as gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed ....\\r\\nDumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers\\r\\ndid ......\\r\\n\"I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,\" said Harry, his teeth gritted.\\r\\n\"Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid\\r\\nwas expelled,\" said Riddle carelessly. \"I knew it wouldn\\'t be safe to\\r\\nopen the Chamber again while I was still at school. But I wasn\\'t going\\r\\nto waste those long years Id spent searching for it. I decided to leave\\r\\nbehind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that\\r\\none day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and\\r\\nfinish Salazar Slytherin\\'s noble work.\"\\r\\n\"Well, you haven\\'t finished it,\" said Harry triumphantly. \"No one\\'s died\\r\\nthis time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will\\r\\nbe ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again -\"\\r\\n\"Haven\\'t I already told you,\" said Riddle quietly, \"that killing Mudbloods\\r\\ndoesn\\'t matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new target\\r\\nhas been -you.\"\\r\\nHarry stared at him.\\r\\n\"Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was\\r\\n*312*\\r\\nopened, it was Ginny who was writing to me, not you. She saw you\\r\\nwith the diary, you see, and panicked. \"What if you found out how to\\r\\nwork it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I\\r\\ntold you who\\'d been strangling roosters? So the foolish little brat waited\\r\\nuntil your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. But I knew what I\\r\\nmust do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin\\'s\\r\\nheir. From everything Ginny had told me about you, I knew you would\\r\\ngo to any lengths to solve the mystery --\\r\\n268\\r\\nparticularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ginny had\\r\\ntold me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak\\r\\nParseltongue ....\\r\\n\"So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down\\r\\nhere to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring. But\\r\\nthere isn\\'t much life left in her .... She put too much into the diary, into\\r\\nme. Enough to let me leave its pages at last .... I have been waiting for\\r\\nyou to appear since we arrived here. I knew you\\'d come. I have many\\r\\nquestions for you, Harry Potter.\"\\r\\n\"Like what?\" Harry spat, fists still clenched.\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, \"how is it that you a skinny boy\\r\\nwith no extraordinary magical talent - managed to defeat the greatest\\r\\nwizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while\\r\\nLord Voldemort\\'s powers were destroyed?\"\\r\\nThere was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.\\r\\n\"Why do you care how I escaped?\" said Harry slowly. \"Voldemort was\\r\\nafter your time ......\\r\\n\"Voldemort,\" said Riddle softly, \"is my past, present, and future, Harry\\r\\nPotter . . . .\"\\r\\nHe pulled Harry\\'s wand from his pocket and began to trace it\\r\\nthrough the air, writing three shimmering words:\\r\\nTOM MARVOLO RIDDLE\\r\\nThen he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name\\r\\nrearranged themselves:\\r\\nI AM LORD VOLDEMORT\\r\\n\"You see?\" he whispered. \"It was a name I was already using at\\r\\nHogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I\\r\\nwas going to use my filthy Muggle father\\'s name forever? I, in whose\\r\\nveins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my\\r\\nmother\\'s side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who\\r\\n269\\r\\nabandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his\\r\\nwife was a witch? No, Harry - I fashioned myself a new name, a\\r\\nname I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,\\r\\nwhen I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!\"\\r\\nHarry\\'s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle,\\r\\nat the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry\\'s own\\r\\nparents, and so many others .... At last he forced himself to -,peak.\\r\\n\"You\\'re not,\" he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.\\r\\n\"Not what?\" snapped Riddle.\\r\\n\"Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,\" said Harry, breathing fast.\\r\\n\"Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the\\r\\nworld is Albus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you were\\r\\nstrong, you didn\\'t dare try and take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledore\\r\\nsaw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you\\r\\nnow, wherever you\\'re hiding these days -\"\\r\\nThe smile had gone from Riddle\\'s face, to be replaced by a very ugly\\r\\nlook.\\r\\n*31-4*\\r\\n\"Dumbledore\\'s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of\\r\\nme!\" he hissed.\\r\\n\"He\\'s not as gone as you might think!\" Harry retorted. He was\\r\\nspeaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, wishing rather than\\r\\nbelieving it to be true\\r\\nRiddle opened his mouth, but froze.\\r\\nMusic was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled around to stare\\r\\ndown the empty Chamber. The music was growing louder. It was\\r\\neerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry\\'s scalp and\\r\\nmade his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size.\\r\\nThen, as the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibrating\\r\\ninside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar.\\r\\nA crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music\\r\\n270\\r\\nto the vaulted ceiling. It had a glittering golden tail as long as a\\r\\npeacock\\'s and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged\\r\\nbundle.\\r\\nA second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It dropped the\\r\\nragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on his\\r\\nshoulder. As it folded its great wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a\\r\\nlong, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye.\\r\\nThe bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to Harry\\'s cheek,\\r\\ngazing steadily at Riddle.\\r\\n\"That\\'s a phoenix said Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it.\\r\\n\"Fawkes?\" Harry breathed, and he felt the bird\\'s golden claws\\r\\nsqueeze his shoulder gently\\r\\n\"And that -\" said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had\\r\\ndropped, \"that\\'s the old school Sorting Hat -\"\\r\\nSo it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry\\'s\\r\\nfeet.\\r\\nRiddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark\\r\\nchamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at once\\r\\n\"This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old\\r\\nhat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?\"\\r\\nHarry didn\\'t answer. He might not see what use Fawkes or the\\r\\nSorting Hat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited for\\r\\nRiddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting.\\r\\n\"To business, Harry,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly. \"Twice - in your\\r\\npast, in my future - we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How\\r\\ndid you survive? Tell me everything. The longer you talk,\" he added\\r\\nsoftly, \"the longer you stay alive.\"\\r\\nHarry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle had the wand.\\r\\nHe, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would\\r\\nbe much good in a duel. It looked bad, all right ... but the longer Riddle\\r\\nstood there, the more life was dwindling out of Ginny ... and in the\\r\\n271\\r\\nmeantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle\\'s outline was becoming\\r\\nclearer, more solid .... If it had to be a fight between him and Riddle,\\r\\nbetter sooner than later.\\r\\n\"No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,\"\\r\\nsaid Harry abruptly. \"I don\\'t know myself But I know why you\\r\\ncouldn\\'t kill me. Because my mother died to save me. My common\\r\\nMuggle-born mother,\" he added, shaking with suppressed rage. \"She\\r\\nstopped you killing me. And I\\'ve seen the real you, I saw you last\\r\\nyear. You\\'re a wreck. You\\'re barely alive. That\\'s where all your\\r\\npower got you. You\\'re in hiding. You\\'re ugly, you\\'re foul -\"\\r\\n*%16*\\r\\nRiddle\\'s face contorted. Then he forced it into an awful smile. \"So.\\r\\nYour mother died to save you. Yes, that\\'s a powerful countercharm. I\\r\\ncan see now ... there is nothing special about you, after all. I\\r\\nwondered, you see. There are strange likenesses between us, after all.\\r\\nEven you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by\\r\\nMuggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts\\r\\nsince the great Slytherin himself We even look something alike ... but\\r\\nafter all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me. That\\'s\\r\\nall I wanted to know.\"\\r\\nHarry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand. But Riddle\\'s\\r\\ntwisted smile was widening again.\\r\\n\"Now, Harry, I\\'m going to teach you a little lesson. Let\\'s match the\\r\\npowers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against famous\\r\\nHarry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him . . . .\"\\r\\nHe cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then walked\\r\\naway. Harry, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched Ridthe stop\\r\\nbetween the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin,\\r\\nhigh above him in the half-darkness. Riddle opened his mouth wide and\\r\\nhissed - but Harry understood what he was saying ....\\r\\n\"Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four. \"\\r\\nHarry wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on his\\r\\nshoulder.\\r\\n272\\r\\nSlytherin\\'s gigantic stone face was moving. Horrorstruck, Harry saw\\r\\nhis mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole.\\r\\nAnd something was stirring inside the statue\\'s mouth. Something\\r\\nwas slithering up from its depths. 3 1\\r\\nHarry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shut\\r\\nhis eyes tight he felt Fawkes\\' wing sweep his cheek as he took flight.\\r\\nHarry wanted to shout, \"Don\\'t leave me!\" but what chance did a\\r\\nphoenix have against the king of serpents?\\r\\nSomething huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt it\\r\\nshudder - he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could\\r\\nalmost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin\\'s mouth.\\r\\nThen he heard Riddle\\'s hissing voice:\\r\\n\"Kill him. \"\\r\\nThe basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy body\\r\\nslithering heavily across the dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry\\r\\nbegan to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way -\\r\\nVoldemort was laughing\\r\\nHarry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent\\r\\nwas barely feet from him, he could hear it coming\\r\\nThere was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then\\r\\nsomething heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall.\\r\\nWaiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing,\\r\\nsomething thrashing wildly off the pillars\\r\\nHe couldn\\'t help it - he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what\\r\\nwas going on.\\r\\nThe enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk,\\r\\nhad raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving\\r\\ndrunkenly between the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close his\\r\\neyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake.\\r\\nFawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping\\r\\nfuriously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers\\r\\n273\\r\\nFawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight and a\\r\\n*318*\\r\\nsudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor. The snake\\'s tail\\r\\nthrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut his\\r\\neyes, it turned - Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its\\r\\neyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the\\r\\nphoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting\\r\\nin agony.\\r\\n\"NO!\" Harry heard Riddle screaming. \"LEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE\\r\\nTHE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. YOU CAN STILL SMELL\\r\\nHIM. KILL HIMI\"\\r\\nThe blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. Fawkes was\\r\\ncircling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at its\\r\\nscaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes.\\r\\n\"Help me, help me,\" Harry muttered wildly, \"someone - anyone\\r\\nThe snake\\'s tail whipped across the floor again. Harry ducked.\\r\\nSomething soft hit his face.\\r\\nThe basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry\\'s arms. Harry\\r\\nseized it. It was all he had left, his only chance - he rammed it onto his\\r\\nhead and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk\\'s tail swung\\r\\nover him again.\\r\\nHelp me - help me - Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat.\\r\\nPlease help me\\r\\nThere was no answering voice. Instead, the hat contracted, as though\\r\\nan invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly.\\r\\nSomething very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry\\'s head,\\r\\nalmost knocking him out. Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed\\r\\nthe top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard\\r\\nbeneath it.\\r\\n3 19\\r\\n274\\r\\nA gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle\\r\\nglittering with rubies the size of eggs.\\r\\n\"KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU.\\r\\nSNIFF -- SMELL HIM.\"\\r\\nHarry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk\\'s head was falling, its body\\r\\ncoiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him. He could see the\\r\\nvast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough\\r\\nto swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin,\\r\\nglittering, venomous -\\r\\nIt lunged blindly -- Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. It lunged\\r\\nagain, and its forked tongue lashed Harry\\'s side. He raised the sword\\r\\nin both his hands -\\r\\nThe basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true -- Harry threw\\r\\nhis whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof\\r\\nof the serpent\\'s mouth -\\r\\nBut as warm blood drenched Harry\\'s arms, he felt a searing pain just\\r\\nabove his elbow. One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper and\\r\\ndeeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over\\r\\nsideways and fell, twitching, to the floor.\\r\\nHarry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreading\\r\\npoison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he knew it\\r\\nwas too late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from\\r\\nthe wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood\\r\\nsoaking his robes, his vision went foggy. The Chamber was dissolving\\r\\nin a whirl of dull color.\\r\\nA patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws\\r\\nbeside him.\\r\\n\"Fawkes,\" said Harry thickly. \"You were fantastic, Fawkes . . . .\"\\r\\n1,520\\r\\nHe felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent\\'s\\r\\nfang had pierced him.\\r\\n275\\r\\nHe could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in\\r\\nfront of him.\\r\\n\"You\\'re dead, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle\\'s voice above him. \"Dead.\\r\\nEven Dumbledore\\'s bird knows it. Do you see what he\\'s doing, Potter?\\r\\nHe\\'s crying.\"\\r\\nHarry blinked. Fawke\\'s head slid in and out of focus. Thick, pearly tears\\r\\nwere trickling down the glossy feathers.\\r\\n\"I\\'m going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your time.\\r\\nI\\'m in no hurry.\"\\r\\nHarry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning.\\r\\n\"So ends the famous Harry Potter,\" said Riddle\\'s distant voice. \"Alone\\r\\nin the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by\\r\\nthe Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You\\'ll be back with your dear\\r\\nMudblood mother soon, Harry... She bought you twelve years of\\r\\nborrowed time ... but Lord Voldemort got you in the end, as you knew\\r\\nhe must . . . .\"\\r\\nIf this is dying, thought Harry, it\\'s not so bad.\\r\\nEven the pain was leaving him ....\\r\\nBut was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to be\\r\\ncoming back into focus. Harry gave his head a little shake and there was\\r\\nFawkes, still resting his head on Harry\\'s arm. A pearly patch of tears was\\r\\nshining all around the wound -- except that there was no wound\\r\\n\"Get away, bird,\" said Riddle\\'s voice suddenly. \"Get away from him -\\r\\nI said, get away --\"\\r\\nHarry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry\\'s wand at\\r\\nFawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a\\r\\nwhirl of gold and scarlet.\\r\\n\"Phoenix tears. - .\" said Riddle quietly, staring at Harry\\'s arm. \"Of\\r\\ncourse ... healing powers ... I forgot. . .\"\\r\\n276\\r\\nHe looked into Harry\\'s face. \"But it makes no difference. In fact, I\\r\\nprefer it this way. Just you and me, Harry Potter ... you and me....\\r\\nHe raised the wand\\r\\nThen, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and\\r\\nsomething fell into Harry\\'s lap -- the diary.\\r\\nFor a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it.\\r\\nThen, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to\\r\\ndo it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him\\r\\nand plunged it straight into the heart of the book.\\r\\nThere was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of the\\r\\ndiary in torrents, streaming over Harry\\'s hands, flooding the floor.\\r\\nRiddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then\\r\\nHe had gone. Harry\\'s wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there\\r\\nwas silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing\\r\\nfrom the diary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right\\r\\nthrough it.\\r\\nShaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning as\\r\\nthough he\\'d just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gathered\\r\\ntogether his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved\\r\\nthe glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk\\'s mouth.\\r\\nThen came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. Ginny was\\r\\nstirring. As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up. Her bemused\\r\\n1,522\\r\\neyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in\\r\\nhis blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a great,\\r\\nshuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face.\\r\\n\"Harry -- oh, Harry -- I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn\\'t\\r\\nsay it in front of Percy -- it was me, Harry -- but I -- I s-swear I ddiddt\\r\\nmean to -- R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over -- and - how\\r\\ndid you kill that -- that thing? W-where\\'s Riddle? The last thing I rremember\\r\\nis him coming out of the diary --\"\\r\\n277\\r\\n\" It\\'s all right,\" said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the\\r\\nfang hole, \"Riddle\\'s finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. C\\'mon,\\r\\nGinny, let\\'s get out of here --\"\\r\\n\"I\\'m going to be expelled!\" Ginny wept as Harry helped her\\r\\nawkwardly to her feet. \"I\\'ve looked forward to coming to Hogwarts\\r\\never since B-Bill came and n-now I\\'ll have to leave and -- w-what\\'ll\\r\\nMum and Dad say?\"\\r\\nFawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance.\\r\\nHarry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of\\r\\nthe dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel.\\r\\nHarry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss.\\r\\nAfter a few minutes\\' progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound of\\r\\nslowly shifting rock reached Harry\\'s ears.\\r\\n\"Ron!\" Harry yelled, speeding up. \"Ginny\\'s okay! I\\'ve got her!\"\\r\\nHe heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to\\r\\nsee his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to\\r\\nmake in the rock fall.\\r\\n\"Ginny!\" Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull\\r\\n321,3\\r\\nher through first. \"You\\'re alive! I don\\'t believe it! What happened?\"\\r\\nHow - what -- where did that bird come from?\"\\r\\nFawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny.\\r\\n\"He\\'s Dumbledore\\'s,\" said Harry, squeezing through himself\\r\\n\"How come you\\'ve got a sword?\" said Ron, gaping at the glittering\\r\\nweapon in Harry\\'s hand.\\r\\n\"I\\'ll explain when we get out of here,\" said Harry with a sideways\\r\\nglance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever.\\r\\n\"But --\"\\r\\n278\\r\\n\"Later,\" Harry said shortly. He didn\\'t think it was a good idea to tell\\r\\nRon yet who\\'d been opening the Chamber, not in front of Ginny,\\r\\nanyway. \"Where\\'s Lockhart?\"\\r\\n\"Back there,\" said Ron, still looking puzzled but jerking his head up the\\r\\ntunnel toward the pipe. \"He\\'s in a bad way. Come and see.\"\\r\\nLed by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow\\r\\nin the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe.\\r\\nGilderoy Lockhart was sitting there, humming placidly to himself.\\r\\n\"His memory\\'s gone,\" said Ron. \"The Memory Charm backfired. Hit\\r\\nhim instead of us. Hasn\\'t got a clue who he is, or where he is, or who\\r\\nwe are. I told him to come and wait here. He\\'s a danger to himself\"\\r\\nLockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all.\\r\\n\"Hello,\" he said. \"Odd sort of place, this, isn\\'t it? Do you live here?\"\\r\\n\"No,\" said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry.\\r\\nHarry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe.\\r\\n\"Have you thought how we\\'re going to get back up this?\" he said to\\r\\nRon.\\r\\n*324*\\r\\nRon shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harry\\r\\nand was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright in the\\r\\ndark. He was waving his long golden tail feathers. Harry looked\\r\\nuncertainly at him.\\r\\n\"He looks like he wants you to grab hold. . .\" said Ron, looking\\r\\nperplexed. \"But you\\'re much too heavy for a bird to pull up there -\"\\r\\n\"Fawkes,\" said Harry, \"isn\\'t an ordinary bird.\" He turned quickly to the\\r\\nothers. \"We\\'ve got to hold on to each other. Ginny, grab Ron\\'s hand.\\r\\nProfessor Lockhart --\"\\r\\n\"He means you,\" said Ron sharply to Lockhart.\\r\\n279\\r\\n\"You hold Ginny\\'s other hand --\"\\r\\nHarry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron took\\r\\nhold of the back of Harry\\'s robes, and Harry reached out and took\\r\\nhold of Fawkes\\'s strangely hot tail feathers.\\r\\nAn extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole body\\r\\nand the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upward\\r\\nthrough the pipe. Harry could hear Lockhart dangling below him,\\r\\nsaying, \"Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!\" The chill air was\\r\\nwhipping through Harry\\'s hair, and before he\\'d stopped enjoying the\\r\\nride, it was over -- all four of them were hitting the wet floor of\\r\\nMoaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened his hat, the\\r\\nsink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place.\\r\\nMyrtle goggled at them.\\r\\n\"You\\'re alive,\" she said blankly to Harry.\\r\\n\"There\\'s no need to sound so disappointed,\" he said grimly, wiping\\r\\nflecks of blood and slime off his glasses.\\r\\n* 325*\\r\\n\"Oh, well ... Id just been thinking ... if you had died, you\\'d have been\\r\\nwelcome to share my toilet,\" said Myrtle, blushing silver.\\r\\n\"Urgh!\" said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, deserted\\r\\ncorridor outside. \"Harry! I think Myrtle\\'s grown fond of you! You\\'ve\\r\\ngot competition, Ginny!\"\\r\\nBut tears were still flooding silently down Ginny\\'s face.\\r\\n\"Where now?\" said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny. Harry pointed.\\r\\nFawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor. They\\r\\nstrode after him, and moments later, found themselves outside\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall\\'s office.\\r\\nHarry knocked and pushed the door open.\\r\\nG F-I A P T E IR\\r\\n280\\r\\nk\\' I G 14 T V V N\\r\\nDO\\r\\nY\\'$ REWARD\\r\\nor a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart\\r\\nstood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in Harry\\'s case)\\r\\nblood. Then there was a scream.\\r\\n\"Ginny!\"\\r\\nIt was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the fire.\\r\\nShe leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of\\r\\nthem flung themselves on their daughter.\\r\\nHarry, however, was looking past them. Professor Dumbledore was\\r\\nstanding by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor McGonagall,\\r\\nwho was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest. Fawkes\\r\\nwent whooshing past Harry\\'s ear and settled on Dumbledore\\'s\\r\\nshoulder, just as Harry found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs.\\r\\nWeasleys tight embrace.\\r\\n\"You saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?\"\\r\\n\"I think we\\'d all like to know that,\" said Professor McGonagall weakly.\\r\\nMrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a moment, then\\r\\nwalked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the\\r\\nrubyencrusted sword, and what remained of Riddle\\'s diary.\\r\\nThen he started telling them everything. For nearly a quarter of an\\r\\nhour he spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing the\\r\\ndisembodied voice, how Hermione had finally realized that he was\\r\\nhearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed the\\r\\nspiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the last\\r\\nvictim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning\\r\\n281\\r\\nMyrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of\\r\\nSecrets might be in her bathroom ....\\r\\n\"Very well,\" Professor McGonagall prompted him as he paused, \"so\\r\\nyou found out where the entrance was -- breaking a hundred school\\r\\nrules into pieces along the way, I might add - but how on earth did\\r\\nyou all get out of there alive, Potter?\"\\r\\nSo Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told\\r\\nthem about Fawkes\\'s timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving\\r\\nhim the sword. But then he faltered. He had so far avoided\\r\\nmentioning Riddle\\'s diary -- or Ginny. She was standing with her\\r\\nhead against Mrs. Weasley\\'s shoulder, and tears were still coursing\\r\\nsilently down her cheeks. What if they expelled her? Harry thought in\\r\\npanic. Riddle\\'s diary didn\\'t work anymore .... How could they prove\\r\\nit had been he who\\'d made her do it all?\\r\\nInstinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly, the\\r\\nfirelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles.\\r\\n\"\\\\What interests me most,\" said Dumbledore gently, \"is how Lord\\r\\nVoldemort managed to enchant Ginny, when my sources tell me he is\\r\\ncurrently in hiding in the forests of Albania.\"\\r\\n*328*\\r\\nRelief -- warm, sweeping, glorious relief -- swept over Harry. \"Wwhat\\'s\\r\\nthat?\" said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice. \"YouKnow-Who?\\r\\nEn-enchant Ginny? But Ginny\\'s not ... Ginny hasn\\'t been ... has she?\"\\r\\n\"It was this diary,\" said Harry quickly, picking it up and showing it to\\r\\nDumbledore. \"Riddle wrote it when he was sixteen . . . .\"\\r\\nDumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down his\\r\\nlong, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages.\\r\\n\"Brilliant,\" he said softly. \"Of course, he was probably the most\\r\\nbrilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.\" He turned around to the\\r\\nWeasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered.\\r\\n\"Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom\\r\\nRiddle. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He\\r\\n282\\r\\ndisappeared after leaving the school ... traveled far and wide ... sank\\r\\nso deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our\\r\\nkind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that\\r\\nwhen he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable.\\r\\nHardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever,\\r\\nhandsome boy who was once Head Boy here.\"\\r\\n\"But, Ginny,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"What\\'s our Ginny got to do with -\\r\\nwith -- him?\"\\r\\n\"His d-diaryl\" Ginny sobbed. \"I\\'ve b-been writing in it, and he\\'s been\\r\\nw-writing back all year --\"\\r\\n\"tinny!\" said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. \"Haven\\'t I taught you\\r\\nanything. What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can\\r\\nthink for itself if you can\\'t see where it keeps its brain? Why didn\\'t\\r\\nyou show the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious object like\\r\\nthat, it was clearly full of Dark Magic =\\'\\r\\n*329*\\r\\n\"I d-didn\\'t know,\" sobbed Ginny. \"I found it inside one of the books\\r\\nMum got me. I th-thought someone had just left it in there and\\r\\nforgotten about it --\"\\r\\n\"Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,\"\\r\\nDumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. \"This has been a terrible\\r\\nordeal for her. There will be no punishment. Older and wiser wizards\\r\\nthan she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.\" He strode over\\r\\nto the door and opened it. \"Bed rest and perhaps a large, steaming\\r\\nmug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up,\" he added,\\r\\ntwinkling kindly down at her. \"You will find that Madam Pomfrey is\\r\\nstill awake. She\\'s just giving out Mandrake juice -- I daresay the\\r\\nbasilisk\\'s victims will be waking up any moment.\"\\r\\n\"So Hermione\\'s okay!\" said Ron brightly.\\r\\n\"There has been no lasting harm done, Ginny,\" said Dumbledore.\\r\\nMrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley followed, still looking\\r\\ndeeply shaken.\\r\\n283\\r\\n\"You know, Minerva,\" Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully to\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall, \"I think all this merits a good feast. Might I ask\\r\\nyou to go and alert the kitchens?\"\\r\\n\"Right,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door.\\r\\n\"I\\'ll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?\"\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" said Dumbledore.\\r\\nShe left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore. What\\r\\nexactly had Professor McGonagall meant, deal with them? Surely -\\r\\nsurely - they weren\\'t about to be punished?\\r\\n\"I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if\\r\\nyou broke any more school rules, said Dumbledore.\\r\\n*%30*\\r\\nRon opened his mouth in horror.\\r\\n\"Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our\\r\\nwords,\" Dumbledore went on, smiling. \"You will both receive Special\\r\\nAwards for Services to the School and -- let me see - yes, I think two\\r\\nhundred points apiece for Gryffindor.\"\\r\\nRon went as briglitly pink as Lockhart\\'s valentine flowers and closed\\r\\nhis mouth again.\\r\\n\"But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this\\r\\ndangerous adventure,\" Dumbledore added. \"Why so modest,\\r\\nGilderoy?\"\\r\\nHarry gave a start. He had completely forgotten about Lockhart. He\\r\\nturned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room,\\r\\nstill wearing his vague smile. When Dumbledore addressed him,\\r\\nLockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to.\\r\\n\"Professor Dumbledore,\" Ron said quickly, \"there was an accident\\r\\ndown in the Chamber of Secrets. Professor Lockhart --\"\\r\\n\"Am I a professor?\" said Lockhart in mild surprise. \"Goodness. I\\r\\nexpect I was hopeless, was I?\"\\r\\n284\\r\\n\"He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired,\" Ron\\r\\nexplained quietly to Dumbledore.\\r\\n\"Dear me,\" said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silver\\r\\nmustache quivering. \"Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy!\"\\r\\n\"Sword?\" said Lockhart dimly. \"Haven\\'t got a sword. That boy has,\\r\\nthough.\" He pointed at Harry. \"He\\'ll lend you one.\"\\r\\n\"Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infirmary, too?\"\\r\\nDumbledore said to Ron. \"Id like a few more words with Harry .....\\r\\nLockhart ambled out. Ron cast a curious look back at Dumbledore and\\r\\nHarry as he closed the door.\\r\\nDumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire.\\r\\n\"Sit down, Harry,\" he said, and Harry sat, feeling unaccountably\\r\\nnervous.\\r\\n\"First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,\" said Dumbledore, eyes\\r\\ntwinkling again. \"You must have shown me real loyalty down in the\\r\\nChamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.\"\\r\\nHe stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee.\\r\\nHarry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him.\\r\\n\"And so you met Tom Riddle,\" said Dumbledore thoughtfully. \"I\\r\\nimagine he was most interested in you . . . . \"\\r\\nSuddenly, something that was nagging at Harry came tumbling out of\\r\\nhis mouth.\\r\\n\"Professor Dumbledore ... Riddle said I\\'m like him. Strange likenesses,\\r\\nhe said ......\\r\\n\"Did he, now?\" said Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully at Harry from\\r\\nunder his thick silver eyebrows. \"And what do you think, Harry?\"\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think I\\'m like him!\" said Harry, more loudly than he\\'d intended.\\r\\n\"I mean, I\\'m -- I\\'m in Gryffindor, I\\'m . . .\"\\r\\n285\\r\\nBut he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind.\\r\\n\"Professor,\" he started again after a moment. \"The Sorting Hat told me\\r\\nId -- Id have done well in Slytherin. Everyone thought I was Slytherin\\'s\\r\\nheir for a while ... because I can speak Parseltongue ....\\r\\n\"You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,\" said Dumbledore calmly,\\r\\n\"because Lord Voldemort -- who is the last remaining ancestor\\r\\n*$32*\\r\\nof Salazar Slytherin -- can speak Parseltongue. Unless I\\'m much\\r\\nmistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he\\r\\ngave you that scar. Not something he intended to do, I\\'m sure ....\\r\\n\"Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?\" Harry said, thunderstruck.\\r\\n\"It certainly seems so.\"\\r\\n\"So I should be in Slytherin,\" Harry said, looking desperately into\\r\\nDumbledore\\'s face. \"The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin\\'s power in\\r\\nme, and it --\"\\r\\n\"Put you in Gryffindor,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Listen to me, Harry.\\r\\nYou happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his handpicked\\r\\nstudents. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue -\\r\\nresourcefulness - determination -- a certain disregard for rules,\" he\\r\\nadded, his mustache quivering again. \"Yet the Sorting Hat placed you\\r\\nin Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.\"\\r\\n\"It only put me in Gryffindor,\" said Harry in a defeated voice, \"because\\r\\nI asked not to go in Slytherin . . . .\"\\r\\n`Exactly, \"said Dumbledore, beaming once more. \"Which makes you\\r\\nvery different from Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that show what\\r\\nwe truly are, far more than our abilities.\" Harry sat motionless in his\\r\\nchair, stunned. \"If you want proof, Harry, that you belong in\\r\\nGryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.\"\\r\\nDumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall\\'s desk, picked\\r\\nup the blood-stained silver sword, and handed it to Harry. Dully, Harry\\r\\n286\\r\\nturned it over, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And then he saw the\\r\\nname engraved just below the hilt.\\r\\nGodric Gryffindor\\r\\n*333*\\r\\n\"Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry,\"\\r\\nsaid Dumbledore simply.\\r\\nFor a minute, neither of them spoke. Then Dumbledore pulled open\\r\\none of the drawers in Professor McGonagall\\'s desk and took out a quill\\r\\nand a bottle of ink.\\r\\nWhat you need, Harry, is some food and sleep. I suggest you go down\\r\\nto the feast, while I write to Azkaban -- we need our gamekeeper\\r\\nback. And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, too,\" he\\r\\nadded thoughtfully. \"We\\'ll be needing a new Defense Against the\\r\\nDark Arts teacher... Dear me, we do seem to run through them, don\\'t\\r\\nwe?\"\\r\\nHarry got up and crossed to the door. He had just reached for the\\r\\nhandle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bounced\\r\\nback off the wall.\\r\\nLucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his face. And cowering behind his\\r\\nlegs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was Dobby.\\r\\n\"Good evening, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly.\\r\\nMr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept into the room.\\r\\nDobby went scurrying in after him, crouching at the hem of his cloak,\\r\\na look of abject terror on his face.\\r\\nThe elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting to\\r\\nfinish cleaning Mr. Malfoys shoes. Apparently Mr. Malfoy had set out\\r\\nin a great hurry, for not only were his shoes half-polished, but his\\r\\nusually sleek hair was disheveled. Ignoring the elf bobbing\\r\\napologetically around his ankles, he fixed his cold eyes upon\\r\\nDumbledore.\\r\\n\"So!\" he said \"You\\'ve come back. The governors suspended you, but\\r\\n287\\r\\nyou still saw fit to return to Hogwarts.\"\\r\\n*%$4*\\r\\n\"Well, you see, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore, smiling serenely, \"the\\r\\nother eleven governors contacted me today. It was something like\\r\\nbeing caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They\\'d heard that\\r\\nArthur Weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back here\\r\\nat once. They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after\\r\\nall. Very strange tales they told me, too .... Several of them seemed\\r\\nto think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn\\'t\\r\\nagree to suspend me in the first place.\"\\r\\nMr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still slits of\\r\\nfury.\\r\\n\"So -- have you stopped the attacks yet?\" he sneered. \"Have you\\r\\ncaught the culprit?\"\\r\\n\"We have,\" said Dumbledore, with a smile.\\r\\n\"Well?\"said Mr. Malfoy sharply. \"Who is it?\"\\r\\n\"The same person as last time, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore. \"But this\\r\\ntime, Lord Voldemort was acting through somebody else. By means\\r\\nof this diary.\"\\r\\nHe held up the small black book with the large hole through the\\r\\ncenter, watching Mr. Malfoy closely. Harry, however, was watching\\r\\nDobby.\\r\\nThe elf was doing something very odd. His great eyes fixed\\r\\nmeaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the diary, then at Mr.\\r\\nMalfoy, and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist.\\r\\n\"I see. . . \" said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore.\\r\\n\"A clever plan,\" said Dumbledore in a level voice, still staring Mr.\\r\\nMalfoy straight in the eye. \"Because if Harry here\" --Mr. Malfoy shot\\r\\nHarry a swift, sharp look -- \"and his friend Ron hadn\\'t discovered\\r\\nthis book, why -- Ginny Weasley might have taken all\\r\\n288\\r\\n*335*\\r\\nthe blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn\\'t\\r\\nacted of her own free will ......\\r\\nMr. Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly masklike.\\r\\n\"And imagine,\" Dumbledore went on, \"what might have happened\\r\\nthen .... The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-blood\\r\\nfamilies. Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle\\r\\nProtection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and -\\r\\nkilling Muggle-borns .... Very fortunate the diary was discovered,\\r\\nand Riddle\\'s memories wiped from it. \"Who knows what the\\r\\nconsequences might have been otherwise ......\\r\\nMr. Malfoy forced himself to speak.\\r\\n\"Very fortunate,\" he said stiffly.\\r\\nAnd still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first to the diary,\\r\\nthen to Lucius Malfoy, then punching himself in the head.\\r\\nAnd Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at Dobby, and Dobby\\r\\nbacked into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr.\\r\\nMalfoy?\" said Harry.\\r\\nLucius Malfoy rounded on him.\\r\\n\"How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?\" he said.\\r\\n\"Because you gave it to her,\" said Harry. \"In Flourish and Blotts.\\r\\nYou picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary\\r\\ninside it, didn\\'t you?\"\\r\\nHe saw Mr. Malfoy\\'s white hands clench and unclench.\\r\\n\"Prove it,\" he hissed.\\r\\n\"Oh, no one will be able to do that,\" said Dumbledore, smiling at\\r\\nHarry. \"Not now that Riddle has vanished from the book.

Instead,\\r\\nhe turned to his house-elf\\r\\n\"We\\'re going, Dobby!\"\\r\\nHe wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him,\\r\\nhe kicked him right through it. They could hear Dobby squealing with\\r\\npain all the way along the corridor. Harry stood for a moment,\\r\\nthinking hard. Then it came to him -\\r\\n\"Professor Dumbledore,\" he said hurriedly. \"Can I give that diary\\r\\nback to Mr. Malfoy, please?\"\\r\\n\"Certainly, Harry,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"But hurry. The feast,\\r\\nremember ......\\r\\nHarry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office. He could hear\\r\\nDobby\\'s squeals of pain receding around the corner. Quickly,\\r\\nwondering if this plan could possibly work, Harry took off one of his\\r\\nshoes, pulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into it.\\r\\nThen he ran down the dark corridor.\\r\\nHe caught up with them at the top of the stairs.\\r\\n\"Mr. Malfoy,\" he gasped, skidding to a halt, \"I\\'ve got something for\\r\\nyou --\"\\r\\nAnd he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy\\'s hand.\\r\\n\")What the --?\"\\r\\nMr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then looked\\r\\nfuriously from the ruined book to Harry.\\r\\n290\\r\\n*\\',531*\\r\\nYou\\'ll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days,\\r\\nHarry Potter,\" he said softly. \"They were meddlesome fools, too.\\r\\nHe turned to go.\\r\\n\"Come, Dobby. I said, come.\"\\r\\nBut Dobby didn\\'t move. He was holding up Harry\\'s disgusting, slimy\\r\\nsock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure.\\r\\n\"Master has given a sock,\" said the elf in wonderment. \"Master gave\\r\\nit to Dobby.\"\\r\\n\"What\\'s that?\" spat Mr. Malfoy. \"What did you say?\"\\r\\n\"Got a sock,\" said Dobby in disbelief. \"Master threw it, and Dobby\\r\\ncaught it, and Dobby -- Dobby is free. \"\\r\\nLucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf Then he lunged at\\r\\nHarry.\\r\\n\"You\\'ve lost me my servant, boy!\"\\r\\nBut Dobby shouted, \"You shall not harm Harry Potter!\"\\r\\nThere was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He\\r\\ncrashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap\\r\\non the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his\\r\\nwand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.\\r\\n\"You shall go now,\" he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy.\\r\\n\"You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.\"\\r\\nLucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair\\r\\nof them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.\\r\\n\"Harry Potter freed Dobby!\" said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry,\\r\\nmoonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes.\\r\\n\"Harry Potter set Dobby free!\"\\r\\n291\\r\\n\"Least I could do, Dobby,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Just promise never\\r\\nto try and save my life again.\"\\r\\nThe elf\\'s ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve just got one question, Dobby,\" said Harry as Dobby pulled on\\r\\nHarry\\'s sock with shaking hands. \"You told me all this had nothing to\\r\\ndo with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well --\"\\r\\n\"It was a clue, sir,\" said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this was\\r\\nobvious. \"Was giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he changed\\r\\nhis name, could be freely named, you see?\"\\r\\n\"Right,\" said Harry weakly. \"Well, Id better go. There\\'s a feast, and\\r\\nmy friend Hermione should be awake by now .....\\r\\nDobby threw his arms around Harry\\'s middle and hugged him.\\r\\n\"Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!\" he sobbed.\\r\\n\"Farewell, Harry Potter!\"\\r\\nAnd with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared.\\r\\nHarry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like\\r\\nthis. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all\\r\\nnight. Harry didn\\'t know whether the best bit was Hermione running\\r\\ntoward him, screaming \"You solved it! You solved it!\" or Justin\\r\\nhurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring. his hand and\\r\\napologize endlessly for suspecting him, or Hagrid turning up at half\\r\\npast three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they\\r\\nwere knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and Ron\\'s four hundred\\r\\npoints for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year\\r\\nrunning, or Professor McGonagall standing up to\\r\\n*339*\\r\\ntell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat (\"Oh,\\r\\nno!\" said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately,\\r\\nProfessor Lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to the\\r\\nfact that he needed to go away and get his memory back. Quite a few\\r\\nof the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news.\\r\\n292\\r\\n\"Shame,\" said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut. \"He was\\r\\nstarting to grow on me.\"\\r\\nThe rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine.\\r\\nHogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences -\\r\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled (\"but we\\'ve\\r\\nhad plenty of practice at that anyway,\" Ron told a disgruntled\\r\\nHermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school governor.\\r\\nDraco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned\\r\\nthe place. On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. On the other\\r\\nhand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again.\\r\\nToo soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express.\\r\\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to\\r\\nthemselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which they\\r\\nwere allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding\\r\\nSnap, set off the very last of Fred and George\\'s Filibuster fireworks,\\r\\nand practiced disarming each other by magic. Harry was getting very\\r\\ngood at it.\\r\\nThey were almost at King\\'s Cross when Harry remembered\\r\\nsomething.\\r\\n\"Ginny - what did you see Percy doing, that he didn\\'t want you to tell\\r\\nanyone?\"\\r\\n*340*\\r\\n\"Oh, that,\" said Ginny, giggling. \"Well - Percy\\'s got a girlfriend.\" Fred\\r\\ndropped a stack of books on George\\'s head.\\r\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n\"It\\'s that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater,\" said Ginny.\\r\\n\"That\\'s who he was writing to all last summer. He\\'s been meeting her\\r\\nall over the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty\\r\\nclassroom one day. He was so upset when she was -- you know -\\r\\nattacked. You won\\'t tease him, will you?\" she added anxiously.\\r\\n\"Wouldn\\'t dream of it,\" said Fred, who was looking like his birthday\\r\\nhad come early.\\r\\n293\\r\\n\"Definitely not,\" said George, sniggering.\\r\\nThe Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped.\\r\\nHarry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron\\r\\nand Hermione.\\r\\n\"This is called a telephone number,\" he told Ron, scribbling it twice,\\r\\ntearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them. \"I told your dad\\r\\nhow to use a telephone last summer - he\\'ll know. Call me at the\\r\\nDursleys\\', okay? I can\\'t stand another two months with only Dudley\\r\\nto talk to ......\\r\\n\"Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won\\'t they?\" said\\r\\nHermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging\\r\\ntoward the enchanted barrier. \"When they hear what you did this\\r\\nyear?\"\\r\\n\"Proud?\" said Harry. \"Are you crazy? All those times I could\\'ve\\r\\ndied, and I didn\\'t manage it? They\\'ll be furious ......\\r\\nAnd together they walked back through the gateway to the Muggle\\r\\nworld. \\'\\r\\n*341*']\n"
