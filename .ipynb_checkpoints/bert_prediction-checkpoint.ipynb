       " 'Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills. He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.',\n",
       " \"The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years; in fact  Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\",\n",
       " 'When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window.',\n",
       " \"At half past eight  Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.  Little tyke   chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive.\",\n",
       " \"It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar    a cat reading a map. For a second  Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen    then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of. It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive    no  looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\",\n",
       " \"But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes    the getups you saw on young people. He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak. The nerve of him. But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt    these people were obviously collecting for something. yes  that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills.\",\n",
       " \"Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\",\n",
       " \"He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\",\n",
       " \" The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry  Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it.\",\n",
       " \"He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking. no  he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her    if he'd had a sister like that. but all the same  those people in cloaks.\",\n",
       " \"He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\",\n",
       " \" Sorry   he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today. Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last. Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day.  And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\",\n",
       " \"Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was. He was rattled.

Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.  The newscaster allowed himself a grin.  Most mysterious. And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather.

He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered   I should have known. \",\n",

Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs. Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat.

Shooting stars down in Kent    I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.   You can't blame them   said Dumbledore gently.

Harry had a thin face  knobbly knees  black hair  and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning.

Is that all right'' Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly   So I'll have thirty . thirty.   Thirty nine  sweetums   said Aunt Petunia.\",\n",
       " \" Oh.  Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel.  All right then.  Uncle Vernon chuckled.  Little tyke wants his money's worth  just like his father. 'Atta boy  Dudley.  He ruffled Dudley's hair.\",\n",
       " \"At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike  a video camera  a remote control airplane  sixteen new computer games  and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.  Bad news  Vernon   she said.  Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him.  She jerked her head in Harry's direction.\",\n",
       " \"Dudley's mouth fell open in horror  but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday  his parents took him and a friend out for the day  to adventure parks  hamburger restaurants  or the movies. Every year  Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg  a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned.\",\n",
       " \" Now what.  said Aunt Petunia  looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg  but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles  Snowy  Mr. Paws  and Tufty again.  We could phone Marge   Uncle Vernon suggested.  Don't be silly  Vernon  she hates the boy. \",\n",
       " \"The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this  as though he wasn't there    or rather  as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them  like a slug.  What about what's her name  your friend    Yvonne.   On vacation in Majorca   snapped Aunt Petunia.\",\n",
       " \" You could just leave me here   Harry put in hopefully  he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer . Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon.  And come back and find the house in ruins.  she snarled.\",\n",
       " \" I won't blow up the house   said Harry  but they weren't listening.  I suppose we could take him to the zoo   said Aunt Petunia slowly   . and leave him in the car..   That car's new  he's not sitting in it alone.. \",\n",
       " \"Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact  he wasn't really crying    it had been years since he'd really cried    but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed  his mother would give him anything he wanted.  Dinky Duddydums  don't cry  Mummy won't let him spoil your special day.  she cried  flinging her arms around him.\",\n",
       " \" I. don't. want. him. t t to come.  Dudley yelled between huge  pretend sobs.  He always sp  spoils everything.  He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms.\",\n",
       " \"Just then  the doorbell rang     Oh  good Lord  they're here.  said Aunt Petunia frantically    and a moment later  Dudley's best friend  Piers Polkiss  walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\",\n",
       " \"Half an hour later  Harry  who couldn't believe his luck  was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley  on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him  but before they'd left  Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\",\n",

       " \"But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did. The problem was  strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.\",\n",
       " \"Once  Aunt Petunia  tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all  had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs  which she left  to hide that horrible scar.  Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry  who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day  where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.\",\n",
       " \"Next morning  however  he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this  even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.\",\n",
       " \"Another time  Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's  brown with orange puff balls     The harder she tried to pull it over his head  the smaller it seemed to become  until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet  but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and  to his great relief  Harry wasn't punished.\",\n",
       " \"On the other hand  he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when  as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's  there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do  as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard  was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid  jump.\",\n",
       " \"But today  nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school  his cupboard  or Mrs. Figg's cabbage smelling living room.\",\n",
       " 'While he drove  Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work  Harry  the council  Harry  the bank  and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning  it was motorcycles.  . roaring along like maniacs  the young hoodlums   he said  as a motorcycle overtook them. I had a dream about a motorcycle   said Harry  remembering suddenly.  It was flying. ',\n",
       " \"Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry  his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache:  MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY.  Dudley and Piers sniggered. I know they don't   said Harry.  It was only a dream. \",\n",
       " \"But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions  it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't  no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon    they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.\",\n",
       " \"It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then  because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away  they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad  either  Harry thought  licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley  except that it wasn't blond.\",\n",
       " \"Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers  who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime  wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant  and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top  Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt  afterward  that he should have known it was all too good to last.\",\n",
       " \"After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there  with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass  all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge  poisonous cobras and thick  man crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can    but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. In fact  it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass  staring at the glistening brown coils.\",\n",
       " \" Make it move   he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass  but the snake didn't budge.  Do it again   Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles  but the snake just snoozed on.  This is boring   Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\",\n",
       " \"Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself    no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom  where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\",\n",
       " \"The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly  very slowly  it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked  too.\",\n",
       " \"The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley  then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:  I get that all the time.  I know   Harry murmured through the glass  though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him.  It must be really annoying.  The snake nodded vigorously.\",\n",
       " ' Where do you come from  anyway.  Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor  Brazil.  Was it nice there. ',\n",
       " \"The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo.  Oh  I see    so you've never been to Brazil. \",\n",
       " \"As the snake shook its head  a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.  DUDLEY. MR. DURSLEY. COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE. YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING.  Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\",\n",
       " ' Out of the way  you   he said  punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise  Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened    one second  Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass  the next  they had leapt back with howls of horror.',\n",
       " \"Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly  slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.\",\n",
       " 'As the snake slid swiftly past him  Harry could have sworn a low  hissing voice said   Brazil  here I come.. Thanksss  amigo.  The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.  But the glass   he kept saying   where did the glass go. ',\n",
       " \"The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong  sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen  the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed  but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car  Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg  while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all  for Harry at least  was Piers calming down enough to say   Harry was talking to it  weren't you  Harry. \",\n",
       " 'Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say   Go    cupboard    stay    no meals   before he collapsed into a chair  and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.',\n",
       " \"Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later  wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were  he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.\",\n",
       " \"He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years  ten miserable years  as long as he could remember  ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes  when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard  he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn  ing pain on his forehead. This  he supposed  was the crash  though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them  and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\",\n",
       " 'When he had been younger  Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away  but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought  or maybe hoped  that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were  too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man  Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.',\n",
       " \"At school  Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses  and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\",\n",
       " 'The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again  the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera  crashed his remote control airplane  and  first time out on his racing bike  knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.',\n",
       " \"Harry was glad school was over  but there was no escaping Dudley's gang  who visited the house every single day. Piers  Dennis  Malcolm  and Gordon were all big and stupid  but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot  he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\",\n",
       " \"This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house  wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays  where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and  for the first time in his life  he wouldn't be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school  Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry  on the other hand  was going to Stonewall High  the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.  They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall   he told Harry.  Want to come upstairs and practice. \",\n",
       " \" No  thanks   said Harry.  The poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it    it might be sick.  Then he ran  before Dudley could work out what he'd said.\",\n",

It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats  and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years.\",\n",
       " \"That evening  Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new uniform. Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats  orange knickerbockers  and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks  used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\",\n",
       " \"As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers  Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins  he looked so handsome and grown up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\",\n",
       " 'There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.',\n",
       " \" What's this.  he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.  Your new school uniform   she said. Harry looked in the bowl again.\",\n",

       " 'Harry seriously doubted this  but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High    like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin  probably.',\n",

       " \"Harry picked it up and stared at it  his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one  ever  in his whole life  had written to him. Who would. He had no friends  no other relatives    he didn't belong to the library  so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was  a letter  addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy  made of yellowish parchment  and the address was written in emerald green ink. There was no stamp.\",\n",

       " \"Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter  which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope  when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.  That's mine.  said Harry  trying to snatch it back.\",\n",
       " \" Who'd be writing to you.  sneered Uncle Vernon  shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights.

       " 'Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it  but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.  Vernon. Oh my goodness    Vernon. ',\n",
       " \"They stared at each other  seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.  I want to read that letter   he said loudly. want to read it   said Harry furiously   as it's mine. \",\n",

It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month old video camera was lying on top of a small  working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first ever television set  which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage  which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle  which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched. From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother  I don't want him in there. I need that room. make him get out.. \",\n",

Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him  which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting  in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick  Uncle Vernon straightened up  gasping for breath  with Harry's letter clutched in his hand.  Go to your cupboard    I mean  your bedroom   he wheezed at Harry.  Dudley    go    just go. \",\n",

Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big  squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag  clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do.

Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working  but as he slid the first six fat  juicy  slightly burnt sausages from the poker  Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply   Don't touch anything he gives you  Dudley.  The giant chuckled darkly.  Yet great puddin' of a son don' need fattenin' anymore  Dursley  don' worry. \",\n",

You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers  Beaters  Bludgers  and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker  because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points  so they nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught  so it can go on for ages    I think the record is three months  they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.  Well  that's it    any questions.  Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right  it was doing it that was going to be the problem.\",\n",

We must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere    just give us a hint    I know I've read his name somewhere.   I'm sayin' nothin  said Hagrid flatly.  Just have to find out for ourselves  then   said Ron  and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\",\n",
       " \"They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let it slip  because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal. The trouble was  it was very hard to know where to begin  not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century  or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing  too  from Important Modern Magical Discoveries  and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then  of course  there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.\",\n",

Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there. Unfortunately  you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books  and he knew he'd never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts  and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.  What are you looking for  boy.   Nothing   said Harry. Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.  You'd better get out  then. Go on    out. \",\n",

       " \"Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything  but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks  after A  but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks. Five minutes later  Ron and Hermione joined him  shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.\",\n",
       " \" You will keep looking while I'm away  won't you.  said Hermione.  And send me an owl if you find anything.   And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is   said Ron.  It'd be safe to ask them.   Very safe  as they're both dentists   said Hermione.\",\n",
       " \"Once the holidays had started  Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual  so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork    bread  English muffins  marshmallows    and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled  which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work.\",\n",

Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick  hand knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\",\n",

A hundred fat  roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas  silver boats of thick  rich gravy and cranberry sauce    and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought  with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang  it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke  while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live  white mice.
